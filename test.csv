Got take-out from here last night and it was HORRIBLE! Something must have happened because they only had 3 people working and were VERY disorganized. Should have checked the food before we left! Ordered fajitas and there was very little meat... it was beyond ridiculous. Hardly any peppers but a plethora of what looked like stewed tomatoes. Look... I'm a gringa and I know that don't look right and I could do a way better job. The rice was missing completely and there was only one giant pizza pie looking tortilla. We called and the person who answered could barely speak English (which is really not a big deal in my book) but there was no manager around to resolve the situation. We asked for an email so we could send a note about the experience but she was unhelpful. All she offered was for us to come back right then...which if you were as hungry as my fiance was not an option. He gets grumpy and I know better than mess with a grumpy-hungry-pants.
Girls are sweet and prices are reasonable. The stand up bed is hot so make sure you adjust your time ( I might just be super white lol)
Rudest people I have ever encountered.  Husband and wife owned business and when I called for service the wife was unbelievably and unnecessarily rude and demanding.  Don't waste your time calling.
"This airport is only coveted for the destination that it leads its fliers too... the view of the Strip is the only thing that redeems this hotel. The tacky slot machines in the center of the terminal is one thing, but they dont even have a smoker's lounge (its vegas for god's sake!) There are not that many options for food at the airport. Also, it is a TINY airport with a lot of traffic and THE TRAFFIC LINE OF DOOM in itself is a catastrpohe. To its defense, you can drink while you are in line, which i saw many people doing."
"The last 4 months have shown a steady decline in this piss-poor service. Where shall I start?\n\nFor two weeks in a row now, I can count on OnDemand crapping out on Friday evenings. Try to navigate through selections and the entire module shortly becomes a nice blue screen of death and then freezes - no buttons work, no exit, nada. Reboot required. Now the \""2 weeks in a row\"" doesn't just mean it's happened twice. Just twice *in a row* on a Friday evening. OnDemand overall is chronically unstable.\n\nAnd how about trying to record a show? Simple right? Oh think again... We've had several instances over the last couple of months where the last 10 minutes is just POOF - gone. Show ends with a lovely message, \""This show has stopped recording\"" or some such other nonsense. And it's not because the show's schedule got off (i.e. started late, making the end time after the top of an hour).\n\nThen there's the guide showing the name of one show (the one we think we want to record), but when we record and play it back, it's a completely different show! That's always fun.\n\nOh, and lets talk signal quality. For no apparent reason (well, is ANY of this for any apparent reason?) the HD picture will pixelate and become chunky and move sporadically or freeze and the audio sounds like a robot stuck singing the note B flat.\n\nAnd please don't bother trying to use the Search feature in OnDemand. More freezing typically awaits and yep, a reboot is usually required since none of the buttons on the remote can end the nightmare.\n\nYou folks have a LOT of work to do. And I'll bet I'm not wrong in saying you also have a LOT of unhappy customers. And with very good reason. Bad software, bad network, bad delivery, BAD SERVICE. I've never experienced such sustained poor quality from a provider.\n\nTonight was finally the last straw and will be happily entertaining other sources for our TV content next week."
"Excellente bouffe, pas trop cher. L\u00e9gumes et herbes de qualit\u00e9s. Portions g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses. Souvent, le restaurant se remplis rapidement apr\u00e8s 17h, alors pr\u00e9voyez le coup. Recommandable!"
The Phoenician is a dated property and in need of a facelift.  Spend your money elsewhere!
"This is our Sunday after-church destination. Phenomenal hummus, pitas, pizza, and wraps. We like the hummus trio with grilled chicken, add extra pitas and cucumbers. After that go with the mahi mahi. Our kids love the lavash pizza and red lentil soup. Get a half and half of the tropical and green iced tea and they'll always offer up a to-go cup on the way out. \n\nMy wife and I walked to the PJ in Tempe off Apache during college and now have one within biking distance again! Great vibe, healthy delicious food, and good service!"
Happy hour from 2-5pm for slushies and 8-midnight for shakes.
"Hurry in and try this Ginger Cinnamon Latte!! I added carmel sauce and soy milk over ice in their large, a whopping 32oz size, Delish!! The flavor combination was amazing! I would drive out of my way any day for this place. \n\nTucked behind Fox and Hound Pub & Grill this coffee shop is small, but warm and inviting. The staff was very helpful and friendly, my barista even asked me to try this unusual concoction, upon pickup, to make sure I liked it. I was in love! I may have found my new coffee stop. \n\nComparable to *bucks pricing but has a much truer taste without the burnt espresso taste = worth it! They also have a convenient drive up window. (Yay! now I can pickup this coffee goodness in my pjs!)"
"Back in January I had to have my gall bladder removed which was a very unexpected and scary surgery for someone like me who has only ever had my wisdom teeth out. I was referred to Dr. Teng's office by a friend of mine who had the weight loss surgery that is his bread and butter. I should have waited for the doctor who I was referred to in the ER to have an opening but I was in a ton of pain and wanted to have the surgery as soon as possible. It was no surprise that my liver was inflamed and that Dr. Teng said it was the worst gall bladder case he has ever seen, but at least he got it out and although I now have an 8 inch scar it was worth it to no longer be in the kind of pain I was experiencing.\n\nI too had to pay a deposit before the surgery which I did and then six months after the surgery I received a sizable bill. I couldn't understand why after the deposit and my insurance company pitching in he was still expecting me to pay almost $800! With the ER bills leading up to the surgery taxing our finances as well you can imagine I was not thrilled. My husband tried calling the office at least three times to get the scoop on the bill. When it came in the mail it looked sketchy with no actual descriptive information on it. I could have designed a more legitimate looking invoice on my own computer! We wanted to know what we were paying for exactly and why the balance was so much. After three phone calls my husband had still not heard back from the office yet they continued to send out invoices threatening to slap us with a late payment. Honestly, who does not return phone calls?!?!? If you are a business it is what you do! We were very frustrated.\n\nFinally my husband got ahold of Dr. Teng's head secretary or office manager who seems to think very highly of herself. She was very unhelpful and wouldn't answer his questions besides telling him to contact our insurance provider. Again, what kind of business practice is this?\n\nWe paid our bills and hopefully that's the end of it."
"Total loss, the bread was like wonder bread, the pasta was good but the sauce lacked any flavor and the price for the portion was minuscule. You shouldn't go away hungry from a 23 dollar Italian entree."
Horrible service and gave our food to another table
"Let's get fired up! *Claps* and *spirit sprinkles*... sorry the ex-cheerleader couldn't help but think of that chant when I walked in.  =P.  Okay, now we can talk about the joint.  The first thing that came to mind when I walked in was, this place has some character!  What a refreshing change from the overpopulation of chain restaurants on Ray road.  I was greeted immediately as I walked up to the front door, and the service continued to impress me throughout the entire meal.  I was waiting for my friends to arrive, so I decided to take advantage of the last few minutes of Happy hour and order a hummus tray and PAMI tini (Pomegranate martini). The Martini was very good, not as sweet as most places, which I prefer.  The pita bread on the hummus tray was fantastic, toasted just perfectly.  Of the trio we preferred the chipotle and pesto, the jalape\u00f1o cilantro was a little bland and surprisingly not spicy.   For dinner we all ended up ordering the same thing, so I can only report on one item.  It was their baked rotollo ... and it was fantastic!  It was like a huge manicotti stuffed with cheese, veggies and pesto, then topped with more cheese and red sauce.... an Italian vegetarians dream!  Fired up grill is a hidden gem in the middle of the chain mafia in Chandler. I'll definitely be back."
"Overpriced and nothing special. \nMy $15 margarita came in a small cafeteria-style glass with barely any liquor, definitely not enough to get me lit. The $10 beer helped a little. One bite of my $20 burger made me regret even getting food. \nNext time I get the option to go to Margaritaville, I'm choosing AA instead."
"Anyone who says Phoenix lacks culture has yet to visit Symphony Hall. Symphony Hall reflects a sense of Arizona culture in the sense that the architecture reminds of Frank Lloyd Wright's work. The Hall is beautiful and very spacious. Upon stepping foot through the doors of Symphony Hall, I immediately get the sense of being in a booming metropolis. The staff is friendly and helpful and they even have a local shop where you can buy different gifts. \n\nThe acoustics at Symphony Hall are very nice and I doubt there's a bad seat in the house. The symphony does an excellent job with their quality and sound level of their music and it compliments the performers on stage...even a cat's meow would sound beautiful! The entire performance center is gorgeous and I think it's a must-visit if you live in Phoenix. You have your choice between the Symphony, Ballet AZ and the Opera so pick your performance poison and discover Symphony Hall!"
"The airport is in need of an update.  It is very lack luster, there are very few healthy options for food (although this is common for airports) and there are still random Oxygen bars (do people still use these?).  The bathrooms are pretty dirty.  They have some corporate sponsored \""charging stations\"" but they are typically crowded and you can see people up and down the terminals either sitting on the floor or hustling to grab spots when they open.  Unless you are coming to or leaving LV, there are much better spots to have to lay over."
"First off, the service is pretty good. The guys were very nice and helpful. I ordered some Garlic Knots, which were very tasty. However, I came inside to check in on the knots and saw the gentalmen that was doing the finishing touches on them using his bare hands to put the parmesan on the top. Now I am kind of picky about stuff like that, so that's why one star was taken away. Other than that, their pizza was pretty amazing, the dough was a little thin, but overall great quality."
"Have been here three times.  Once with wife and 2 kids, and twice with work buddies.  All 3 times the food was excellent, the service was top notch, and the atmosphere was fine.\nVisit 1: The Camarones Special recommended by the server was incredible.  It was Friday so they had cheap Dos XX Lager deal going.  Wife's meal was a quesadilla that was huge and delicious.  \nVisit 2: Got the Carne Asada Tacos, also chosen by same server.  She has great taste.  These were incredible.  More Dos XX Lager.  Buddy got Chicken enchiladas and said the \""best he ever had.\""\nVisit 3: Acalpulco(?) Fish Tacos.  Not bad.  Huge meal and I was starving so that worked out.  It was a different server so I went out on my own.  Shows what I know.  Still a great time and I do not regret my choice.  Look forward to trying more from 1900.  Did try the guac, which was pretty good.\n\nI will be disappointed when my work in Charlotte is over.  This place is great.  The missing star?  Their salsa is average at best.  The corn relish is great, but salsa needs improvement."
This is the absolute worst nail salon I've ever been to! Never will I go there again and I would not recommend this place to anyone! My nails have never looked so awful and they started to come off within a week. I have no idea how this place is still even getting business\n\nI wouldn't even give this place 1 star if I had that option
"Skip this place and go to another gate if you have time. If you dont have time, I would reccomend a Nathan's hotdog or something out of the trash.\n\nThe place reeked of old beer, the waitstaff seemed overwhelmed and were not too interested in making good time despite being near the gates of an airport."
Really should deal with their rotten trash dead animal smell. Haven't been there for a while and hope they improve it.
Hands down so far the best cheap eats pizza I have had in Pittsburgh. Big slices and the ones I have had (usually with garlic) have been loaded with lots of flavor. One is more than enough for me. Not particularly greasy like you would think for a pizza join and just oh so tasty. The crust is crisp and I like how after you make your pizza selection they warm it up in the oven. I haven't had anything else on their menu except for side salads with balsamic dressing (weird consistency initially though fine after mixing around) though I am very tempted to try their wings. Another perk is that they are opened late.
"took my mustang for diagnostic and oil change, everything they told me was false, car came back with 5 defective brake lights, car now runs worse than before, car was disgusting when it came back. you guys suck! dont go here if you love your car, their mechanics are shi*t! worst customer service!!\n\nupdate* ford were wrong about my diagnosis that i paid $130 for!\n\nall i needed was an o2 sensor that should have been warrantied by law as the car is less than 7 years old and has less than 70,000 miles. guess ill be looking further into this"
Usually love this place. But tonight I tried ordering to go and the guy Daniel kept fighting me on the menu and that I was ordering wrong. I have been ordering the same thing since it first opened. I know what it is and what it comes with. He was arguing  with me. So of course I hung up. I called again 10 min later to try again and maybe get someone else and he was still fighting me on it. I hung up because at this point I am furious. I am calling tonight to talk to a manager because customer service is #1 to me and he made it horrible. I love this place but his fighting me is making me not want to go there for awhile.
"I actually haven't been here in years but I do remember it well.  I think if you love seafood, this place is totally worth it.  There was so much seafood I didn't know what to eat.  I think everyone generally goes for the crab as most of my friends did.  Since I've never been a big Alaskan crab fan, I ended up mostly seafood noodles.  Pretty good seafood noodles, but they really are just noodles with seafood.  For me it was not worth it because of what I like, but I definitely recommend it to those seafood lovers."
I made an appointment to get a flu shot here.  got several emails telling me not to forget and when I showed up at 8 am on a Monday morning a girl shrugs her shoulders and tells me they are not doing flu shots that day.  after I missed two hours of work this sucks.  never going to cvs again it is always a bad idea no matter which location you go to.
Don't go here for food unless you want to wait in lines forever.  Every restaurant or deli has the longest and slowest functioning lines.
"I met a colleague here for lunch and we dined in the Grille area.  He works in Fountain Hills and picked this place.  It's kind of out of the way for me, but the food here is solid, so I can't complain.\n\nI had the Cheeseburger Sliders and Fries.  They were excellent.  Service here is impeccable.  The servers made sure we were well attended to and kept our drink glasses full.  I'd like to come back and have dinner sometime.\n\nThe vibe here is stuffy country club...so if that's not your deal, don't come here.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
The food was delicious. Got the red curry with beef. Wife got fried rice. We'll be going back.
"Dude, LAX sucks.  It's like a hallway packed with sweaty old men, plus a balcony with more sweaty old men staring down.\n\nThey have absolutely no line system.  That just packs everyone into the \""waiting area\"" until someone pushes and shoves their way through the entrance and slips the bouncer a twenty.\n\nI know it's Vegas and I have to lower my standards, but LAX just sucks donkey balls.  Sweaty ones.  Gross."
"This restaurant has a sign up sheet outside the front door. It is very easy to keep tabs of our placement on the list. There were several names ahead of us when we signed in. Our family of 5 looked forward to breakfast. After waiting 45 minutes one couple was ahead of us.When the bus boy seated that couple, he also seated a couple who had just arrived, placing them at a large table for 5 or 6 people. It turns out one of the members of the couple was his brother. We complained to the manager about preferential seating of the second couple ahead of us. She would not acknowledge the problem or offer an apology. Instead she made excuses pointing to a previous customer name to cover up their mistake. Either she is clueless or a liar. We left and went to Biscuits and had a great meal. \n\nIf i could give this restaurant zero stars, I would have. The rudeness was an insult!"
This was a great burger experience. I had he bbq bacon burger and smash fries. I called in the order and ate most of the fries on my 10 minute ride home because I was afraid that thy would be nasty cold. I was wrong! My fiance had the sweet potato fries. They were still yummy once we got them home. I have driven by this place many times and will be back soon!
Great place to go for that unique home decor gift for that hard to buy for person.  The inventory is always changing to keep up with the seasons which makes random visits so much fun.  The staff and owners are the salt of the earth kind of folks that make me so glad they decided to hang their shingle up here in Las Vegas. They will go out of your way to help you not to mention have you laughing and smiling because they are super personable.  Also the prices are more that reasonable and they off a military discount (thank you much).
"The only reason I go to Walmart if either because I was some crap that's dirt cheap or I need a fishing license. Well, it's that time of the year again to get that license! Dropped by later at night when my other errands were over, spent about 5 minutes with the licensing guy, but he said I had to pay up front since he closed his register (10:30PM). He told me I had to go to register 15, too. Now this license for all water ways with trout stamp and two pole stamp was about $60.00, and it was in my hand. A less honest man would've just left but not me. \n\nI wish I had. There were three people in front of me in lane 15 (NO ONE in other lanes), and it took 30 minutes. It was because 1. I was in the only cigarette line! 2. The cashier was very slow. 3. The drawer was not well stocked and she called for change every two minutes.\n\nI got home at 11:15PM, and I am glad my fishing license is good until 2010!!!"
I have been trying to sign up for about 1 week now!!! No one knows anything about discounted fees with your health insurance plan. UnitedHealth care offers a discount  for a gym membership. Golds being one of them. I printed the form and staff knows NOTHING!!! I also called UnitedHealth care just to make sure and yes we do get a discount. I also sent an email to golds headquarters NO REPLY
"4 stars or 4 $$$$?  the answer is both.\n\nthe crowd was for the most part older and conservative. \nbut the life of the party was right at the bar and his name was \""rich.\""\n\nwhy the high costs?  part of the money is for the beautiful view and decor but the coolest cost goes to tracking the fish shipments as they are delivered from the mediterranean.\n\ni like big and bold wines so the i'll borro 05 toscana was just that but the\nyounger 07 dolcetto d'alba was smooth but felt high in tannins.\n\n1. the sauteed clams with tomato sauce, garlic, white wine and parsley was very tasty.  good enough to sop up the broth with bread.\n\n2. the lasganette pasta with lobster, shrimp, white wine and tomato was good but the pasta was sadly overcooked.\n\n3. the fish is always good to share since the portions are large but they do carry a special of the day where they have individual filets.  that night, they carried the gallinella which is similar to a light sole.  unfortunately, the garlic overpowered it.  only the texture from the artichoke and the acidity from the tomato saved the dish.\n\nsadly, there was no time for dessert as we had a show to catch.  sniff.\n\ndespite some little misses, the overall experience was just wonderful."
"Five stars for our neighbors to the North and this most impressive piece of architecture. I will agree with other people that it is showing age but the view is worth the ( bloated ) price as you'll never probably get to do it again. The stadium itself has not seen baseball in many years and one worker was proud to tell me that the stadium recently hosted an AC/DC concert ( which my wife and I chuckled at since they are yesterdays news ) but for the once in a lifetime chance to see Montreal from many angles, it was worth the experience."
I have nothing but positive things to say about Henry's place. My whole family and I have been taking our cars to him for years and we have never been let down. I recommend him to everyone. BEST mechanic in town!!
"Most amazing hotel pool I've ever seen!  My room had a great view of the pool so before heading to work I would wish I was going there.\n\nLove the variety of pools - wave pool, lazy river, regular pools.  Wow!\n\nTons of lounge chairs to hang out.  Special cabanas for a price (not sure what that price is).\n\nAt the entrance you get a towel and they advise you that alchol is not allowed even though the waiter at the restaurant nearby sold you an overpriced margarita to go...  we just denied we had alchol and were let in (the young guy at the door didn't seem to care but still that waiter knew we were going to the pool so I'm not sure why he told us to get a margarita if you really shouldn't bring them in).\n\nAnyway, my only real complaint is the hours.  I wished it was open longer, especially in the morning before work when it's sunny out."
"I know that sometimes, the ratings on these kind of sites are low and people exaggerate. But Arcadia Del Sol fully deserves its one star rating. \n1. The water is always off. ALWAYS. It is either fully turned off or the hot water is off. It happens several times a month. They never actually fix the problem, they just band-aid it up and wait for it to happen again. For all of the money that Allison-Shelton makes off of this place, they don't put very much back into it.\n2. Which brings me to my second point. They just put a TON of money into painting to attract new residents instead of taking care of their current residents and fixing the existing problems (such as the water, a/c, etc.)\n3. They are SHADY!!!! I lived in an apartment where the a/c did not work (they finally admitted it after about a year of me complaining and they told me it was all in my head basically). They said the whole column of apartments did not work, and that they were not moving anyone into any of them. We switched apartments and literally a month later they moved someone into our apartment.\n4. They advertise a lot of features that are pretty much non-existent. They advertise 2 pools (always green and uncleaned), a gym (that was taken out years ago), a courtyard (that is covered in dog poop), and a lobby room for events (that they are currently using as storage).\n5. Everything around here is SO old and falling apart. The countertops are some old material from the 70s that if you get a drop of ANYTHING with color on it, it will be permanently stained (that's not an exaggeration). My faucets leak, my carpets are stained, the closet doors don't function (ie they sit there, they dont really open), etc.\n6. Lastly, the marijuana. They say they serve the drug users in the community with papers for fines and asking them to stop, etc. and the residents deny they use marijuana.... why not just evict them? Because the apartment complex only cares about the money.\n\nThis apartment complex has so much potential but unfortunately, the management is awful and I am so thrilled to be moving at the end of my lease."
By far the slowest Jiffy Lube I have ever stopped at. Thought I would be in and out in a few minutes because no one was in front if me but it took over an hour.
The food is definitely something that needs improvement! The pizza dough is tasteless and overall in need of improvement. Burgers and wings are just average bar food  - nothing special at all. If you like to bet on horse and dog races then this maybe your place to go.
"We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone."
"This review is only for the seafood department in the store.\n\nI'm not an idiot, I realize that trying to buy fresh seafood in the Phoenix area is not one of the greatest ideas one could have, but I live in Boston and make my living as a fish monger/fish cook.  So I know about fish, and my family was hoping that i would cook for them while I'm out here.\n\nThis place was a fail as soon as I walked to the counter.  The shell fish were all kept on plates above the ice and I noticed that several mussels and clams had already opened.\n\nNot only should shell fish be kept directly on ice, part way buried in the stuff is best, and if you loose a few in the process of the day you take them out of the case and dispose of the them.  Not leave them out for everyone to see that your not keeping your seafood cold and just letting it go south.  You may as well keep it out side in the trunk of your car.  Spoiled seafood is spoiled seafood.  I don't care if you do put it on a shiny platter and put a \""sale\"" sticker on it.\n\nI ended up having to make do with some frozen flounder, I brought them home and thawed them out, only to find they were SATURATED with water, I actually had to hold them over the sink and gently squeeze water out of them.  In the years I've worked with all manner of fish, I've never actually had wring a fish dry like it was some sort of towel.   \n\nHonest to god, I twisted the ends until the fillets started to curl, then they started realizing an truly unusual amount of fluids.  It was disgusting."
"Its okay place, but I recommend go eat at the Palms for late night food, the Palms is cheaper and taste better.\n\nLate."
"Since there was no escaping my worries by whisking myself away to Puerto Vallarta this weekend...I did the next best thing. I over-indulged in scents. 200 of them to be exact.\n\nI took a seat at the bar and instead of ordering a stiff drink, I grabbed a blank paper tab and begin mixing scents. Would it be liquid valium (lavender, mandarin orange and bergamot) or perhaps a little southern tropics (oatmeal, milk & honey and mango)?\n\nNo...I needed something bold and strong. I created what I'd like to call 'therapy'... chocolate, butterscotch and Columbian coffee.\n\nThe next decision was what to mix it in. Face lotions, shampoos, body wash and room mists to name a few. It's all earth friendly and cruelty free. They even have scents and shampoos for the K-9's!"
"Just like my home Hot Dogs in Hermosillo by the University.\nThey are rich and gigantic, so show up hungry!"
I paid the extra money to bypass the long line and it was well worth it. I didn't want to wait 1 hour in line with no guarantees that the line would move very quickly. I recommend seeing the view at night so you can see the sunset and the spectacular Bellagio water show. The view is worth the price of admission. The Eiffel Tower is an actual half size of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
"Cha Ching! Cha Ching!  This place hits the jackpot for me. The \""Perfect burger\"" was truly perfection.  It made my last meal on earth list and my list is really short.  WOW!! It was so good my hubby and I came back for seconds within a 4 day span. We also had the sliders, and the #8 burger...but we still went back to the \""perfect burger\"". I also loved the sweet potato fries and the onion rings...yum! To top it off I ordered the mojito...a tall minty glass on a hot Las Vegas day....YEEESSSS!!"
"Because of Yelp I made the long trek to get these for myself and my co-workers for lunch today.  I'm super glad I did.\n\nI got the Big Box special.  The chicken was supergood - nice and crunchy without being too much batter or feeling too greasy.  The chicken was plump and juicy and REAL.  I totally dug the sauce - it was a bit more on the tangy and peppery side than I thought it would be and was a nice surprise.  I didn't like the cole slaw, but that's no surprise since I generally don't like any cole slaw since I abhor cabbage in most of it's states.  The Texas Toast was aweeesome.\n\nAll in all, it was a little out of my way but it was totally worth it.  My co-workers made the mistake of getting a 25 piece tailgater thinking that the two of them could finish it.  All I know is that now I have stuff to eat tonight."
This was my first visit (3/29/11).  I was a bit underwhelmed.  I knew it was the largest buffet line and that is fine with me.  The majority of the selections looked like they had been there a while which translated into some dry chicken.  The lamb shank and crab was decent.
"Alas, this place seems to be getting worse and worse over the years. I tried it again last week because it was Monday and Saigon Noodles was closed. I just wanted soup. I ordered the Tom Yum. \nIt comes with a little salad. It was fresh and good but the dressing was pure sugar. My daughter had the chicken satay. The peanut sauce barely resembled peanuts. It was also really, really sweet and had a few peanuts in it. My soup was sour-- not that nice sweet/sour mix that is typical with Tom Yum-- just sour. It was edible though so I ate it.\nTo get in and out for under $20 was nice and the service was pretty good.\nBottom line: if you are on the West Side of Madison on a Monday and want soup... lower your standards and eat here. Otherwise, go to Saigon Noodle or (if you really, really need Thai food) head to Ha Long Bay on Willie Street."
"All those out of work used car salesmen had to end up somewhere... \n\n\nI furnished an entire place with electronics and furniture from RC Willey, and would strongly advise against giving them your business. \n\nThe sales staff here are very commission driven, which is obvious when you start talking with them. I felt a little pressure to purchase certain items over others from the salesman helping me out. I grew very turned off by the whole experience. \n\nI had to buy and exchange three different couches before we found one that fit through the front door of my apartment. Every time something didn't work, I ended up at the end of the delivery list, going weeks before having a couch to sit on. Once they have your money, the quality of customer service falls apart. \n\nAlso, they are not open on Sundays, so plan on taking time out of your busy work week to be hassled by a slimy sales personnel. \n\nThe positive note is that I like the furniture I purchased, although I imagine I could find other items somewhere that provides a much better all-around experience."
"Great steak sandwich and the fries have a great taste without any sauce. My wife had Mamas burger, the bun and mushrooms were great tasting, but the meat lacks flavor. We will give this place another try."
"Remember in the 90s when Kyoto Bowl was good and you could page your friend, he'd call you and you could ask him to stop by the Blockbuster to pick up Terminator II swing by the Kyoto Bowl and grab you a Teriyaki Bowl?  \n\nThen that dude stole your girlfriend, you got an iPhone, Blockbuster closes virtually every store around, and Kyoto Bowl started serving awful food that smells like bile in a bowl.  \n\nAt least you still have Terminator II.....now on DVD with bonus features.  \n\nIf you're tempted to re-live the 90's at the Kyoto Bowl, just play some Pearl Jam and grow your goatee out instead.  You'll be happy you did."
"Interesting business indeed, the place is setup like a hangout for either vampires or individuals with hangovers except that terrible music they play is turned up way too loud for the latter.  Really, the only thing this place has going for it is the fact that there are indeed worse places out there.  To start, the staff are completely lackadaisical and couldn't care less about you being there.  Second, not only is the menu a complete fail but the food itself is even worse.  On a nutritional scale the fair scores about a 2 yet it is not even remotely enjoyable.  The food seriously has zero flavor, if they changed to strictly boiled chicken with no seasoning I'd be a step up.  This place takes the cake for the least flavorful food of any restaurant I've ever been to.  To boot the seating is as uncomfortable as could be found anywhere and the bar is pretty weak as well.  I'm not quite sure of the reason for this restaurant's existence."
"I went here with my daughter, her 4 year old twins, and a friend visiting from AZ with her 5 year old. I've been here before and had a great experience, but apparently things have changed. The cashier in the gift shop was rude and treated us like we were interrupting her. I ended up not buying anything because of her Crappy attitude. There was only a short wait for a table which was a surprise because the other times I've been here (more than 3 years ago) the line was always very long. Once seated though, we had a bit of a wait before we were able to place our order (15 minutes or so, which is a long time with kids that age). Finally placed our order, which was basic stuff, 3 kids meals, a couple of burgers and a soup in a bread bowl.  We did receive our drinks right away, but waited over 1 hour for our food. I would have asked our waitress to check on our order sooner, but We didn't even see her again until then. Once I was able to ask where our food was she scurried back to the kitchen and immediately brought everything out. It had all obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time, but because the kids were anxious to eat we didn't complain.  The adult food was quite good in spite of having been left sitting for so long, but the kids meals were very disappointing. One plate had 4 French fries on it, another had a giant mound of fries, and the other was somewhere in between. The grilled cheese was 2 super thick slices of bread with one thin little slice of cheese, and the chicken nuggets were just heated up frozen dinosaur nuggets. For $10 a plate it seems like they could have made their own chicken nuggets and threw on another slice of cheese. I don't know what our friend paid for her soup and 1 kids meal, but the bill for me, my daughter and 2 grand kids came to $68 dollars, which was for 2 kids meals, 2 burger meals, 1 soda, 1 iced tea and 2 waters for the kids.  To be fair, my burger was very good, but really, almost $70 for that? Based on this experience we won't be going back. To put us thru the torture of sitting at a table with 3 kids that age for over an hour waiting for sub standard food, and to charge such a ridiculous amount of money for it is inexcusable."
"I think this restaurant is way over rated for the money spent.\nOn the upside,the waiter was very polite and professional and overall the food was\ngood,not great but good. One the down side of things, when a meal costs over\na hundred dollars a meal and  the wines start at ninety dollars I expect exceptional\nfood and exceptional service for these prices.All of the foods were served barely warm or cold, servings were small. they have two unisex restrooms and after waiting in line,most people left the restaurant to wash and relieve themselves.\nThe only thing exceptional about this restaurant is the appearence  of the way the\nfood was prepared,other than that.this is only a average restaurant."
"This restaurant by far has the worst service I have ever experienced!! I will NEVER go back!! Not only do they have bad service, but their manager and owner failed to even see the problem that an hour and a half wait time to receive our food was. The manager and owner were very rude, disrespectful, condescending, and unprofessional. They proceeded to tell our party that they accommodated us in seating our party of 12 because we took up table space in their patio. Not only this, but after hearing our complaints of our service the manager said that we had great service that our food only took 45 mins to get to our table. Basically calling all 12 of us liars. I cannot give this place a bad enough review. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially if you are visiting Chandler. If you go despite this review with a group larger than 8, make sure that you all take cash. They have a restaurant policy that they will NOT divide up the check, and you can only pay with one credit card or with cash. Apparently this policy is written in fine print on their menu. Therefore, the server did not disclose this information to our party. When it came time to pay we all had credit cards. It took us over 2 hours to speak with management and the owner about these issues. Nothing was resolved. In the end the server separated our bill and the manager and owner acted as though they did us a favor. Again I CANNOT give this restaurant a low enough rating! \n\nEl Zocalo is El Suckalo!!!!"
"One of the worst experiences I've ever had in Scottsdale.  These folks need to head back to NYC and take their terrible food, service and bad attitude with them.   \n\nI cannot believe all the good reviews here.   \n\nThere were eight of us so they automatically add the tip and boy did we pay for it.   The terrible waiter who admitted he was from buffalo complained about us right to our face and the odd thing is we didn't do anything at all.  Owner came over at the end of he night and told me that you don't have to like everybody as he doesn't like his ex wives (?) and they didn't need our business as they're always packed. He also suggested I write a terrible review so I thought I should.  \n\nFood is expensive and below average. \n\nDefinitely not worth it."
"Updated: Echo Canyon renovation. Echo Canyon used to be my favorite trail but after this new renovation it sucks.\n\nParking is worse than before if that's even possible. I went on a typical Thursday afternoon and the park rangers still had to turn people away. \n\nAs soon as you turn into the lot there is a barricade with a park ranger letting people in one at a time as soon as there is a spot available. This would be a good idea but the barricade is so close to the road that only about 5 cars can wait for a spot and not be blocking the main road.  This is very poor planning in my opinion.\n\nAs for the trail itself: they took out the stairs in the beginning and made it very steep with compressed gravel. This is actually harder than the stairs and I could definitely see people slipping off more easily.\n\nI would not bring anyone that is out of shape to this trail. Also our furry friends are no longer welcome (no dogs allowed).\n\nOnce you get past the parking and the \""improvements\"" to the  beginning of the trail, it is the old Echo Canyon that we all used to know and love."
"I am so angry that I have put off stopping by Frankie's for so long! What an idiot!\n\nThis place has gone above and beyond to create their tiki room vibe. Tiki's, tiki's and more tiki's, blow fish lights and a ton of other little eccentricity's give this place a funky Polynesian feel. \n\nAnd their drinks, I am going to spend the rest of my days in Vegas trying every one of their signature cocktails, and damn it I will own every tiki souvenir cup they make!  \n\nDo yourself a huge favor and check out Frankie's and you won't be disappointed."
"Good recipes, nice atmosphere, and an interesting menu are frequently ruined by inattentiveness in the kitchen.  Meats are often dry, tough, and overcooked, though the vegetarian options are still delicious.  Ali Baba is a place with a lot of potential, but it needs more skilled professionals behind the curtain.\n\n(Also, the water glasses are unusually small, requiring many refills and usually causing periods without water during a meal--you can ask for a bigger one, though, something I didn't learn until my third visit.)"
"The worst Gentlemen's Club experience EVER! I arrived with a group of 12 good friends for my brother's bachelor party. The first of many surprises was not being on the Comp list that we were put on by a reliable friend who works with the place. Second, was paying $30 each. Third we had to buy a bottle for $380 (didn't tell us about the $80 gratuity fee) just to have a place where we could all sit down. They stuck us for $740 before we even sat down. The venue is supposed to be one of the largest in the world, but only have about 15 seats in front of the stages. If you don't find a seat there you must buy a $380 bottle to sit in the other 200-300 seats. Nice ratio. This place is designed to rip off people, and for grand finale the girls were not up to par. This is an honest review from a good person who doesn't require much."
"I was really excited to visit the Wrigley for my friends birthday. I have been meaning to try this place for years and the Yelp hype has been pretty strong. I was immediately impressed by the staff, we had a very big group and they were attentive and got our drinks and orders in right away. The view of the city was breathtaking and I would come back for happy hour, but just to watch the sunset and a have a cocktail. \n \nThat being said... Geordie's restaurant had horrible food. Honestly, one star at best. I had the Cesar salad which was fishy with stale croutons. I also tried the beet and goat cheese salad and I kept looking around for the goat cheese, I had one small dollop hiding under a bib of lettuce. The carpaccio was the worst I have ever tasted. I think the cut may have been bad and I couldn't take more than two bites. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries; they were the only part of my meal that was anything more than mediocre. For my main I had the tenderloin and it was tough and chewy, the potatoes that came on the side were a joke. \n \nI've been told that Wrigley has the \""pay what you will\"" for lunch. If they applied this to the dinner they served I would left with a much heavier wallet. All in all the over hyped experience left me quite under whelmed. Sure it is a great place to impress your out of town guests with, for the view and history alone. Just take them somewhere else for dinner (like Dick's or Caf\u00e9 Barrio) if you want an impressive meal."
"Ok boss, here goes in Italian then...Presentandomi avevo detto anche che ero con un amico italiano, sarebbe stato adeguato porre pi\u00f9 attenzione alla cottura della pasta. Siamo arrivati verso orario di chiusura, non abbiamo voluto chiedere di cucinare di nuovo per noi. Per quanto riguarda gli ingredienti del sugo, gradirei conoscere quali sono allora questi ingredienti che al mio palato ricordavano origano e rosmarino. Comunque la nostra recensione non era del tutto negativa ( 3stelle ) ma giustamente critica per migliorare il servizio di un ristorante/grocery italiano. Capito?"
"The rooms are large and nice, and the price is right.  The free airport shuttle was a big help and is very much appreciated.  The casino was large and had pretty good action, despite some terrible luck at the poker tables (it should be noted the poker room had a bunch of tables going, even at 3am).  One problem is that the pool is pretty cold and there is no hot tub for kids.  I like that the main hot tub is adults only, but they need another one, especially if the pool is so cold, where kids would be allowed.  This is a very good place to go if you have kids with you, and a pretty good place to go if you are an adult and want to save some money on a weekend trip (as long as you can live without being on the strip).  Note they now have a $14 resort fee, which is relatively fair given the good coupon book you get when you check in and the free shuttle to the airport."
"Wow. Some amazingly gourmet poutine here. Gravy obviously made from painstakingly reduced beef stock, rather than thickeners.  Deliciously sauteed red peppers. Fresh curds. A serious step above your average Montreal poutine."
"Went here for Mother's day since it was close to home and we were craving Indian.  I've had Indian food all over Vegas and this was one of the worst experiences.  I really wanted to like the place as I love to support local mom and pop establishments but this was quite disappointing.  We ordered the chicken korma, lamb vindaloo, veggie samosa and some garlic naan.  The chicken korma tasted off and was really oily.  The lamb vindaloo also did not taste like other vindaloos we've had, this tasted a little too tangy.  The garlic naan tasted like it was reheated in a microwave so it got hard and chewy once it cooled down.  The only saving grace was the vegetable samosa, which was filled with potatoes and peas and had good flavor.\n\nI wish I could say that I'd try this place again, but I think I'll just drive further and go to the Mint or India Palace for better indian food."
"Where else can you catch a sporting event or concert for less than $20?  With lots of parking and reasonably priced food and drinks, this is the place to be to watch all your favorite artists that are not headliners on the strip.  I just recently watched the SWV and Joe concert... it was well worth it."
"Expensive, but worth every dollar! steaks melt in your mouth and seasoning is personalized!"
"My boyfriend & I reserved this room because it was one of the cheaper hotels on the Vegas strip; so we were in no way expecting the luxury of the Bellagio. But during our 3 night stay we were increasingly annoyed with the problems in the hotel & unhelpful front desk staff. I will never be staying here again, I don't care how good of a deal it is. \n\n#1- The door to the Bungalow building takes about 15 tries to unlock. They need a new lock on that building, badly. \n\n#2- The adjoining door between our room & the room next to us didn't lock on our side (lock was broken), so the neighbors could have come into our room if they wanted to. \n\n#3- We had to have maintenance come fix the toilet first thing in the morning on 2 of our days there. \n\nAll of that could have been forgiven. They have $1.50 beers in their bars, $3 blackjack tables, a decent pool (even though the waterfall was broken), and a pretty convenient location. BUT.... \n\n#4- On day 2 I decided I didn't want to pay for the hotel with my debit card & asked the hotel to switch over to my credit card. To make a long story short they screwed it up & ended up tying up $536 in charges & holds on my credit & debit accounts, for a room that cost $181 total. Supposedly they submitted a reversal for the charges, but I have yet to see it process on my account (it's been 2 days so far).\n\nI went to the desk to complain to the manager (who first off had the front desk girl tell me that the manager was out on lunch, then she magically appeared after I wasn't going away), who did absolutely nothing but give me a blank stare. I resorted to listing all of the other complaints I had about the hotel in an attempt to get a reaction from her, or at least some sort of compensation, but she still said nothing other than \""I'm sorry about that\"". I became so frustrated I ended up leaving the hotel in tears. \n\nI was expecting a budget hotel because that's what I paid for; I was NOT expecting a VACATION RUINER. I won't be returning to this craphole, not even for their $1.50 beers, simply because I'm so pissed at my experience here.\n\nIf you do come to Hooters, just go for the cheap drinks & gambling. Go down the street to Imperial Palace if you're looking for a cheap room."
Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.
"There's so many yummy Thai places I can't keep up these days. I love the customer service here, it has an americanized atmosphere because of that, but the food is still true to it's culture. By the time we finished eating and were ready for dessert, they had already run out of their mangos and sticky rice which we were so desperate to try. It was a sad moment, but just another reason to go back."
"Went here last night  after  along drive from California and a few hours on the casino floor. The server and service was fabulous and fast. Our young girl server was super nice and kept up with everything. The atmosphere was also well designed and comfortable, not loud and quite pleasant. My GF and I shared the Grilled Sword Fish, The fish was cooked improperly. It was so Salt water fishy tasting and rubbery we couldn't  finish. The appetizers saved the night and were outstanding. \""Or server recommended Shrimp over Corn Bread with a reduced sauce, this was to die for and would recommend. Then we ordered the Buffalo wings, these also were nothing to rave about. The sauce was not to tasty, I've had better wings from Costco out of a bag and cooked in an oven. My son had the Fish Taco's, he ate them so I'm assuming they were ok, he's not much for opinions. His GF had a Bacon wrapped meatloaf. She had all of us try her selection as she was cracking up on the taste. We all came to the same conclusion that the Meatloaf tasted like a \""Slim Jim\"" Jerky. I'm guessing we are not going back soon and will try another restaurant for dinner."
"We stayed at Palazzo over the holidays and decided to try out this place.  I had made reservations for 9pm but arrived about 20mins early and was seated right away.  Overall a decent experience.\nAmbience:  Dark and somewhat trendy sushi fusion joint.  There is a bar area but the rest of the tables are set up in a funky circular fashion.  Tables are pretty close to each other and you will not have a private dining experience.  \nService:  For the most part good.  We were seated right away.  It did take a while for the server to get to us (and she apologized).  She didn't give us the Sushi Samba intro like I heard another server give the table next to us (explaining the whole fusion thing).  Orders were taken and things proceeded to go smoothly.  There were no mistakes on our order.  We asked for sake recommendations and she appeared really knowledgeable.  She was decent in explaining their omikase (pretty much no set omikase).  Food came out at a decent pace.  Water was refilled quite nicely too.\nFood:  Past review said that this was a great sushi place.  I disagree.  If you want the best sushi, you don't go to a fusion place in Vegas for it.  If you want to try a different twist on japanese/brazillian cuisine, then this is the place. So I went here without much expectations.  Highlights included the Yellowtail taquitos (more like tacos).  I loved the sauce/foam that came with it.  Very light and a nice way to wet your appetite.  Sea bass and Lamb Robata (sp?) were both really really good.  There was a sweet sauce on both.  Sea bass melted in your mouth.  Came with 2 skewers.  The lamb was a decent size and was sliced thinly.  This was also a melt-in-your mouth experience.  I would order both again. We had one of their specials which was a white fish in a tofu sauce.  It was just ok.  We made the mistake of ordering a roll.  I think it was an El Toro (or something like that) and it came with salmon, cilantro, mozerella cheese, among other things.  The flavor was ok, but the rice in the roll itself was really hard.  Like they had premade it.  Made the whole roll just awful.  I like their sake selection.  We passed on dessert.\nValue:  Just like vegas, things are pricier. But I thought the vibe was decent.  \n\nAll in all, a decent date night place.  Just don't come expecting over the top sushi."
"Pretty regular sushi and teppanyaki.  Not a lot of tricks at all with the teppan.  Everything costs 2-3x normal retail cost it seems like.  Salad was decent, though the dressing a bit acidic.  I've had better miso soup, didn't taste authentic at all.  The grilled meats were ready over 10 min before the grilled veggies were.  The dessert wasn't very good - the best thing was the flourless mini cake with lychee creme(?) in the middle.  The mochi ice cream was way worse than the store bought ones - the rice cake was hard and stale tasting due to the ice cream (why reinvent the wheel?).  The sake syrup shot thing just tasted how flowery scents smell.  Just weird.\n\nDefinitely not worth the money.  Try a different place!"
Ah... a one hour massage is amazing... but a TWO hour massage is only allowed in heaven!\n\nthe short little lady with the soft voice has some STRONG hands... worked out every knot in my whole body!! and it was amazing.. i was relaxed the whole next day as well :) this was the perfect remedy after a very long work week :)\n\nall of the employees are so nice and professional... i feel soo comfortable and relaxed there... its my favorite get away :)\n\neveryone should get one once a month... :) doctors orders!
"I tend to judge a Mediterranean restaurant by their shawarma and falafel, since these are pretty standard and easy to make right (or hard to mess up, if you prefer that phrase). I've been to this place three times, all three times I haven't been impressed. Their shawarma doesn't have a very good flavor, and the falafel sandwich is too dry. I understand that falafel is dry in nature, but it shouldn't be this dry. Btw, the shawarma is dry too, but it seemed better after the falafel. The gyro wrap was alright, but still nothing great.\n\nI would consider driving to La Shish Kabob or even Zeitoni all the way in Ballantyne before I go to this place again."
"ok, i'm biased because i am an adict and i live, oops, i mean work in the siebel center where this is located.  but the truth of the matter is this: i travel constantly for work and pleasure, i've tasted the best coffees in the world, and this stuff works for me.  it's better than starbucks, similar to peet's, almost as good as illy just to give you a commercial perspective.  i love the fact that i don't even need to speak to get what i want.  as soon as they see you coming, they start making your usual.  it's not just me either, i've watched many people get the silent treatment...which is exactly what you want when you are deep in conversation with an exciting computer scientist.  but just in case you have time to chat...they are a delightful bunch and the manager jane even gives great fashion advice...one more thing to feel guilty about being in the most gorgeous computer science building in the country."
"Yes, please!\n\nLove In & Out. \n\n#2 Animal Style is like sex."
"I came to Feeney's looking for steak with my family. I ended up ordering the lamb chops which did not disappoint. However, I finished off the remains of a teriyaki steak, and loved every bite. The mashed potatoes were tasty, and the gravy was excellent. The salad bar at Feeney's was a pleasant surprise that both I and my family enjoyed. If you're looking for a Greek restaurant, Feeney's is the place to go."
We found this resteraunt thank you to all of you yelpers!! My BF took me for my Bday and we loved it! The food was sooooo good and we were given a cozy little romantic booth. We also gave them a bday cake that they placed candles on and the singer came out with the waitress and sang to me over his microphone. Sounds embarressing but thankfully because of the way the cozy little booth was it was all good. The bathroom was nice and clean. The prices were really good and like I said the food tasted amazing. My only issue was the music was VERY loud so if your looking for a place to just sit and chat. This won't be the right venue for you!
"DO NOT USE HEARTH AND PATIO!!!! CHIMNEY FIRE NEW YEARS EVE. I have had my logs for less than two years. 1) purchase, glad to take my money 2) installation, two weeks late,and according to responders, improper flue installation, TWO times, causing heat to go up chimney (they didn't even use fire proof sealer) causing fire. When installer was ask about cleaning chimney, he said not necessary. Had them out to inspect for smell, then said i needed it cleaned, and more money. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO UNSATISFIED just trying to enjoy a fire."
"On our search for the best authentic Mexican restaurant, we tried Las Islitas.  It was very noisy inside, I could not hear my dinner partner across the table.  Mexican music played loudly over the speaker, and a juke box played in the back.\nChips were okay, the salsa was good.  We ordered the shrimp tacos and chili relleno.  The tacos were deep fried (not stated on the menu), and greasy.  They were more like an empanada.  They were plain and bland.  The relleno was greasy as well and soggy.  It also had very little flavor.  It was also somewhat pricey for a strip shopping center, \""dive\"".  We won't be back."
"Their soups are GREAT! The service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot. The employees are kind of a \""grunge\"" crowd. However, last time I went, I got food poisoning. I would say eat there, but the food is the only good part about it. Good selection of beer, wine...not at all."
"Went to the Warm Springs location for my birthday (5 yr in a row) was surprised with new menu.... got our dinners and was sadly disappointed sides were over cooked and over seasoned . The \""brisket\"" was cut into small strips like french fries . They got the wrong ribs for my plate and the burnt ends were fatty and not good at all. We have been fiercely loyal for 6 yrs but sad to say today was our last visit and we will not be recommending Memphis to anyone. Everytime we had guests come into town this is the place we always took them too but no longer it has become a place not to go. So sad I feel like we lost a friend today.\n\n\nPS. I heard they got a new manager and she isnt up to snuff .. really poor dining experience. Wait staff tried but you can feel how disgruntled they are and have had to deal with irate customers. I feel sorry for them."
"Bangkok Balcony is a nice spot, but it isn't the best Thai in town.  The tables are a little cramped, but if you're by the window you can enjoy the view of Forbes Ave.\n\nThe price is decent, but I don't think I've been able to get in and out in a decent amount of time.  Between waiting for a table and the slow orders expect to be there a while."
"Extremely disappointed and would not recommend consigning fairly new and nice furniture items.. I brought in 3 pieces of furniture that were purchased within a 2 year time period and were still in the store catalogs.  I gave them the receipts and they had priced them less than 1/2 of what they were purchased for and that was okay, but what disturbed me was, they were marked down within 2 weeks of being in the store and I was told that they had a lot of interest and it was priced to high.  The two desirable pieces sold as soon as they were marked down and the 3rd piece which was less desirable was never marked down ???.  I still can't figure that one out. When I questioned the man on the floor,  his response was we need to price that down too.  Very arrogant attitude and I learned my lesson the hard way.  There are many Consignment stores out there and they wait 60 days before they mark down an item and you split the purchase 50/50.  If it's a nice item, I'd go else where.."
This is the most dishonest company! \n\nThe  technician opened up my unit and put to wires together and shorted it out. \nHe thought I wouldn't notice but hard not to when the wires sparked.\nHe denied doing it but I saw I it myself.\nI was  confirmed with Nevada Power when they came.
"Came on a Saturday evening.  Got in line at 10:30pm or so with a group of 5 (3 guys, 2 girls) and got in within 15 minutes.  The line really does move fast!  So fast, in fact, one of our friends who had to run back to the room to drop something off (we were staying at the Encore) didn't make it back before we got in.\n\nWe all got the stamp and then headed back to our room for some drinking.  I waited in line with the 6th friend so she could get her stamp, just before 11pm at that point.  We moved through the line really quickly again, probably 10 minutes, got stamped and headed back to our room. Re-entry line is awesome. \n\nI think guys paid $30, but the girls and I were lucky to get passes for free.\n\nEven with a long line, the girls bathroom moves quickly too. Lots of stalls and ladies there to lead you to the next open stall. They are very efficient at XS!\n\nThe music was great and the dance floor was fantastic. Dancing essentially under the stars was a great experience.  I love the outdoor area, which is just brilliant.\n\nIf you're going to XS, just know what you're getting into and plan ahead. Do your research and don't be an idiot and show up at 1am, thinking you might not have to wait awhile.  People aren't going to be leaving the club that early, this is Vegas! Just commit to going to XS and get your dance on!"
I was passing through Phoenix when I was searching for an Indian restaurant and my GPS pointed me to this place. The ambiance is very ordinary and they could definitely do better job with it.  \n\nService was reasonably prompt. They didnt ask me for a spice level when they took my order. I found the food bland for my taste. Could have done with more spice and salt. The food is alright nothing out of the ordinary.
I used to go to Ingleside animal hospital for all my pets needs. I had a very sick kitty that they could not figure out what was wrong. The only option was exploratory surgery for an amount that was way out of my budget. I also didn't think my kitty would survive the surgery. They attempted to find every $!00 treatment they could over the course of several years. Never did figure out what ailed him. They got the money in the long run. Once my kitty needed some more antibiotics for an abscess that Dr. Serbin had already seen and prescribed for. The abscess came back. I had recently lost my car and my job and asked if they could just call a script in to a local pharmacy as i didn't have the $ for a cab ride or the visit. It had been 4 months since his last office visit and like i said they had seen this poor kitty dozens of times on deaths door over years. He told me it wasn't ethical to prescribe the meds that i needed to come in. I was irrate. I had just been in there for another cat 2 months prior and had a standing antibiotic script for him so I asked if they could call in the script for the other animal they had just seen. He told me that he wouldnt because he knew I would give it to the other animal.  I ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else. otherwise my poor cat would have went without. I wrote a letter to them of how upset i was and got no reply.\n\n A few years later after trying many other vets and the sick kitty had passed away the other kitty I had needed a dental cleaning. I had saved adamantly to acquire the funds to get it done over 2 years. (its very expensive. In light of my experiences there I trusted their competency with doing the dental surgery so I returned back money in hand over $400. My anger from previous grievances were furthest from my mind had just about forgotten and just wanted my cats teeth cleaned. On the day of the appt because of my cats age they did pre blood work for the surgery and it came back he was diabetic. I couldn't believe it i had another cat that was diabetic and this one didn't show any of the signs i was shocked so they ran some more tests and loaded me up with insulin and never cleaned his teeth. My bill was just about all of the $400 i had desperately saved. Every time i gave the cat insulin his sugar would crash. I ended up going to a different vet (BLUE CROSS animal hospital) who eventually did the surgery and said that his mouth was causing his diabetes and he just needed it done. I suspect  Ingleside purposely ran my bill up and didn't treat my animal because of past disputes. I have no proof but I will never pass on a chance to warn other cat owners to avoid them I will never return there and am so much happier with BCAC. I live in tempe now but will gladly drive to BCAC.
"Visited Arizona with a couple of architect friends, so the Phoneix Library had to be a stop :)  The outside of the building isn't nearly as impressive as the inside.  But wowie, when you're inside, it's like a whole other world.  The details and attention to spacing are amazing.  Not to mention it's a LEED certified building (green building) which is pretty cool.  If not to check out books, you gotta at least check out the building."
"went to drive thru, Smh. Horrible customer service. The girl made a rude comment after I changed the size of my blizzard. So rude!!! If you don't like your job. LEAVEEEE!"
"Definitely a little corny but it was a lot of fun! You have to remember it's not exactly like the TV version. My friends and I had a lot of fun even though we didn't get called up. The famous showcase round was by far the most ridiculous \""set up\"" ever. \nA cruise to Mexico\nA trip to Hawaii\n100 shares in stocks\n2012 Nissan.....the 1st person said $29,675, 2nd person said $33,000\n\nwait for it..............$14,000!!!! come on!! That's not even fair! Of course everyone would over bid if they value all those items for that price!"
"Bad food. Bad service. Bad drinks. I guess we caught our server on an off night, but the next day we ate here again after leaving the pool and the food was even worse than the night before."
"This museum in the Luxor is great for tourists who have never really seen the human body. They have audio tours but at an additional cost. All of the body parts are put in cases and they even have facts hung onto the wall. About halfway through a sign says \""This maybe inappropriate for children, you can continue or exit.\"" (Something like that) [example of the room: preserved fetuses] Not exactly sure where the exit leads you there as I've been through the room every time. The normal exit is where you have to return the audio remotes, you can give feedback on the museum, and there is a gift shop. (Items are quite expensive, $3.99 for a small eraser I believe yikes!) But in all this museum has exquisite models of the human body and can help you learn much about it. [Note:Small children maybe frightened. Not recommended for children under 8; if you are thinking of becoming a medical doctor and need to study, this is the place for you!)"
"I really wanted to like this place. The service is good and the ambiance was great, but the food was lacking. After reading about it, me and the boys decided we had to try the Chicken Fried Lobster. What's the worse that could happen? Well to answer that, no seasoning. This was a nice piece of 8 ounce lobster pan fried in bread crumbs, no salt, no pepper, no garlic, no basil, nothing (at least you can't taste any seasoning). They serve it with warm drawn butter and a horrible orange colored sauce. When you think Chicken Fried you think of big flavor and this missed the mark. This could be a great dish, but it just isn't here. I sprinkled salt and pepper on it, but it only helped a little. The sauce they serve with it is bad. I did get an awesome loaded baked potato, but that's not what I came for. Lobster bisques (decent, but needed more lobster), salads, and the entr\u00e9es, were about $250 before tip (no wine). We should have hopped a cab to DelFrisco's, Kraftsteak, Gallagher's, or just walked and tried Vic & Anthony's. I tried to give the old steakhouse a run, but I will not return unless it's to take the elevator ride, have a drink and get a great view of the city with someone who has never been to Vegas."
"I come to Brillo Box all the time. My friend, who is 28 and us from Turkey was not let in tonight... For dinner and drinks. The guy working the door needs an attitude adjustment and just because a place has been raided in the past, does not mean you don't act like a civilized human being. A Turkish ID that says 28... Should be enough. Shame on you Brillo Box. I am done with you and your awesome food. Get a new bouncer!!!!"
"Average food, VERY limited delivery area, and abrupt customer service.  Very meh."
Great place to get cold drinks and really good bar food! Bartenders are amazing and always friendly! Plenty of TV's to catch any game you wish! Can't go wrong here!
"The best tacos in the city, amazing veggies, and indescribably great salsas. The tacos are like tapas, so you need to order two or three, but they are reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff with great art to view while waiting for your order."
"Let me start this review by saying that you don't have to be Asian to shop here! A few of my coworkers asked me if I can get some things for them. I asked them why couldn't they get it themselves? They replied with \""We are not Asian and they might treat us differently\"". I should of been offended right? Nope. Instead I said, \""They will only treat you different if you act like jerks so don't be one and you'll be ok.\""\n\nSeafood City is similar to 99 Ranch but caters more to the Filipino population. If you have ever eaten at a Filipino restaurant, this is where you will find most if not all the ingredients in all the dishes you eat. \n\nI come here for all sorts of things like different flavored chips, nuts, biscuits, crackers, etc. Drinks like coconut juice. mango juice, calamansi juice, etc. \n\nBasically, a lot of items you just cant find at your basic Smith's or Albertsons. What is also great is the location of this place. If you get hungry there is a Chow King and a Jollibee just right in front where you enter.\n\nThe layout of their place is nice also. All the way to the right you have all your vegetables. All the way to the back you have all your refrigerated items. All the way to the left are all the seafood/meat items along with the frozen section. In between you have all the aisles with all the little things I mentioned in my 3rd paragraph.\n\nService is actually above average. They usually have enough people on registers so that long lines are virtually non existent. Most of the time each cashier has their own assistant that bags all the merchandise you just bought. \n\nSo for those non Asians, just relax and shop just like you would at any other supermarket. Sometimes its ok to shop somewhere different. You never know, you just might find something you really like here."
"FYI - if you plan to rent a car, allow extra time.  All of the car rental agencies are located in a separate terminal.  There's just one big bus to hop onto.  In light of the new TSA regs, they have little baggies for you to put your gels into [or lip glosses in my case].  Here's the interesting thing....At PHX they're drawstring... LAX has totally different bags....draw your own conclusions.....\n\n\nETA.  GGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....I had to update this review.  The only reason it's not one star is because my bag showed up....EVENTUALLY.  I recently had to check a bag from Phoenix to Oakland, because it takes more than a quart size bag of liquids and gels to maintain the Rhubarb for a week.  Somehow, my bag and I did not end up on the same flight.  They found it within 24 hours of me getting home.  But it was a LONG 24 hours, and they just weren't very nice about the whole thing.  At one point this chick asked what was in my bag....um, I don't know.  I told her I did not make a list because I did  not anticipate the neanderthals at PHX would lose my beloved Samsonite wheeley.  When she asked me what type of bag it was, I said, do you want a serial number????  \n\nOK, end rant.  let's hope they do better the next time."
"I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong. The new quote was DOUBLE what I was quoted the day before! Not only was I disappointed about the price, but the sale associate was rude and didn't care about what had happened. I will never shop at Lens Crafters ever again. What a horrible experience! I also came in many times before and the employees never helped me. They were just sitting down doing nothing. I honestly don't know how they are able to stay in business if they don't help customers or at least ask."
Ordered the pepper tofu and was expecting it to be a nice pepper sauce!!! All we got was tofu in pepper with no salt !!! Could not eat it with rice. Had to ask for sauces and fix it on the table. Thanks but I can eat at home if I need to cook my own food !
"Excellent food, with horrific service. Came here with a couple friends and my boyfriend for lunch one Sat. Like a previous review stated, the hostess was very gracious and kind, but that's where it stops. Our service was very shotty. Our server seemed to have absolutely no interest on giving us good service since we weren't dropping hundreds on lunch buying bottle waters or drinking wine or alcohol. Ordered and Iced tea and not once did anybody offer a refill for my tea. I shouldn't have to wave you down to refill my ice tea. 2 of my friends wanted to share an appetizer and an entree and was straight up told by our server that it wasn't allowed. Our server was very rude. He only came to our table to take our order and drop off our check. This place seemed so promising but due to the service of one server, this place came off very pretentious. Maybe if the staff/server spent less time on their iPhones and more time taking care of their guests,  I could give this place another try next time I was in Vegas. But I can assure u I will NEVER go or suggest this place ever again. U shouldn't leave feeling like u were looked down upon when you was choose to spend my hard earned money on the establishment."
"As an avid coffee fan, I have to say that Caribou has won me over. They have free Wi-Fi, which is great if you find yourself in the area and you need to do some work via computer. When you walk in the door, you feel like you've left the Southside and entered a cozy ski lodge. They even have a fireplace surrounded by big, comfy chairs -definitely a plus when you're looking for a place to relax and sip on some espresso. \n\nOne of the cool things about Caribou is that it has a wider variety of menu items than your typical coffee shop. The oatmeal (try their Blueberry Almond flavor, so good!), breakfast sandwiches and snacks are much better than what you can get at your local Starbucks. If you're not a coffee person, Caribou also has some really good flavored teas. Overall, a great place to get your caffeine fix."
"I have visited on a couple occasions and really enjoyed it each time. Our last visit was with some family and friends in town visiting and everyone left more than satisfied. \n\nIf you're looking for unique, well-made cocktails then this is a must visit. They have broken down the various drinks by historical time period and the menu provides a little description of how the drink got its name. \n\nAlmost everyone took advantage of the happy hour, half price steaks. One of the filets was a bit under-cooked, but for the most part they were spot on. All the sides we ordered were great, but the truffle mac and cheese was a table favorite. I can't say enough about the \""Farmer\"" flat bread pizza - bacon, spinach, and a cracked egg. This is something you just have to try in order to understand how delicious it really is. \n\nDessert was almost certainly out of the question until the server started to describe them. We ordered their version of the pizooki as well as the homemade doughnuts. The entire table thought they had died and gone to heaven after finishing these desserts. Save room!\n\nAnother satisfying and enjoyable experience. Great food, solid drinks and a unique atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy Strip."
"I stayed here on a business trip due to the property's proximity to the Sands Expo and the other good hotels nearby were sold out already.\n\nPros:\n-close to sands expo\n-room was clean\n\nCons:\n-HORRIBLE reception desk service (slow, long waits)\n-room smelled like total smoke even though it was a non smoking room\n-no wifi\n-bad bathroom toiletries (no conditioner!)\n-very confusing to navigate the layout. I got lost several times \n-room was either freezing, or hot and stuffy\n\nAll in all, I would not stay there again."
"I don't want to repeat what everyone else has said. It really is a fantastic meal. Especially if you're out celebrating something special or romantic. The artistic treehouse canopy is lovely to sit under. The service is phenomenal and thoughtful (when I said I was already getting full after my appetizer, the waiter offered to make my scallops entree an appetizer portion). The gorgonzola mac n cheese is out of this world. The brussel sprouts are excellent. The scallops amazing. The oysters rockefeller were the best I've ever tasted. The Chilean Sea bass also was the best I've ever tasted (my bf had that... I tasted it). Then the warm butter cake... Cuh-ray-zee!!! So unbelievably good. My eyes went all googly and I nearly floated away. And the portions are generous so unless you're like us and were just curious to try many different things, don't order too much. It will be enough."
"To be honest I was fairly disappointed with Aribas. People had given me mixed reviews prior to me going there and it seemed either people really liked it or weren't impressed at all; and upon going there myself I could see why. At first I was shocked and ecstatic by their dollar margarita special during happy hour, however when we got our drinks you could barely taste any tequila (although they were only a dollar, it literally felt like I was drinking flavored water). The chips and salsa at the table were awesome (probably the best part of eating there). I ordered enchiladas which were pretty undercooked and didn't really have much flavor outside of the melted cheese. My friends got the spicy chicken entree and a chimichanga. The spicy chicken was ridiculously spicy and not very good; the chimichanga was pretty good however but nothing special. Out waitress seemed very aloof the whole time we were there and the one thing that bothered me the most was a small side of sour cream was $1.99!!!!! despite the meals being pricey to begin with."
This is the place that first started serving fried Oreos and Twinkies in Las Vegas. This is also the place that has scantily clad women in front handing out beads. This is a slot machine only type of casino that we walked in and out of because it smelled of the same skanky oil it smelled like when I was last here about 3.5 years ago.
"Love this service.   I use it about once a month to PHX and often on the other end of my flights too if I am not renting a car.   Always on time, always courteous.   I use them for business trips mostly, easy online booking even for same day a couple hours in advance.   If I need them sooner than that I usually call...have never had an issue."
"I am a loyal Fry's shopper; however, today I became very disappointed! I was near 7th and Bell and needed just a couple of items, so I swung in here. It took me over 5 minutes to find the Cheese! I was so frustrated by the layout of this store, I went towards the big DAIRY sign, but apparently cheese is no longer catergorized as such. I can understand deviation, but toys in the middle and end-cap refriderators in odd ball sections...it just was way to difficult to find anything! They need to look at this layout and come up with something more convient for shoppers."
Terribly long wait. It's like they didn't know that anyone was coming to Las Vegas today. They seemed to have more employees than people waiting in line as they were doing a shift change that took about 1 hour.  Someone else commented that it was like the Post Office and they were exactly right.  They just don't give a damn.  Rent somewhere else no matter how much it costs!
"This stadium is like a giant UFO landing on an open field. A total Eye Sore. Plus the Team has been a total underachiever. But these aren't the only reasons I am completely down w/ the the stadium. First off, the prices of the tickets are awful. The stadium itself is designed horribly to keep the fans as far away from the field that even w/ binoculars you miss the action. But paying 50+ for 2nd tier and nosebleeds... that's outragous. \n\nThen there is the location. With all the open space you would think that they would design proper parking and roads. Getting to and from the stadium takes 1 hour to reach the freeway 1 mile away. The parking situation is just stupid bad. \n\nLastly there is the staff/organization. The NFL implimented a new bag rule and the security at the gates were rude and ignorant of the rules. I had a small camera bag. I was told to throw it away or take it back to the car. No where around were the rules associated w/ the new bag rule. just this rude, bored bouncer. After throwing it away I found out that bags 4.5 x 6.5 are acceptable. My camera bag was 3x6. Too late, to do anything about it. \n\nGiven the problems in parking, staff and over charging I would rather go to Zipps and enjoy the game there. A much better food selection and nicer on the wallet."
"This review is based on my experience sitting outside.  In the summer, as many others do, I enjoy sitting outside to meet others and have great coffee.\nUnfortunately, the majority of the tables outside of Cafe Kopi allow smoking, even though many of these tables are less than 15 feet from the door.  I have been sitting here for an hour and a half and I have not been able to enjoy this for more than five minutes, as the stream of smoking is constant.\n\nI would think that in this day and age, cafes would discourage smoking so as not to harm the health of other guests.\n\nThis is intolerable, and I won't be back to sit outside.\n\nCoffe is good, but my lungs are worth more."
"The BEST Thai food that I've ever had!\n\nWe're really, really picky about our Thai food and Basil 'n Lime is as authentic as they come.  The pad thai (both chicken and tofu) are fabulous, as are their spring rolls, and red curry.  Just a few of our favorites!\n\nThe staff is also amazing....well mannered, courteous and always one step ahead of you.  What always amazes me is that whether or not my husband is with me, one waiter always remembers that I need a pad thai with chicken done spicy to go.  I never have to remember...he'll always ask!   And when I arrive before my take out's ready, they're always there with a glass of ice water and a kind smile.  \n\nLove, love, LOVE this place!  Even though we're moving across town next month we plan to make the trek back to their restaurant often."
"I've been here now about 5-6 times now and am finally getting to post a review. So here's my feedback on specific items:\n\n1) AYCE: I did this for lunch the first time I came so that I could test out several rolls without totally breaking the wallet (which, if you order more than 2-3 a la carte, is always way more than just shelling out for AYCE). I wish I could remember the names but one in particular stood out, which is the roll with the deep fried unagi on top. That one totally blew my wig back. I like mostly rolls that aren't all raw and one thing I like about this place is that in my mind it truly reflects the 808 \""taste\"" - most on the sweet side (most if not all their rolls come with eel sauce drizzled on them) and in the a la carte non-sushi items, GENEROUS PORTIONS. \n\nDownside: If I had anything to gripe about in flavor it would be that they almost put TOO much eel sauce on their non-raw rolls which, from me, is something. I'm the girl who usually requests extra eel sauce on the side and more of the sweet pickled ginger, geez. Some might have to request \""light\"" sauce. \n\nI also noticed their rolls are smaller but \""longer\"" if that makes any sense, and this is something I LOVE. Less rice too. I hate it when they roll them so wide and tall that you look like you're having a painful experience when widening your jaw just to eat a slice. I mean, you can always order more!!!\n\n2) MOCHIKO CHICKEN: I will confess that I came twice in one week just to eat this manna from heaven. I'd never had it before so was intrigued enough to order it and it's a cross between teriyaki (it being marinated chicken thighs in a sweet soy sauce) and chicken katsu (being fried crisp). The coating isn't panko but mochiko (sticky rice flour) which gives it this crazy crisp coating that STAYS crisp even through the next day (I speak from experience). They slice it up nicely for you. Very, very well done and very delicous and they always serve it so piping hot that steam is still rising from the sliced crust. I can't go back to Katsu after having this!!!\n\n3) KATSU CHICKEN: Massive portions, crispy crust, VERY tender and juicy chicken, practically falls aparts as you try to pick it up with chopsticks. Not as much a fan of their katsu sauce - which was a dark, soy-based gingery sauce. While it was nice that they tried to tailor their sauce to their restaurant I would have much preferred the generic sweet-slightly-sour reddish-orange-brown sauce that usually accompanies katsu chicken which helps cuts through the fried flavor.\n\n3) BENTO BOX COMBINATION MEAL- OK, so I tried one day for lunch their \""combination special\"" which I think for around $14-$15 offered \""2 choices\"" from a whole selection of stuff. They offer one selection for slight cheaper and three selections if you want more. I picked the mochiko chicken and katsu chicken thinking for a dainty Japanese bento box, would be tiny servings. Hellllll noooo.... 808 Hawaiian sensibility came busting out when the waiter came back struggling with my obscenely loaded bento box. 2 massive sliced-up portions of mochiko chicken and 2 massive portions of the katsu, rice scoop, gingery green salad, soup, steamed edamame, PLUS dessert of your choice (I chose mango mochi ice cream, which was delish). I waved the waiter over to ask for a box afterwards and upon seeing my bento box, joked he could have resold my plate \""as is\"" because it looked hardly touched. More leftovers for lunch for me! I basically got 3 lunches for $15.\n\n4) SERVICE/ PRICING: I am extremely happy with the pricing, I find them competitive, fair and they offer good value for the price. Service has always been stellar when I was there with water always being topped up and multiple 'how you doing?' checks from the staff.\n\nI'll definitely continue to come here and greatly recommend this place for people like me who love the Hawaiian flavor focus, portions, and laid back feel."
"Whenever I'm in the mood for a good, solid burger I head over to Zinburger at Biltmore Fashion Park. I like how simple the menu is so it is not too overwhelming, yet there is something for everyone. I am a little obsessed with their zucchini fries, although I do wish they came out with my burger instead of before. The burgers are always good and they're big enough to share if you're not too hungry. I always say I'm going to try one of their shakes or pies for dessert, but I'm always too full from the burger and fries. Maybe next time. :)"
"Are you grooming your child to become an over pampered trophy wife that has a penance for pink and rhinestones? You are? Well have I got the place for you! Kid's Kastle will ensure that your daughter expects to wear only $20 dollar fake rhinestone emblazoned headbands, $60 dollar tutus, or carry around her very own $100 dollar Hello Kitty suitcase. You can even buy her a set of press on nails that would make a Vegas stripper proud for around $15 bucks. I ensure you they will AT LEAST last until you make it out the Forum Shops!"
"I can't even tell you how wonderful the peruvian cuisine is here. Actually, I can. I went to this place because I live very close by. I didn't expect much when walking in. Decor is cool, but it was not busy at all which worried me. We asked the waiter what his fave dish was and he said the Lomo Saltado. I ordered it and fell in love the minute the food touched my lips. It's quality beef strips, sauteed with white onions and sliced tomoatoes. It is cooked in a vinegar/beer marinade and tossed with french fries. My husband got the Milanesa. It is breaded steak with a side of a beautiful pesto pasta. We haven't tried any seafood here but that happens to be one of their specialties. This place is perfect for a date night, or bringing family to for a night of great food."
Ambiance: Excellent\nRoom: Excellent\nService/Concierge: Excellent\nParking: Reasonable\nLocation: Excellent\nOne can get a good price for this place if planning properly. The location is good but could be better its a short  walk to the main shopping area and restaurants area. There is plenty of parking and the service is great as always with the Delta Chain of hotels. You can park on the street if you want but I would be wary considering what I have seen in Montreal Downtown. We were upgraded to the Signature Club room which allows you access to the Signature Lounge.Continental breakfast and complimentary hors d'oeuvre are served in the Lounge. Great for someone like me who wants a quick coffee fix. Being a Delta Hotel fan I would recommend it any day. This hotel can get busy and sometimes you have a rowdy crowd so I would recommend a higher floor if you can manage it.
"OK. I'm calling this one. Either this restaurant has perpetrated one of the most successful internet review scams in history or I visited during an epic meltdown in the kitchen. As repeatedly hyped by reviewer after reviewer, I was expecting a well above average pizza comparable to those in New York. Instead, I was shocked to be served the worst pizza in my life.  Honestly, my high school cafeteria's had more flavor. The bland crust had ok texture, but when topped by a scant amount of what tasted like canned tomato sauce and packaged mozzarella, I could barely get through it. And how did they find utterly flavorless basil? I'll never know. The fact that an amazing pizzeria (Mama Mia's on Indian School) exists just a couple miles away makes me sick that I wasted my time and money at this place. I visited the Town & Country location FYI. Won't be back. Ever."
Really nice Steakhouse. The food was absolutely fine and the stuff very friendly. We will come back as soon we are back in Montreal!
"Came here to eat today as my boss and 2 coworkers wanted to. I know People love this place, I am just not a fan, even though I want to be as I understand it is a local business. \n\nI like the decor as the owners invite customers to bring in 8x10 photos of their dogs and they display the photos on the walls around the restaurant. The also serve free peanuts, they put in dog bowls and they let you toss the shells on the floor. \n\nThe service has always been friendly and today was no exception. \n\nI knew going in I was going to ask the server for a recommendation. She said without hesitation the burgers were delicious. Sounded great, so I ordered a teryaki burger, served with mayo, pineapple, swiss & teryaki sauce. 35 minutes later our party got our food including my burger. Not sure what was the hold up as we were among maybe 10 other customers in the restaurant at lunch time. \n\nI took a bite of the burger and could instantly tell the bun on the burger was at least day old, the meat had no flavor and clearly was previously frozen. I did let the server know I did not like my burger and she took it off the bill without making me feel bad about not liking it. \n\nSo I did not get lunch today, but those who know me would say I could stand to miss a meal or two. Maybe next time I will just drink at the bar and eat free peanuts."
"We tried Egg & I on a recent trip working in Vegas. It's hard to find good breakfasts, and the reviews here made me think we found the holy grail of breakfast spots! The reality: not so good.\n\nI had a benedict. I asked for the eggs medium hard, and they came out essentially hardboiled (I am not holding that against them), but worse, the hollandaise was pretty awful. Sort of an off, slightly grainy texture, no lemon to cut the richness, just unappetizing. Potatoes seemed too regular, like processed frozen potatoes. \n\nOn the upside, I tried one of the banana nut muffins, and it was pretty good. The staff was wonderful--really nice, helpful, on point. \n\nIf only the food had lived up to them....."
"Really good Ahi Tuna steak, especially if you're drunk and need something to even out the alcohol. Servers are nice and quick."
"Tried this place out on a Saturday night: had the sisay (a crispy pork with onions and green chillies) and spare ribs, and it was really good food.  You can taste the freshness of the ingredients, and it was prepared quickly by the waiter that was also the cook.  We were the only people in there, although several people came through for to-go orders.  Will definitely try their breakfast buffet some Sunday."
"I have to say that I was pretty intimidated to try Cartel about a year and a half ago - simply based on poor service reviews and threats of hipster judgment.\n\nWhen I want coffee, its because I'm beastly. I just woke up, I'm not looking like the hottest/hippest/nicest person in Tempe. I mean, I never look like that but when I NEED coffee, I need to dose myself in a safe and secure environment.\n\nSo I went to Cartel expecting the worst, I ordered Iced Toddy. To keep my order neutral and cheap. It was okay. Pretty f-ing good in comparison to xtreme bean, my only other Toddy experience. I branched out into soy Lattes because I like to get some protein in the morning. I know....latte for breakfast - aren't I a pillar of health?\n\nNO ONE judged me when I would order my soy latte with sugar-free vanilla in it. NO ONE. I've gotten some jokes about it, but who gives a fuck? It's $4.50 - I'm being a yuppie suburban bore when I order it and I know it and I don't give a shit if they know it. I love them for keeping me in check anyways. How is a kid from Tempe supposed to know anything about coffee? That's not my business. As the customer, it's our business to try new things as suggested by the people who's life's work is coffee.\n\nSo I tried an americano by suggestion. Its DELICIOUS. GET ONE. Iced/Hot, whatthefuckeverjustgetone. I go here for an americano EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE except when I am out of town and I bemoan the lack of Cartel even when I'm in Los Angeles (Mighty City of Intelligentsia). Which brings me to another point, the LINES.\n\nIf you are looking for a McLatte, they exist. It's called McDonalds. They are everywhere. Cartel is not a run in/run out kind of place. They are offering a luxury item as well as an experience. You wouldn't go to a spa and bitch about your facial taking too long. If you want to see lines, go to Intelligentsia during the midday rush and you will immediately appreciate what Cartel is doing.\n\nFor serving the entire ASU community with outstanding coffee, 20 minutes sounds about right. For a drink that is delicately crafted from bean to cup, $2.50-$4.50 is just right. For a locally owned company successfully competing with corporate giants, you might as well just go and give a deserving shop your money. \n\nAnd if you are nervous about being judged by the \""hip\"" kids who look like they smelled a fart, recognize that they are only posing with their macbooks and modern literature and are too vain to break character. \nAnd if you are nervous about being judged by the baristas, try SMILING at the people who are SERVING you - because you remember how hard it was to deal with customers before you got your middle management salaried job, right?\n\nI love you, Cartel."
"Pediped shoes are awesome! I'm going to be sad when my daughter grows out of them. I was so excited when they opened the corporate store. They have a wide selection, which other stores did not. You can even buy online & pick up in the store"
"If you like mediocre food, slow service (like really, really slow), and indifferent food servers, then this is the place for you.  Oh, did I mention they are also way over-priced?"
"So, I went to Buca di Beppo a couple of months ago as I was in P-burgh for a meeting.  I hadn't eaten since the morning and was very hungry and thought I would drop in for an early dinner.  Bad idea.\n\nI came in alone and not with a group and I came in early.  Not really their target demographic; however, they had no idea what to do with me.  So what did they do with me?  The put me in some back room near a kitchen.  Just me, some gangster memorabilia, big band music... and an empty room near the kitchen.  I eventually found a server and told him that I would eat at the bar, you know, where there are other people...\n\nThey let me order off the lunch menu, that was nice, so I ordered a lunch portion spaghetti.  Another bad idea.  The spaghetti sauce was terrible, tasted like catsup, the pasta was \""old\"" and seemed like it had been in the refrigerator for a couple of days and the meatball tasted like they walked over to McDonalds and asked for some hamburger meat.\n\nI realize that Buca really isn't structured to serve the one-man early-dinner customer.  And that is another drawback.  The place is located in a business center area.  They need to know who their potential customers are.\n\nThe Station Square location is kind of odd, it is tucked in by the river between the tunnels.  However, just walk across that cool bridge and find a local place across the river in the down town area.  Avoid Buca unless you are with a big group and want a pasta-heavy meal.  Actually, there are Italian restaurants across the river or further up Carson.  Just avoid Buca.\n\nNot going back to Buca, in any city.\n\nAside, P-burgh is a cool town and I can't wait for my next trip back."
"4 stars food\n0 stars service, it was totally abysmal this time.  what up with that?  the girl at the front was a total you know what.  anyway...its a good thing the whole food experience saved the day."
"The bomb- awesome- just like the Beverly Hills place.\nNot only is the food amazing- but they actually used alcohol\nin there drinks  (unlike many places in Vegas)\nWe went on a Thursday night- and the eye candy of \""available\""\nwomen waiting for clients was mind boggling.  \nAll the senses my senses were tickled at dinner."
"I've been to Mineo's a few times, and each time I experienced the same problems that others have mentioned here.  1) There is TOO MUCH cheese, so much that all the cheese comes off the pizza when I bite into it.  This should not happen.  2) The pizza is way too hot, and since I refuse to sit there for an hour waiting for it to cool off, I always end up burning my mouth and fingers.  Not pleasant.  And the cheese issue is worse when it gets cold, so this is quite a dilemma.  3) The staff isn't very friendly, although I've noticed this isn't exclusive to Mineo's.  A lot of the restaurants in Squirrel Hill seem to have this problem.\n\nThat said, their sauce is good and the crust is decent.  Last time I was there, I ended up taking off most of the cheese and just eating the crust with sauce on it.\n\nI realize this review reads like I hate Mineo's, which is not the case.  It's passable pizza, and good if you are very hungry and don't feel like weighing the pros and cons of each pizza place in Squirrel Hill.  I still haven't been to all of them, so I'm not an expert, but I do know that Mineo's is far from the best."
"I don't normally review chain places anymore but I'll say this -- this Taco Bell isn't that good as far as Taco Bells go. I don't know why but some ingredients -- especially anything with rice -- tastes awful. I don't know if the Taco Bell/KFC's use a different ingredient base but I can't believe how bad things like the Cheesy Bean and Rice burrito taste. Other than that, it's Taco Bell..what's to say?"
"My boyfriend and I went to Vegas this Labor Day weekend.  One of the places I wanted to visit was Wazuzu.  I knew Chef Jet from LA and love his cooking so I made sure to visit his restaurant.  \n\nWe checked out the restaurant Friday afternoon and there were maybe 3 couples there which was expected from reading the reviews.  We decided to go there Saturday evening.  It was packed.  We waited maybe 10 minutes for our table.  \n\nWe had the Sashimi Platter, Roti Panang, Crispy Fish with Thai Herbs, and Thai Spicy Basil Stir-Fry (all recommended by Chef Jet).  We ordered all but the sashimi with a spicy level of 5.  I must admit... our meal was delicious!  So it was pricey... big deal... we were in Vegas!  Btw, my boyfriend is Thai and if he approves, well... this restaurant is worth returning to.\n\nThe decor was nice.  Loved the \""crystal\"" dragon and the \""metal\"" dragons surrounded by roses.\n\nService overall was great.  We didn't have to wait long for our dishes to come out.  Chef Jet came out and chatted with us.  Even took a picture with him.\n\nBottom line... We're definitely going back!"
"Took wife to Il Vino for her birthday. Atmosphere was decent for a casino restaurant. Our waiter, Zach, was attentive but not overbearing. I had lasagna and wife had manicotti. Both were very good. Nice size portions that we had to pack to take home since we could not eat it all. Excellent bread sticks. The moscato wine was superb.  Very affordable dinner as well."
"Ryan J brought me out here and, yes, I brought my A game--went ahead and ordered the Bear: peanut butter, cracker jacks, bacon, gouda and BBQ sauce. It was state-fair-what-did-I-Just-Do? awesome. So good. \n\nThe carneys selling overpriced knitting nearby were odd--but we liked the lamps the guys recreating Mad Men were pimping out there.\n\nI don't know anything about these Short Leash Dogs people--but they clearly have something dialed in. The Bear dog was part of some contest put on by the Arizona Diamondbacks. They won, so now it's become a big deal for them.\n\nRyan J got a different dog. And as he reviewed nearly two years ago: you gotta \""unleash your hot dog inhibitions\"" to get into this place.\n\nWho has hot dog inhibitions? Dumb people, that's who."
"i love asian food- i also love spicy food and decent portions and thai hut gives me all of that.  the service is excellent and the drunken noodles with tofu are amazing. i get it thai hot and it is plenty spicy! i've also had their green curry, which was excellent. there are a few places in tempe that i like better, but it's the best in central phoenix, imo"
"I love El Pollo Loco but this location SUCKS!! The guy in front of me was ordering catering and the girl was rude and said for him to hold on. She went to the back and came back up front taking crap about the girl she just went to the back to talk to. When we got up to the counter a new girl was taking our order. Her name was Cecy. She had her phone on the counter and was checking her Facebook as we were giving her our order. I caught her eye and gave her a \""seriously?\"" look but that didn't stop her from cruising along her social media quest. She called our name for food and informed us that what I ordered they didn't have. She asked me what else I want. I ordered what I didn't want. We finally got our order. The food was terrible. The tortillas were really stale. Nasty! I will never go back to this location again."
"I am not embarrassed to say I LOVE buffets. I am, however, embarrassed to write the review of this one.  I saw this buffet on a few top ten lists, all of which praised it for being far more affordable than the other top-notch Vegas buffets.  \nMy experience was laughably bad.\nFirst, it's only $10 cheaper than some of the best buffets in Vegas (Bellagio may be my fave) at $27, and the experience is night and day.\nMuch of the food was mislabeled or had no name cards at all, and when I'd mention that fact to the cooks behind the counter, they literally shrugged.  I asked to move to a table near an outlet so I could charge my phone, and the waiter told me \""no one will help you there\"", so I sat 15 feet from where they sat me... He walked past me 10 times and never got me a drink or said another word to me.\nThe food was just OK. Not as big a selection as the Rio or Wynn, and while I'm not big on shellfish and sea food, I'd say that was the strength of this buffet. The dessert selection was huge, but much lower-quality than any of the top-notch buffets.\nI ended up eating a make-your-own fajita, which is a bad sign. There are so many better choices, avoid this one."
So I am really at a loss for the how the reviews for this place are any good.  I went due to a snag and save deal I got online and am grateful for it because I still spent too much money.\n\nFirst I got a salad and it had stale croutons and really no flavor.  Then came the pizza.  I got the Boarder Runner pie and it had premade crust and just generic low quality toppings.  I just don't get the idea of the restaurant and really wish they cared more about the product they put on the table.
"This place is great! Nice location and great food. I sat outside and enjoyed the weather and the scenery. \n\nNormally when I eat, I seem to end up eating my meat first and veggies/sides last. Well this was a first. The creamed potatoes and cabbage were the two best things on my plate! They were finished before anything. The mac and cheese was good also. The fried chicken was not the best I've ever had, but definitely not bad. \n\nThe only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the cornbread. Weird, especially since they have a bakery attached, but the cornbread was not good at all. One bite, and I placed it on the side, and never touched it.\n\nI also had the cheese plate appetizer which was delicious."
"I really don't like this place. Their service is so terrible. They always give me an attitude, and they're oh so rude. The only reason I come here is my friends like some of their drinks. I don't want to be a picky snob and insist we go somewhere else. I'll never have a day where I'll be like, \""hey, let's go to tea station!\"" Icy juicy will provide a much better service."
"i'm not an expert on filipino food, but out of the 3 filipino restaurants i've tried (others nanay gloria, pinay pinoy)...goldilocks has to be the worst...\n\ni came here for lunch and my friend and i tried about  8 dishes (taro leaves in coconut milk, fried rice with shrimp paste, some type of noodle soup, pancit...and a few others i can't remember)...they all lacked the homemade touch of nanay gloria...the only dish i liked was the lechon which came with a sweet, slightly tart dipping sauce.  i also ordered the calamansi drink...it was overly sweet and artificial tasting...\n\nthere is a large selection of baked goods...but nothing that looked very unique or tasty...\n\ni guess it's back to nanay..."
"It's amazing that no matter what me and my family do we can't walk out the door for no less than $30. The food is good , not great. The new cost cutting measures include the servers putting ALL ICE in your cups and 10% soda , and putting a layer of cheese so thin on the pizzas that it's stupid. New employees , same complete idiot type. A girl who came to our table on the same night , served us 2 different pizzas that we didn't order. Then she seemed like she was \""disrespected\"" when we pointed out that the pizza's weren't the ones we ordered. Just save your money. I agree with tabatha , I've lost about 20 pounds since I've stopped eating at major food chains that have taken gross amounts of cost cutting. There's more cheese on the pizzas from the taco bell menus that have pizza hut. Seriously! you get more cheese on that little pre made pizza that comes from the PH factory that what they put on the pizzas when they're making them \""fresh\"". Last one I had smelt like corn chips at this location.\n\nsave your money."
"My wife and I ate here after reading the high reviews and were REALLY disappointed. We visited on a rainy day and they had buckets all over the restaurant to catch water from the leaking roof, and the bathroom was even worse. I've seen cleaner dive bar bathrooms. Serious. Aside from the buckets and bathroom, the food was mediocre at BEST. The sauces tasted like they came out of a can and the egg drop soup was terrible! We won't be back."
"Deelish BBQ. If you are craving tasty cooked meat, and sides of comfort, go here. Lucille's has a lively atmosphere and an extensive menu. Their location is convenient."
"The \""new\"" Penguin Drive In leaves a lot to be desired. The server got our order wrong twice (on a slow Thursday night) and the food was cold and bland. No more crispy tater tots, greasy buns, or hot, juicy, and delicious burgers. A sad, sad, sad experience."
"I've probably been here around ten times, but haven't reviewed this spot!  Okay, here's my two cents:\n\nThe fact that it's been years and it's still popular does prove that it's still a happening spot.  When you have a good promoter and an even ratio, girls and guys get in for free, and girls have been getting free open bar for an hour (just go to the less popular bar areas to load up on drinks for the boys in your group, too!).\n\nThe bathrooms upstairs are interesting though annoying at times...the main dance floor is super tiny which is a mistake on their part...but the beach upstairs (which isn't always open) is beautiful and more spacious.\n\nBut the best part of all is that I did meet my boo here.  So despite the common notion that you can't find any quality men/women in the clubs...well, I guess we found love in a hopeless place (or am I just encouraging exceptions over rules?)."
"When it comes to pizza delivery, flip a coin, because your experience will change daily.  Overall, I'm not disappointed.  It has to be pretty bad. Pizza is hard to screw up, because even overcooked is really extra crispy lol, so I don't mind. Unless my pizza is charcoal, or missing ingredients, I'm happy.\n\nDelivery is prompt and food is tasty.  Happy to have a gluten free option too."
"Brought a friend to this store to ship a pkg to her daughter for her birthday.  The counter person, Bill, would not ship her pkg because she could not read and verify the address that he had on his printout.  My friend told him that she could not read it, not that she wouldn't, but she could not.  She had the address on the pkg, but he needed her to look at his printout and verify the address. He told her that he would not ship the pkg unless she did this.  My friend cannot because she is legally blind.  He would not help her and refused to send the pkg."
"We went here a couple days ago and I wasn't impressed. I thought it was a nicer restaurant, but it ended up being like a fast food restaurant. We called in an order and asked for Mongolian beef and a separate order of fried rice. When we went to go pick up the order, he said there was 2 scoops of fried rice inside that came with the meal. Thank goodness we ordered egg rolls and some crab ragoon (which were good)  because if we only had a scoop of rice and the small portion of Mongolian beef we would of not been satisfied. I probably would not recommend going here again."
"Just a update that this one is fairly consistent and I've had few issues over the years. Even on a \""off\"" day it's never bad, just maybe a tad dry/salty/greasier than I like. \n\nI mostly order the same things when I go here. I get the California burrito (carne asada, pico, cheese, potatoes), carnitas burrito, super nachos, breakfast burrito, chicken taquitos or chorizo plate. I have delved off before, but I feel these are the better things to order so I stick with it.  The only thing I avoid though is shredded chicken here - I'm not a fan of it shredded and then sitting in a sort've sauce. I prefer grilled and diced style chicken at other places. \n\nI always have found it amusing that somehow this is the unofficial hangout for teens who just got their cars. I guess there's not much up here they're allowed late-ish. \n\n24 hours, fairly decent fast food, inside the Fabulous Freddys. Don't be afraid of gas station food, this one isn't seedy or anything. It's rather clean and big, with seating inside. No, it's not like my favorite hole in the walls where they don't speak English, but don't turn your nose at this chain.\n\n It's decent late night food and is part of our rotation when we don't want to cook. I come at a certain time at night every night and usually on days we work. I don't know if that makes a difference as it seems its the same cook, but whoever is working after 10pm has been decent."
"So this is gonna be one of 'those' reviews. \nYes, Iam a hater. \n\nGranted, The Sandbar isn't a true Scottsdale club, at least to me, but what would I know, I likes the dive bars. \n\nSo, here's the story. \nI have a habit of becoming good friends with people who like these places. How this happens, I don't know. I guess Iam just that awesome. \n\nBeen dragged here twice, Iam not gonna count the 3rd time because that was more of a 'walked in thru the kitchens back door to get to the restrooms' type of visit. \n\nThe other 2 times I went there were not planned, but same basic experience each time. \n\nThe sandy beach out front is a hassle and I got tired of hearing those girls complaining about how difficult it is to walk thru, duh, its freakin' sand! \nIt took a while for the bartender to make the drinks, since she was the only one in the outside area. \n\n\nAs for inside, lots of MMA inspired shirts and camisoles with no bras, AKA super classy! \nI suppose I chose a bad night, since whenever a UFC fight is on, its super packed with big strong guys watching big strong guys fight on TV, so my fault there. \n\nIn the end, I was bored out of my mind, but highly entertained with the group who was doing the \""Lean Like A Cholo\"" dance while sitting in a booth. \n\nSo, 1 star, and that's being generous."
"\""Not quite what I expected... not quite WHERE I expected either...\""\nReviewed July 24, 2011\n4 people found this review helpful\nI have to agree with another reviewer in that I am not sure how this hotel qualifies as an airport hotel.\n\nI booked this hotel stay for a business (military) event. We had scheduled a team-building group event at the US National White Water Center and so I searched for hotels around that area. When I saw this hotel featured as an airport hotel I figured it would be in a safe enough location with some close-by eateries and quick highway access, etc...\n\nWe booked a total of 13 rooms with them and checked in individually. I had been in contact with one of their hotel managers. I was a little dissatisfied in how poorly I welcomed to the hotel. \n\nThe front desk clerk seemed \""oh-so enthused\"" to be working that night, and when I let her know that I had been in contact with the manager and just wanted to make sure everything was in good standing, she went in the back, he was there, and never even came out to greet me.\n\nNow I didn't expect any VIP treatment. But usually when you organize a group event at a hotel you are give a very warm welcome. I know this because this wasn't a first for me.\n\nI had requested a room with a crib (only two months in advance, with a reminder the day prior), and when I requested one that night, yes the same clerk, took over an hour to get it. At first I wasn't even sure if she was going to because she never did give any indication she was paying attention to me at all.\n\nThe cable and internet did not work our first night there. No apologies were issued.\n\nThe room had a musty smell to it. I have a family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, and one baby) but they only had 3 towel sets in the room...even the next day after housekeeping came.\n\nThe hotel was not in the best of locations, it was secluded and not close to anything, and price-wise you could find better closer to downtown. I am not from Charlotte, NC and had only been there once...and again I figured \""airport\"".\n\nThe hotel interior was nice and they did have a complimentary hot breakfast from served until 0930 am (another fact of information I had to PRY out of the front desk clerk). \n\nThe staff working the morning shift were much more pleasant and inviting. \n\nThe hotel was very quiet at night which we appreciated. The doors did not slam, thank God, as our baby girl is a very light sleeper. The hotel itself is clean and kept nice. It was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express.\n\nI rated poor because of the customer service but overall I would give it a three (average). However, I would not book here again not mainly due to my experience but due to the location. There are better hotels averaging the same distance from the USNWC but in better areas.\n\nIf anyone from management every reads this, please take a look into \""Deborah\"" the front desk jerk...I mean clerk.\n\nStayed July 2011, traveled on business"
Our favourite Japanese rest in our neighbourhood.  Small place.  Nice sushi and sash ini selection.  I enjoyed Udon noodles there last time I went...but the Tempura was a bit on the soggy side.
"Tried 4 things.... all troublesome. \n\nThe spinach ravioli... from Costco!! You know the ones that come in a huge bag with the packet of cheese and herbs? I actually like those ravioli, but Cafe Forte served them in a bath of water and some of the cheese and herb packet. So gross...\nChicken salad sandwich: Not a fan of the chicken salad. Had a mustard taste and had too much mayo. Not a disaster, but I couldn't eat most of it because it just had an odd taste.\nChocolate truffle cake: Half baked brownie batter on a obviously pre-made white crust. I found it odd to serve a chocolate cake on a white crust...\nCarrot cake: Dry, probably store bought...\n\nNever again....."
This review is for Cox Pavilion. I just got back from taking my kids to see Sesame Street Live: Elmo's Healthy Heroes. The cool part is that my monkeys had a blast and got to hug most of the characters (I feel like a badass mommy right now). The other cool part (LITERALLY!) was that they kept the venue at about 50 flippin' degrees. I am guessing it was because the characters on stage get super hot in their furry costumes. That's all fine and dandy but please let us know ahead of time so we can dress properly. My son was almost to the point of tears because he was so cold and my daughter burrowed in my arms (we had all dressed in shorts and t-shirts...its about 90 degrees today). It took away from the performance and was just all around annoying to deal with. \n\nOn a brighter note...the staff is wonderful....super cool to my monkeys. That always makes me happy....just make it a few degrees warmer and you guys get bumped up two stars.
"This was on graduation weekend and mother's day, so I am cutting them a little slack since they were busy.\n\nWe were able to get reservations for my wife's mom and decided it would be a great idea to take her out on mother's day. When we first got there it was pretty packed, it took five minutes before anyone at the counter acknowledge us.\n\nThey sat us down in a booth and an older waitress asked what we would like to drink, we ordered three cocktails and she asked us if we were in a hurry? No we are not, but thanks for asking...The drinks took ten minutes to come out, apparently we should have said we were in a hurry. \n\nFor the starters I got the Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio for myself and Shrimp Cocktail for my wife and her mom, both came out fast and were decent taste wise overall. The waitress to me seemed a little spacy and not quite there, we had numerous other waiters/waitresses stop by in between for refills and checking up on us since she wasn't.\n\nFor entrees we all ordered the Cider Brined \""Double Cut\"" Pork Chops, wait times were roughly 25-30mins. We were anxious to eat it as they were very thick chops, until my wife cut her pork chop open. The center of it was medium rare, borderline rare. Mine was a tad undercooked and also her moms, the waitress even commented and took it all back. They recooked it correctly and ten minutes later we received it back, the meal was above average and we enjoyed it.\n\nNow I normally would let this slip, but the manager proceeded to stop by our table and explain that is how they cook them at Silvercreek and well sorry. I guess the waitress isn't aware of this because she was the one to first point it out. If this is the case, it should be stated on the menu, totally unacceptable and unprofessional behavior as it wasn't really a legitimate apology. The manager there needs etiquette training, you do not act snooty like that to customers.\n\nThe desert we decided on was Caramel creme burlee and I have to say it was perfect. It made up a little bit for the disappointing experience, but hardly a reason to return only for that.\n\nOverall my experience was mostly negative with the service and how things operate there, they try to come off as upper scale but it falls flat. The location they are located it is a little bizarre, as right next door you have some sort of vehicle repair shop and things look a bit run down. For what we paid around $150ish and we did tip *More then we should have*, we did not get our moneys worth.\n\nI can't recommend Silvercreek for the service, location, and price. You will find better places to eat in the area."
"darn it, wish I would have looked at this before sitting down to eat here. It took an hour for us to get our food served. Food was ok if you like a pound of curly fries served with everything. Mine was ok, ordered fish and chips but looked like the kind you buy at the frozen food section. But I was so hungry I ate them all. \nPrices seemed overly high considering the wait time and the quality. \nAlso, had some crappy service from the nearby arcade people after buying some ride tickets for virtual nascar, had to get a refund after waiting an hour there. Thats why we chose the cafe cuz we were tired and hungry. Would definitely advise NOT to eat here or use the arcade services."
Nice location. Too bad Westmount Park is just a bit too far to make it before your ice cream melts! Delicious excellent ice cream and nice place to sit and enjoy.
"This is the only buffet in NYNY.  It's only for breakfast and something of an odd combination.  \n\nFor starters it was $30 for two, not bad for a Vegas buffet.  That is until you see the offerings.  Strange pairings of eggs so firm they were more sliced than scooped, with BBQ pork loin for breakfast?  There were unusual items like pot-stickers and egg -fu-yung on the breakfast buffet.  \n\nThe strange and small assortment of items left us not wanting to return, and we didn't.\n\nThe 2 stars instead of 1 star was solely because the staff kept our cups full."
not worth going to. go to the south rim its better because u can take pictures there as well as free shuttle buses and a theatre. you have to pay to get in on the west rim as well as not bringing no phones no camera. what is the use of paying $74 a person to go on the skywalk and then not using your camera to take photos that is a rip off. everyone comes miles and miles away to come here to take photos.
"On the positive side the delivery was quick... The egg rolls were burnt, tasted like they had been refried. The vegetable soup good portion for sure...  The cabbage in the soup had black spots all over!!!  I will pay a few extra bucks for anything else next time..  The last time I will eat there.."
Allot of good food. Cheesy garlic bread was bomb. Very addictive. Pretty busy night due to prom. Our waitress was very good. We have to make it back for the lasagne. Overall a good experience.
**I'm not eating at a place where they don't practice basic food handling practice.** I paid cash for a lunch special the same person who took my money then started preparing my pizza with out washing his hands. I then asked him why didn't wash his hands first after handling money. He rolled his eyes didn't answer me and left to back. When he finally returned I asked for my money back and I left this place. Feeling bad for the people enjoying there lunch.
"I don't know if I trust these people 100%.  We had a compressor motor go out and they replaced that and we signed up for a service, a day later we heard a knocking and the when the motor was replaced the fan was misaligned so they had to come back out and fix it and they said they thought it was like that before.\n\n6 months later when my 2nd check up came (free under the service agreement) they came out and I wasn't home and they told my wife they we were low on coolant and there was a leak in our condenser.   They just wrote on the receipt leaky in the compressor needs new unit call us $5k.\n\nI never called but they sent me a brochure in the mail a couple weeks later.\n\nOf course now I'm paranoid but the AC has been working fine."
"If you choose just one Mexican restaurant in Mesa, choose this one.  It ranks as one of the best in flavor, authentic food, and decor."
"Really disappointed in our experience last night. The crawfish were VERY tiny. Great flavor, but had to struggle so much to get the meat out of the tiny shell that it mashed it all up. Talked to our server and she confirmed they were smaller than in the past. This was our 3rd time at this location and unfortunately, the last."
The food is just okay. I have had better. Service is slow.
"I love this store. The customer service is on point and there is a feeling of friendship around everyone there. I remember my second time going into this store one of the guys who worked there remembered me and said it was nice to see me, my awkward personality didn't know how to respond but I was happy he remembered me. I wish I would of said thanks or something other than nothing. These guys rock. Also there's a try before you buy cabinet which is awesome. Keep it up guys."
"If you're here on business and in a hurry, beware!  The service is very slow.  You can choose the buffet, which is very pricey and doesn't include coffee or juice, and that's a little quicker.  They seem to be perpetually short-staffed in the morning.  I guess that Bally's figures that since this restaurant is the only game in town - or at least in the hotel - for breakfast, they don't need to make an effort to please their guests.\n\nThey are slow to seat guests.  One of the waiters is terribly rude, although the waitress on the last visit was delightful and did her best in trying circumstances. \n\nIf you stay at Bally's, you either need to get up a lot earlier than you normally would or plan to skip breakfast.\n\nThere's a coffee cart near check-in, but there's no information about it, so if you don't see it, you won't know it's there. I wish I'd known about it earlier in my stay."
"Very poor service at the jewelry counter...I stood there 5 minutes before the clerk \""Sammy\"" even acknowledged my presents. He was walking around the store talking to co-workers. A simple \""I'll be with you in a moment\"" would be a big plus! When he finally did come over to help me he wasn't very knowledgeable about his own merchandise. But he did have very fresh minty breath though...just saying."
"Had dinner last night here. The food left a lot to be desired. Reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough. Really disappointing. I've been here before when I come to Charlotte and had better food. Hopefully, this was a one-off."
"Why on earth do people go to buffets? it feels like cattle lining up and feeding from a trough! most buffet food is bland and mostly over priced anyways. Do people really get their moneys worth? \n\nAnyways, my review is for Breakfast\n\nThe only pro to this buffet was it was free with booking the hotel. The eggs were so runny and cold yuck! every item was pretty bland, bacon was paper thin, every section just had the same selection of things. We would have rather paid our own money and have a nice breakfast somewhere else. I am not a buffet person and probably wont go back to one anytime soon. The bill would have been $45 dollars for fricken breakfast. Id like to know what idiots paying to go to these expensive Vegas buffets thinks paying over $25 for runny eggs is good value?"
Service is horrible !  Simple as that \nI felt like regulars and member of the same race was being favored I waited 15 mins for the table which doesn't bother me at all ! If your busy that's fine \nI sat down and waited for 10 mins no water or anything was brought to me ... 20 mins passed I flagged down a busser and informed him I was ready to order can he notify my sever 30 mins passed \nAnd nothing I told my wife to just wait a lil longer and nothin \nAfter 35 mins they can we ordered and I waited for my 23 mins for my food it arrived I ate and had to wait another 24 mins for my check ...
The food here tastes pretty good although I haven't had enough thai food to judge between good and great. My friends and I all got pad thai during lunch and some said that the medium and mild was a little to spicy for them. The beef in my pad thai seemed slightly overcooked since it wasn't overly tender but it was still pretty good regardless. I would definitely come back
"This place is decent.  Bike-themed insides.  The decor didn't overwhelm me with awesomeness and I am not sure I'll be dying to go back any time soon, but the food was great. I had a burger with Black & Tan onion rings, and we had the hummus to start.  All very good, and good specials on beers, of which there is a good variety, during Happy Hour."
"I come here for 1 thing and 1 thing only - cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nSure, I've tried some of their entr\u00e9es but the only thing that keeps me coming back is their dessert.  No matter what time of day it is, I will always return.\n\nHere's my rating on some of their dishes:\n\nEnglish Style Fish & Chips = 3 stars\nChicken Noodle Soup = 3 stars\nHalf Pound Angus Beef Burger (w/cheese) = 4 stars\nHomemade Meatloaf = 3.5 stars\nReuben = 4 stars\n\nWhat makes their cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e so special?  It's served in a trio dish with the following flavors - regular style, over chocolate, and with bananas. Delish!"
"How lucky we are to have a shop like this!\n\nMy friend and I were looking for something different to do so we signed up for a tea class.  For $15, you get a two hour course discussing the history of tea, different kinds of teas, tea customs, and brewing practices.  It was so interesting!\n\nThere store is just like...a charm on Forbes Ave in Sq Hill.  I grew up in Stuttgart Germany (Deutschland!) and I FLIPPED MY SHIZ when I saw they had the Schwarzwaelder Kirch Wasser Kuche I used to adore when I was a litlte Madchen.\n\nThey have EVERYTHING tea related you could possibly imagine.  Honestly, its a shame I didnt discover this place sooner bc I know I would have bought every mothers day gift here.  Tea pots, cozies, diffusers, cups, straws, stirrers, bags, bag holders, you name it, they have it.  They have a delicious selection of loose leaf teas, and I strongly recommend the Cream Earl Gray flavored tea.  It's so good if I made it for breakfast I'd have to call off work bc I'd be DONE for the day, it is that good.\n\nI felt the prices were reasonable, and Maggie was very very nice, helpful, and easy to talk to.  If you want to try a new tea, stop in, and she'll suggest the perfect one for you.  The tea classes are $15 and I thought it was work every penny and a fun way to spend a Wednesday evening.\n\nThe only thing I didnt like was that there were 15 people packed into the store for the tea class, and basically everything in the store is glass or porcelain, and I was afraid I was going to break something the entire time.  :S"
"SUPER PACKED!!! \n\nthere's a stage with velvet red curtains. we had a VIP table but even the VIP section was overcrowded! \n\ndon't get me wrong, i still had fun. but there were just too many damn people!!!!!!!"
"I've been here a couple of times for brunch.  And every time, something is sort-of off.  First time, my eggs were way overcooked.  The yolks were hard even though they had said they would do sunny side up. Second time, the potato salad they brought with the main dish was basically flavorless and the potato seemed uncooked.\n\nThere was also a very disturbing art exhibit on display the first time I went there.  And a really big disfigured painting of a head in the bathroom that scared me...a bit inappropriate for a small french cafe on willy street.  They should stick to more benign things.\n\nCute, has potential, and maybe I should try it for some other meal (maybe they're not really cut out for brunch), but I was disappointed overall."
I often crave for their tonkotsu ramen! The soup is so full of taste and creamy! No other ramen places can top that! The texture of the ramen is great too! Took a few friends there on several occasions and not once I did not hear compliments. Wish the place was bigger though.
"This building is beautiful inside and out. I came here for Innovation Arizona Summit last week and it was my first time there. Well, inside. I've walked and ran by millions of times. But actually walking inside was a real treat. The summit was a very successful event and I enjoyed exploring the TCA for the first time. It's a very artsy and visually appealing place. I loved seeing the Pedestrian Bridge at sunset from inside. Very cool."
Wow.  What a bunch of stoners.
Juice bar does not wash the produce. I asked why and they said since its organic we don't wash it.. Be careful or insist that they wash the produce.. This is a health hazard and extremely dangerous for the elderly and children.
"I have been here many many times and it never gets old. The hardest part about being there is trying to choose what rolls you want.  Its a pretty small place, which I love.... its very ambient and relatively romantic.\n\nNever had a problem with service or waiting either."
"We went to this place as usual and were surprised to see a \""shrunken\"" happy hour menu. We ordered calamari and lobster tacos and were unhappy with these orders. They had no taste and were overlooked. It seems to us the quality of this place is going down!! Sad for that given the fact we are regulars!!!"
"When that craving for some food from the island hits, there's no escaping it.\n\nIt's a hunger like no other. Luckily, over at Island Flavor, they give some of the largest portions that I have ever seen. It's like Hash House A Go Go-portions for Hawaiian Cuisine, except the food here is actually good.\n\nThe place was a bit on the empty side around 11am on a late Saturday morning. Seeing an empty place on a weekend always leaves me a bit hesitant to eat somewhere. But, I had a gut instinct telling me to eat here anyway. I'm glad I did. Here's what we went with:\n\nFried Rice Omelet - When this dish is served to you, it looks like a majestic mountain pile, capped at the peak with a generous amount of scrambled egg. Along with it, comes three giant pieces of Portuguese sausage, nestled around the edges of the plate. The fried rice, packed underneath, has to be some of the best fried rice that I've ever had in this town. It had a bit of a unique sweet flavor to it, mixed in with some small bits of diced pork. I'm pretty sure this serving was good enough to feed 3-4 people. I stared at this modern marvel for a few seconds before I dug in. It was beautiful sight.\n\nLoco Moco - Another heavily portioned dish with a likewise amount of brown gravy, to boot. I sampled a bit of it. Not bad! the hamburger patty included with it was humongous, as expected. Loco Moco is much too heavy a dish for me to conquer on my own. I'd probably come back for this if I wanted to drown a day of depression in gravy.\n\nHuge portions, great flavors, friendly staff.. there's isn't much more I could want in a restaurant."
"Along one end of the Luxor in the center casino area is the Pyramid Cafe. It's mostly a small area raised a few feet off the pyramid floor. There aren't really walls, so it does give you a view of weary, ragged-around-the-edges folks mindlessly working the slots at 3 am.\n\nThere's a fairly broad menu ranging from burgers to 24 hour breakfast. Out of sheer convenience, I ate here twice; once a breakfast type meal and the other dinner. Although different foods, the experience was similar.\n\nBoth times service was pretty slow, even when the place was only partly full and the number of patrons barely outnumbered the servers. Breakfast came with a nice helping of ham but runny eggs and wilted hash browns. A burger for dinner was okay; I rather liked the fries that came with it, but it was a pretty small helping. Prices had the expected resort markup.\n\nI give two stars here, not that it's a particularly bad place, but it just seems to do everything a little below average. There's nothing egregious here and I'd eat here again in the right circumstances, but everything is sort of a C-/D+ level. I'd say that this is best for a basic meal if you're in the Luxor area or for a 4 am chowdown after a night on the town."
"Pulled pork sandwich = 2stars (meat cold, not enough sauce)\nWing Sunday .50 = 5 stars (no complaints)\nHot link = 3 stars (could tell good flavor but burnt and seemed like Sat leftover)\nBuffalo Fries = 5 stars (delicious) \nOverall = 4 (weird setup for refills and no access to BBQ sauces so 1st time have no idea what we'd like)"
"I must say, this is definitely not on my \""favorite, oh my gosh I love this place\"" Chinese joints. I love the price of the stuff here, and I always end up finding myself here to feed a big group of people, or to fix a really really late night craving for Chinese food. \n\nService is generally really fast, but the food is normally on the salty side, like \""oh my gosh I can totally taste the MSG\"" and I normally get a headache after eating here and I think it's from the seasoning, or just the MSG they add to the meals. The place isn't super clean, but it's not disgusting dirty. I do like the taste of their hot tea here that they serve. \n \nFood is nicely portioned, so like I said, I definitely like the price of everything here especially because they have the \""special price/portioned\"" menu. It's easy to feed a party of 10+ more people and end up only paying $10-$15 each if you split the bill'' and you'll have order a shit load of food, like over 6 or 7 dishes. This is a good place to come and eat if you're hungry and you wanna split the bill so you can try everything that's ordered.\n\nThey normally do a good job at accommodating very large groups. Bathroom isn't all that clean, so I would suggest hold it if you can. \n\nOh and parking is a total bitch in the plaza where this restaurant is located so know you have been warned. When the parking lot is full (which it normally is always full) you have to park in the Chinatown parking lot next to this plaza."
"$3 for a bowl of rice!!! Yikes! Late night dining options at the Wynn were limited and led us to this place. We ordered bbq pork, bbq duck and two bowls of rice $45. OMG! Sam Woo bbq we could of eaten the same thing for like $15 and it would of tasted better. I don't mind paying for a good meal, but being over charged for mediocre food just makes me pout. The server was an automaton, no smile, no energy, no emotion. Sad, Wynn, Sad! I just wanted a tasty late night dinner but no go at Red 8."
"Wonder why they keep the lights low in this establishment? It's because they're serving you rotten food.\nI had THE most horrible experience at this restaurant, so bad in fact that I will never visit another Rainforest Cafe at any location again in my lifetime. \nOur party had 4 people in it and we wanted to grab something to eat before watching Love. I ordered a Portobello Mushroom Burger (only maybe 2 vegetarian options on the menu). Our server was nice but the service was extremely slow.\nFinally we got our food. My burger was lukewarm and my fries cold. It was bland, dry, distasteful,  and even the presentation was horrible. About 1/3 of the way into my burger I felt as if the taste was off. I opened the bun to find that the shredded lettuce they put on my burger was wilted, brown, and rotting. Disgusting! I lost my appetite immediately. \nI waited and waited and waited for our server to finally come over to check on us. Upon mentioning to him that I was disappointed and dissatisfied with my order he offered to get the manager of the restaurant. I accepted. Another waiting game. Our server returned and told us that \""the manager is too busy\"" to come to our table. Mind you the restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full given that we came during the off season. At this point we wanted to just leave. I asked if I could get the price of my meal deducted from the tab and he walked off to get our bill. 5 minutes later the manager comes to our table.\nShe asked what the problem was, I told her, and  her reply was \""our lettuce isn't rotten, the cook checked it, the lettuce wilts when it comes into contact with heat\"" which is true but it does not cause the lettuce to brown. Browning means that is is old and rotting. I explained this to her and she looked dead at me and said (with a horrible snide attitude) \""You didn't realize the lettuce was rotten after already eating half of it?\"" Never in my life have I had a manager of an establishment sass me while I point out their product is below mediocre. She deducted half of the price of the burger after giving everyone at our table a horrible attitude and experience. \nNo one in my party ever wants to visit another Rainforest Cafe based on the experience the manager gave us. \nIf you want amazing food, excellent service for a decent price go to Gordon Ramsey's BurGR in Planet Hollywood. The difference, literally, is night and day."
"Had two new Sushi Rolls here!\n\nBeing vegan longer then Ive been eating sushi, means that I really haven't had allot of different types of sushi. Usually I am in luck if the Miso Soup doesn't have fish, and they have inari, avocado, cucumber, or mushroom rolls.\n\nI asked the waiter if they had any vegan dishes, and to my surprise he was very knowledgeable about veganism, and all of the ingredients included in each dish.\n\nI chose two of his recommendations as this was to be a mini meal while walking around the veags strip.\n\nUME SHISHO ROLLS\nMint, Radish?, and another item (I cant remember what) \nThis was AMAZING!! so good, and taste changing cool yet spicy so unique!)\n\n\nKENKO ROLLS\nKampyo, Asparagus, Napa Cabbage, Avocado, Cucumber, Oshinko\n(crunchy textures, clean taste)\n\nPrice was a little high even though we got one of the cheaper sakis, but was still worth it. \n\nTheir Sake and Japanese Beer list is very extensive.\n\nBesides the new favorite sushi rolls, the architecture in here was beautiful, we sat at the bar and looked at the squares and lights, that I think someone must have handmade as the pattern doesn't repeat and it seems like someone had to cut each plexi class square, unbelievable to look at and imagine!\n\n-I'll be back! - \n\n& hopefully make it to the real Shibuya in Japan someday ;)"
"Wow-wee-wow! I didn't hate this place; I sure liked it a lot better than the previous reviewer (Tiger W.), but it was rather mundane.... 'ho-hum', if you will. Not terrible at all, just nothing special. Good if you're hungry and not looking for a fancy-schmancy experience. I recommend on those terms. Good price."
Never eating at a Denny's in Vegas again.. I thought it was just the Denny's on fort apache and trop but I guess it's this one as well.. First of all the establishment is filthy! They need a surprise health inspection ASAP! My glass came out with lipstick on it so I asked for another glass and the server just looked at me like I ugh.. Okay!?! Then our food came out and it was swimming in oil.. Hmmm yummy! Then I notice hair in my food =\\  can you say gross! After that I completely lost my appetite.. Never again..
"Worst place ever. Not only did they get my order wrong, they didn't put CHICKEN in our chicken sandwich! All it had was cheese and bacon between two buns! Our sodas were filled with ice that the straw would not fit and they were flat. The girl working the drive thru seemed nice, but I would have preferred to have gotten what I ordered."
"OK, this place is not for your average pet owner...\n\nThe prices here are higher than PetSmart or other kennels, but the accomodation and service are exceptional:  \n\n1)  Even the base rooms are quite large.  My 80lb Labrador had a 5x12 room with his own TV, persian rug, and doggy bed.  There is even a Presidental Suite that is bigger and more luxorious than a lot of studio apartments.  \n\n2)  The animals are only locked up at night... all day they get to run around in one of two large areas inside and play with the other dogs.  They also have a grassy area indoors to allow the dogs to do their duty.  :)\n\n3)  The staff is very friendly and loves animals.  My dog lost about 7 lbs during a 2-week stay here due to all of the running around with the other dogs... they actually called me told me he looked skinny asking if they could up the amount of food he was getting.\n\n4)  Location is very convienant to the airport--easy to drop off and pick up.\n\n5)  Everything is indoors, so there is no need to worry about your dog running off while being walked on the leash.  Also, during the summer months, it is comforting to know that my dog is not outside dying in the heat.\n\nThey also offer Doggy Day Care which has proven useful a few times."
"I have to admit. I have never heard of this place. A friend of mine, his dad was playing there. They were busy in the Restaurant, but had a few tables on the back patio empty. So we went back to the patio where we had people waiting for us and there were actually 2 additional people there as well who were not eating, but when the server walked by I tried to order and he told me I would have to wait 30 minutes because that is the waiting time. \nWell by the time I told my friend's dad who was singing there, we finally got served our food. It was pretty good and a decent price. The Owner seemed to be a real nice guy, but his employees were terrible, awful. I always give a place a second chance otherwise I would have only given them one star."
"Dr. Resnick has provided hands-down the best dental experience I've ever had. Initially, I came to his office with excruciating pain while dreading the financial burden that I knew would inevitably come with solving my dental problems. I was greeted warmly by the office staff and Dr. Resnick's concern was primarily for me and alleviating my pain while assuring me that there were solutions to the financial side of things. In short, he took x-rays, extracted the wisdom tooth that was causing problems and laid out a treatment plan that was surprisingly affordable. Also, he did an amazing job AVOIDING having to do a root canal (and the dollars coming from it) on an adjacent tooth to save me money and pain.  Most importantly, he acted with kindness and empathy throughout my treatment. I'm now, amazingly, a raving fan of a dentist - something I didn't think would result from the agony I was experiencing. Thank you, Dr. Resnick for being a top-notch person AND dentist!"
"Walnut Grill is one of my favorite spots for an afterwork drink or a quick, fresh meal. Their menu is American fare with a twist, their wine list is excellent, and the atmosphere is always fun. They recently expanded the bar area to have more seating and comfy booths. The servers remember you if you're a frequent flyer and are always efficient. They have great live music some nights, too! I'll pretty much always be a regular here!"
"Love this place. My friends and i go here often for breakfast. The mardigras omelette is good as well as the eggs benedict. this place gets busy in themornings on Sunday so there will be a little bit of a wait sometimes. Overall good breakfast or brunch place, they also serve dinner as well."
Everything you could need is here.  Yes you can venture out... But why would you?!
"This place sucks...... no seafood..... service is not great and people are not too friendly.after asking the waiter if they offered any seafood at all he just replied with\"" you have the menu,read it,I will be back\"""
Waited for 45 minutes for my husband to get his hair cut because he was skipped. When we asked if he was next they said he had one person in front of him when the only other person in the place came in after us. There were five people working and only one cutting hair. The rest stood up at the register. They said it was cause they couldn't figure out their new system. I don't see how it took 4 people to figure it out. We just left. Lost our business.
"To be completely honest I hate this Home Depot . It is in a horrible part of town and the \""workers\"" ill call them are EVERYWHERE. I pull into Home Depot around 530 am and about 15 ft into the lot I have \""workers\"" practically throwing themselves at my van trying to wave me down . \n\nAlso other pet pieves is that since there are so many out here (20-30) no joke every day, They have people strolling around on bikes selling you tamales, ice cream, and those chips and salsa. And my biggest laugh was during lunch one day i was working at the Carls Jr and there were about 10 of them playing soccer in thw parking lot!!! WOW \n\nNow I have no problem with them trying to get work and make a living but when you bring 50+ people to a business Lot and it turns the lot into your own private soccer field and stadium with vendors that just drives me nuts."
"I was entertained by business associates at Bobby's while in Vegas on business and that's the only reason I gave it one star instead of zero since I didn't have to pay for it. Our party had drinks, appetizers, entrees and dessert and later that night I took a co worker out for pizza. The food is overpriced and the servings are tiny. I was told the entr\u00e9e I ordered wasn't available and my fall back order, steak tenderloin, was about the size of a silver dollar and served on a plate the size of a manhole cover. The d\u00e9cor was pleasant, the servers were good and the food was tasty but for what we paid for it it wasn't worth the trouble."
"I'm sorry but the sushi chef that was here today when I was in was HORRIBLE he put a pickled radish in our tuna mango possion roll because he didnt have mango, didnt tell us and still served that crap to my family. THEN he put the kimchi sauce on our mexican roll and didnt even put the right ingredients in it. The service was awful all the woman waitresses were at a table eating while we ate and we would have to call across to them to get service. I use to love this place, I will NEVER come back....TRASH!"
Hey I went into this place after reading all the raving reviews.... gotta say was disappointed with the people in it. I walked in and their doors have a chime to let them know ... someone came up to see and did not even say hello nothing. Then 3 to 4 minutes later another patron walks in young blond etc and I suddenly hear him greet her and ask if she would like any help. He also asked another lady who was in the same room if she needed help..\nThese 2 men walked around and not once was i asked for assistance. I am in the healing industry and was very keen to purchase some items....\nThe store was not as impressive as it was made out. And if you are in the business of selling these items keep an open heart and a welcoming presence.
"NEVER GO HERE.\nAs soon as we walked in, we were given a tray, at the bar. They were \""fresh out of the dishwasher\"". However, they were dripping wet, and when I reached out for mine, there was a sauce like substance that I got on my hand. \nWhen I tried to tell the waitress about it, she didn't believe me, informing me of how \""clean they were\"". I had to show her my dirty hand for her to wipe it off. She didn't even offer me a napkin.\nWhen our drinks came, my friend noticed big black floaties in her glass. The waitress blamed it on the tea filter.\nAnother waitress asked if things were going ok, and I said no, telling her about the dirty items.\nShe argued with me about it! What kind of staff argues with a customer! \nWE WALKED RIGHT OUT, AND YOU SHOULD TOO.\nIf I could give ZERO stars, I would. This place is filthy!"
"Vegas casinos boast some good mid-range burger joints, BLT Burger, Le Burger Brassiere (at Paris hotel), and of course the Burger Bar at Mandalay.   I wish I could differentiate between the three, but they are all quality eats IMO and worth checking out.\n\nBLT Burger is located w/in Mirage next to a busy walkway and often doesn't have big lines or a wait due to the neighboring food joints.   All I've ever had here is the #2.  Forget the name, but its the blue cheese and caramelized onion burger... with of course bacon added.   Always cooked to perfection.   Dripping in juice of course.\n\nWhat's keeping this from a 5-star place is that I've never been thrilled with the fries or onion rings.   I also wish there were sweet potato fries (ala Burger Bar) but all in all, minor complaints here.  Service is attentive and good.  Central location.   Reasonably priced of course.   Worth checking out especially if you're in the neighborhood."
"Hate the wait especially in winter but love everything else about it. I do want to give it a five star but had to knock one off just because of my love for potatoes and apparently my go to \""Morning after breakfast\"" doesn't come with it. Although stealing those delicious  Lyonnaise potatoes from my partners plate has never been an issue. \n\nEvery time we've been here we've never had any bad experience with the food or the service. Highly recommended for breakfast."
Please update your hours on Yelp. We stopped by to get something framed at 5:32pm and you were closed even though it said 6pm on Yelp.
"Giving this place an extra star because our server was really sweet. We came with a large group of about 15 people and they sat us in the upstairs area next to a foreboding \""Max. Occupancy: 9\"" sign. Luckily, we all survived the experience, but the service was exceptionally slow and the food was pretty disappointing. I thought you could never go wrong with fish & chips at a British pub, but mine didn't have any flavor at all. The server felt bad that we had to wait so long so she brought us all plates of \""chip butties\"" which are just french fries on a buttered roll. Don't knock it til you try it... that was actually better than most of our meals.\n\nThis place does seem fun as a bar since they had Monday night football on and people were very into it."
"I went when the A/C was broke and 122 degrees outside, but they were so nice and we were hungry so we stayed because my cousin recommended it.\n\nI had a Thai tea w/ boba, fresh shrimp chips, and duck on steamed buns. Very unique burgers that have a signature taste. I ate everything and wanted more. Asian portions (just enough) which I don't mind because the quality made up for the quantity.\n\nWill be back when we come back to Vegas!"
I've read a lot of reviews for this gym and have to disagree with most. I've never seen a dirty bathroom or unfriendly staff member. \n\nTons of machines and free weights are up to date. Lots of cardio machines and benches.\n\nStaff is really helpful and overall friendly environment. \n\nI recommend the spin class on mondays and sundays and the cardio kickbox class on wednesdays.\n\nThe juicebar has plenty of great smoothies and nutritional foods to help you out when you need a little boost.
"Exceptional restaurant in Charlotte and much better than a lot of the locally owned ones.  Service was outstanding, as was the food.  Here's a rundown of our order.\n\nStarters\nSteamed Littleneck Clams--These are fantastic and are bathing in a garlic/herb cream sauce that you will hang onto to sop your bread up with.  Very fresh clams and a decent portion for a starter--about 15 clams.\nRaw Oysters--I had a tasting menu of 3 varieties and found the Canadian oysters the best.  My favorite was the Beau Rivage.  Some of the oysters were very undersized and some were oversized.  It would be nice if they evened out the sizes for sharing reasons.\n\nMains\nBlackened Mahi-Mahi...the fish in the dish was fantastic.  The sauce was a bit too much I felt and dominated the fish.  It was a spicy tomato sauce.  Would not order again.  The rice side was also dismal.\nSea Bass-Perfect.  This is the opposite of the mahi mahi because in this dish the fish is the star and not the sauce...although the gremolata butter is subtle and fantastic.  Sides of mash and asparagus and carrots were great.  Truly a great plate of food.\n\nDessert\nApple Upside Down Pie....fantastic.  Will disappear in less than 5 minutes guaranteed.\n\nThis is a really nice restaurant that does most things right.  I look forward to going back and trying more of the menu.  All the ingredients are super fresh and I think I would recommend ordering something that is light on the sauce and stars the fresh seafood."
"I used to get my hair cut close to work, trying a few different places, but I was never fully satisfied.  These guys are close to home, reasonably priced, and they do a great job!  They remember conversations of things I don't even remember telling them.  I would describe the  experience as having your hair cut by a friend.  In regard to the bad reviews...I guess I could see them doing it...they are edgy and honest, but they care!  If you want cookie cutter go to the mall, if you want edgy sincerity, along with great quality, these guys are great!"
"Not the best soul good I've ever eaten. My collard greens mixed with mustards? Were tough. The fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about. Salmon cakes were good. Mac n cheese can pass for soul food. Yams were great! Corn bread mediocre, overall it was okay. Don't believe the hype, especially if you were brought up on Mamas soul food cooking."
"As per usual with gyms like Gold's, beware of the hidden fees. Gym is okay....equipment and surroundings are dated and past their prime. Make sure you read the fine print. I just went to quit my contract and found out I had been charged a fee of $39 for annual renewal, whatever that entails. You need to give 31 days notice of quitting so they can gouge another months fee out of you. The lady Amanda told me that I was unlikely to get a refund on the annual fee I saw and that I was to be charged another month also. They don't really care if you are unhappy at Gold's. They just want to get as much cash out of you as possible. I will continue to work out at my apartment complex at Camden. Much nicer and free bottled water."
"The restaurant here is horrible. The food is okay, nothing special but not awful. However, the service is probably the worst I have ever experienced. I went with a group of coworkers and the waiter repeatedly screwed up. He forgot our orders and had to come back and ask, brought somebody the wrong drink and somebody else got the wrong entree, and to top it off, he charged us for more food than we actually ordered. Luckily one of my coworkers caught the mistake. We talked to the manager and he gave us extra game cards which really didn't make up for the horrible service but at least it was something. I do not recommend this place for food"
"I flew into Las Vegas for a business trip back on January 9, 2013.  After reading favorable reviews on one-star hotels and motels, I decided to stay here at the Crestwood Suites right off of Las Vegas Boulevard, just a few minutes south from the strip.  While being able to get good night's rest on my one-night stay, the room and its facilities have their fair share of pros and cons.\n\nOn the positive side, the place has a very nice price point, basic amenities and friendly customer service.  Reserving via Priceline's website, not utilizing the \""name your own price\"" service, the daily rate of $58 per night was affordable.  The room has all of the basic amenities, like shampoo, soap, iron and iron board, etc.  There's even a stove, refrigerator, cabinets and sink.  And also for a local hotel to have a good caliber of customer service, concern and interaction, at least that brought a lot of ease in my mind.\n\nHowever, I believe all those pluses don't cover up the two drawbacks of this place.  First off is the presence of the remnant secondhand cigarette smoke in the hallway and my room, which is on the first floor wing.  On top of hotel patrons, I personally couldn't believe how maids could make a living cleaning the rooms with this \""stench\"" of a smell present.  Plus it personally sucks to have my clean clothes be adored with this type of smell!  Also, the room sofa has that small, yet disgusting, dry white stain sort of similar to Monica Lewinsky's \""blue dress.\""\n\nDespite these findings, the hotel is okay to stay in.  My recommendation for those who want to \""roll the dice\"" by saving your money and their lungs, request a different room higher than the first floor or look somewhere else."
"Everyone is so friendly, in particular, Myra in the Impulse department.  She's always friendly and has a good eye for fashion.  She has no problem telling me what looks good on me and what doesn't.  She's never pressured me into buying anything and for that I keep going back - been over 2 years.  \n\nI love this location.  It's always so clean and the layout is easy on the eyes.  I don't get overwhelmed when I walk in.    I agree with others when the selections are as big as other locations but their level of customer service by far stand out.  \n\nHaving a Starbuck's at this location and a handful of coupons is always a good day."
"Ate here with Donny C for a friends bday, but sat at a different table.  We received this promotion where it was buy one get one free.  \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered crab cakes, calamari, and a salad.\n\nThe crab cakes were good,  but the calarmari and crab salad were forgettable.  The crab salad looked like it was just a head of lettuce with some sauce and crab piled on top of it.\n\nI ordered the surf n turf as my buddy really wanted to order it.  Since it was buy one get one free, value wise I thought okay I\""ll get this.  The steak was ok, but nothing compared to Cut's steak.  The lobster was a tad bit over cooked.\n\nThe servers/waiters do NOT fill up your water glasses.  They took our appetizers away even though we weren't even done with them!  Poor service.\n\nWill not return..  The fish looked alot better.  Good thing we got half off everything!"
"Still one of my favorite restaurants across the country & def in this city.  The one in Miami does not take reservations this one does!   I get almost the same thing every time and every time I'm overjoyed! It never disappoints and the service is impeccable. \n\nThis is a place for sharing, if you are not a sharer maybe not for you.\n\nIf it's your first time or you've been before here's my favorites:\n\n1) Stonecrab- remember season is Oct 15- May 15 (2 days before my birthday) so ordering them in this time frame will ensure optimum pleasure.  Anytime else, they are frozen and while still good not GREAT. Joe's mustard sauce is INFAMOUS and amazing but keep in mind it's mayo based so opt for less than more. [see pix]\n2) Roasted Corn- amazing- simple plain with a touch of heat and lime\n3) Creamed Spinach- oh lord this is not on the diet BUT you are eating shellfish so it's kinda ok, ish\n4) Seafood Salad- dressing on the side for me. It's divine\n5) Pretzel roll and or onion and cheese roll oh lordie\n6) potatoes I can do with or without\n7) FRIED CHICKEN- yes I know, my friend is Kosher, this is what he orders, it's damn near amazing, only reason I've ever even tried it\n8) King Crab legs- about the same price as your first born but in the long run cheaper than a kid! [see pix]\n9) dessert- ice cold key lime pie is what they are known for but their Havana one is knock your socks off good too."
There is the old school Denny's that have been there forever and then there is the new Denny's. This is a new one. Very clean and modern. Always full. Always friendly and fast service.
"So my kid was sick with a cough and then after three days seemed to get better. Then, the night of her seeming improvement she tanked. Chills, fever, and a back ache... (Red alert.) She fell asleep on the sofa as I cooked her dinner. I tried to wake her up but she was out cold (but with sweating.) I sat next to her trying to check her temperature when she suddenly sat up and said her stomach really hurt, so I ran with her to the bathroom. Just as I was congratulating myself on diverting disaster in her own words, \""Mommy I threw up a rainbow.\"" If it had been a unicorn we would have been on our way to PCH, but after some cleaning up and a warm bath I got her back to bed. I stayed up until three in the morning until her fever broke, turning her pillow over to the cool side, and blowing cool air on her neck, and petting her hair and wishing her back to well. Wishing didn't work so I got on the phone. In the morning I called her amazing group of doctor's and got her in immediately. And that is how it is done at Camelback Pediatrics, they  always see her if I call and request it. Her Doctor is Dr. Alexander and my daughter is madly in love with him, especially at three... she would cover her mouth and smile and giggle like a little geisha. We both love her doctor... he is smart, laid back, has a great sense of humor, is great with kids, and he explains things in a way a first time mom can understand. (He's been doing it for over twenty years so he has it down.) When my kid didn't walk at almost two years his diagnosis... she was lazy (it was a joke but it made me feel better... as I am very lazy and I thought, finally, something she gets from me.) She was walking weeks later. I just needed to relax and stop doing all her bidding (yeah, she was talking almost the moment she came out of the womb bossing me around so why walk?) The staff is all friendly and accommodating and we have seen almost every doctor in the practice and they are all wonderful. The waiting room is set up so well patients wait on one side of the office and sick on the other (smart.) To bad my own doctor's office isn't run so well. I wish I could take credit for finding such an amazing doctor but my friend Pam gave me the good advice. So thanks Pam! And thanks to Dr. Alexander for taking such great care of my little rainbow maker..."
"All dogs go to heaven, but first you have to repent at Franktuary.  \n\nAt first I was an unbeliever.  I mean, how good can you make a haute dog?  I was blind, but now I see.  Just have a little faith!  I tried the classic Texan (chili + cheese + jalapenos) and a gourmet Pittsburgh (coleslaw + smooshed pierogie aka pot-sticker wrapping).  I liked the type of hot-dog buns used.  It didn't collapse or split under pressure.  It must be a sin to make a hot-dog so divine.  I slurped down the heavenly blue (blueberry blackberry raspberry) fruit shake very quickly."
"I've been here 3 times and fell in love the first time because the cheese ravioli and the garlic bread is amazing!  The second time was just as good, because i got the same thing.  My boyfriend got a seafood pasta and it was not good...it was waaaay too salty.  Well...we hadn't been there for about 5 months and I had forgotten about his bad experience and apparently so did he.  We went there the other night and the service was great as usual, but the food was entirely tooooo salty.  My manicotti tasted strange and was not a typical manicotti.  My boyfriend's meat ravioli was so salty that he couldn't eat it...nor could I.  Unfortunately, we won't be going there again.  It is a great place to have a drink and lounge with friends since they frequently have entertainment.  It's a very charming place."
"Ok so I am an city girl living in a desert world, but I'm a pretty nice gal, all things considered, I think... Anyhoo, l I have to say the service at Peter Piper Pizza was one of the most deplorable experiences I have ever experienced, and that is saying alot considering that I have been to Chuckie Cheese (which happens to have the worst pizza ...ever).  The food at Peter Piper Pizza was actually quite tasty, but the service was horrible.   \n\nThe countergirl was rude, and uninformed.  Her supervisor was just as clueless.  \n\nAs a mother I am subject to these kid-friendly pizza joints, but the service was so bad it made Chuckie Cheese look like an exclusive Club!"
"This place was probably the worst disappointment of our Vegas trip.  We stayed at Palazzo and wandered over to the Venetian's faux Italy world for dinner.  They had numerous little \""outdoor\"" cafes to choose from, Wolfgang Puck, Mario Batali, and other famous chefs so, we figured any one of them would be extraordinary.  \n\nWe opted for this little place due to my Italian food obsession.  We ordered 2 pasta dishes (TAGLIATELLE ALLA CASTELLANA and LINGUINE ALLA BURANELLA) , the first was very underdone and bland and other was a hot garlic mess.\n\nReally, for the price, I've had better food at The olive Garden"
"Do yourself a favor and go explore the art district (\""Roosevelt Row\"").  Just wandering around the area is a neat experience as there is so much to see and do.  Lots of neat restaurants, parks, and shops.  The homes are so beautiful.  Parts of the area remind me of certain areas of Chicago.  If you're visiting for the first time, you'll find yourself forgetting you're in the middle of the desert.\n\nOne of the stops on your way through the art district should be the Japanese Friendship Garden.  It's cheap (5 bucks!  6 if you want to feed the koi) and beautiful.  It really only takes about 30 minutes or so to see the whole thing, but just stopping to relax and reflect for a while can be a very rewarding experience.  The grounds are well kept and breathtakingly beautiful.  It's very quiet and relaxing.\n\nI'm not sure what the other reviewers were talking about when they said they had a problem taking cameras in.  We had cameras, as did everyone else we saw inside.  I got some AMAZING pictures when we were there.  We never had any problems.  There is a sign that says you can't take professional equipment inside without a contract, but that is to be expected.  \n\nOverall, a very nice experience.  This isn't something you would go far out of your way to visit, but definitely worth stopping by while you're doing other things in the area.  That whole area of downtown is super cool."
"Love the breakfast buffet here. My favorites were the eggs benedict, eggs florentine, crepes, salads, desserts and coffee. All top quality from the service received to our freshly brewed, flavorful coffees. Eggs benny were perfect which is impressive to maintain for a buffet sitting under the heat lamps. If you go 1/2 hr. before the lunch turnaround, you'll get to experience lunch items too. Will be back on our next trip!"
To bad I can't give less then a 1 star.This place is unreal I haven't been here 1 time where I didn't have to wait more then 2 hours..I'm here right now waiting for my son's temp cap to get put on and it's taken over 2 hours just for a temp! Not to mention its the second temp due to the fact they screwed up the permenent tooth! This is not the first time either THIS PLACE SUX... Do ur self a favor and drive out to the Goodyear Bright Now Dental they are MUCH better like by a mile! These people do not care about how much of ur time they waist...They just say oh 20 more mins...20 more mins till ur here all damn day..Why lie if it's gonna take 2 hours just say so and I'll leave and come back they lie ..yep I just checked n again 30 mins after they told me 20 more mins now 5 more mins that will really be 20MINS RUDE!
"Not A Good Value.\n\nWow, I 'm a bitch. I just realized that I gave Lin's Grand Buffet four stars.\n\nOver the years we have become rather stringent in our reviews. There is no sense in being conciliatory when there are so many other restaurants to patronize. Our dollars go only so far. So if you are a reader who will eat just about anything you may like this place a lot. It starts out very promising. It is neat and clean inside and quite romantic, and the people are friendly. Great date night for intimacy --just not for foodies. If you have a trained palate you will get more out of this review. If you like anything, then you will probably not get much out of this review. We love all food--even truck food. We don't discriminate, but we give fair reviews and credit only where credit is due.\n\nStarted with the breadbasket. There were 2 of us, so only 2 rolls brought. They were small and stale. We also had the pepperdews stuffed with goat cheese (six per order at $6 a plate), and the bruschetta (we chose an order with half tomatoes and half crab meat. There were two of each.)\n\nThe goat cheese appetizer was cold- not at room temperature- therefore the sweetness of the pepperdews was a bit cloying, but redeemed with the pepper flavored olive oil. A dollar a bite! Kinda leaves a bad taste.\n\nIn our opinion the pepperdews should have been packed in extra virgin olive oil and stored at room temperature--and the cheese filling taken out of the fridge an hour before opening the restaurant. The entire appetizer should be room temperature--if they had been we could have eaten another plate of them. The idea of them is appetizing, but the presentation abysmal. Side note: The bit of green  on top was wilted to the point of browning and would make Chef Ramsey cry. Flair is not as important in our book. But, just saying...\n\nThe bruschetta, for the money, was a huge disappointment. While there was a sufficient amount of crab on each slice of toast, the bread was not fresh, it was not piping hot, and the crab was absolutely frigid. Crab should have been warmed up first, then served over PIPING HOT, TOASTY bread--which it was not. The crab was (obviously fake) another kind of flaky white fish. Barely passable. The garlic was abundant and good. The tomatoes were sweet cherry tomatoes. We would take imported canned San Marzanos al fiorno over fresh cherry tomatoes any day of the week. Just a disappointment.\n\nMy Sicilian husband pronounced the bruschetta as an  Italian would (broo-SKETT-ah). The waitress passive-agressively shamed him, by repeating it twice as most Americans say it (broo-SHETTA), which only showed her ignorance. Otherwise, she was extremely friendly and talkative and the service was consistently good throughout our meal. I am being very fair here. She was truly nice, but she was sort of clueless.\n\nOur California Chardonnay was $29 for the bottle and our server described it as oak barrel aged. It had zero oak--so we think our server possibly made a bit of a mix up there. Anyway, it was just \""okay\"". I expect a lot more for the money, but even then, we still consider $29 for a bottle a low price/every day price and yet it should have been better, but then wine is totally subjective in our humble opinion.\n\nWe ordered a margharita pizza because we didn't think they could possibly disappoint us with something as beautiful and simple as tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. Oh boy-- it was PRACTICALLY INEDIBLE!\n\nThe crust was decent, even a bit blackened on the bottom like we like it. And that's where that ends. The cheese was a fancy shred blend--like something you'd buy at the grocery store. HORRIBLE. Where were our fresh dollops of beautiful mozzarella? The basil was fresh and friseed, They put cherry tomatoes on this pizza! Not good Amano! Not good! The tomatoes were too small...too sweet. Just...wrong. This is not the pizza of our homeland. Barely palatable. The reason for one star.\n\nIn our ongoing effort to find something noteworthy we did something that is law in our book--if the menu offers creme brulee we order it, even if we are not hungry. Creme brulee is a godsend. Unfortunately, the creme brulee here is \""meh\"". If you've had truly great creme brulee nothing else will compare. The best we ever had was at Cafe Cherie in Montreal. It was in a low, wide dish with a thick, rich custard and thick, hard sugar top. Amano serves a small light creme brulee with a sugar top as light as an angel's wing. If that's your thing you'll love it. The vanilla bean had a good flavor. It just fell short in our book, and again--it was frigid, like almost everything else we ate there. Amano--you must take things out of the fridge! You'd solve most of your problems if you did. We did not order the olives for fear they would be pulled from a fridge."
"Once you arrive at their office, you sign some papers and they get you fitted for a helmet and goggles. After that, you watch a brief video on the do's and don't's of riding. Once the whole gang arrives and finishes they will drive you to some dunes nearby which was about a 15 minute drive. \n\nDuring our course, we did have a mishap in that one of the wheels popped off the buggy on one of the members in my party. So it took a little bit of time for them to fix it and get back on the sand. None of that deterred me from having the time of my life. I do feel that smaller parties is best so that we can drive as close to its maximum speed allowed and not have to wait or risk tailgating. \n\nI purchased a groupon deal for this. It was a 15 minute dune buggy ride for two buggys at $88. Quite expensive but I definitely recommend it as it was so much fun! All of their staff was so friendly! I cannot wait to go back!"
"The cheap and good burger bar place. \n\nGem of the Atwood area. AWESOMO. \n\nI love the beef thingies like burger, steak sandwich etc etc, chicken thingy was good and fish thingy was good. Lol, I'm terrible at names, but hey they change the menu often enough. \n\nGet the sweet potato fries here, awesome dips and HOW do they make it so tasty!?!?! Just a note, the normal fries give the same goodness but are made of normal potatoes. The wasabi peas, ooooohhhhhh good. Seriously, not very spicy but full of flavor. And my newbie today, quinoa salad, WOOOHOOOOO.\n\nMy dish tonight was FANTASTIC. I've never had a better steak anywhere. I had the daily special honey and bourbon steak sandwich. Flavors were bursting in my mouth, the steak was so nice and chewy, and it has the cream cheese I love, reminding me of Bob's bad breath. mmmmm mmm mmmmmm. I usually have only half a burger, but I'm proud to say I FINISHED IT ALLLLLL.\n\nOther favorites of mine are stuffed grilled cheese and the regular menu burgers, all done really well!\n\nMy man had the pineapple BBQ ribs, the flavor was top notch, but the ribs wasn't fat enough, so it wasn't soft and chewy..\n\nBring some cash, come on by (if you forget, there's an ATM). Might be crowded, even on weekdays, but its worth the wait!!!"
"When I use to work in London, I always looked forward to having a pint at the end of the day with my friends. \n\nBesides their incredible food, Cornish Pasty has the feel that reminds me very much of an English pub. The food is the real star here, but the beers they have on tap are outstanding. \n\nOne of my favorite, is the north London brewer Fuller's Extra Special Bitter(ESB). It's fresh, tasty and took me back to the City pubs of my youth. Granted the beer back then was warmer. LOL\n\nAs we sat waiting for our server, you could see everyone was happy to be here. We sat near the bar, to the right of where the cooks are preparing the meals. Pretty soon all those dozen or so bar stools were taken. There was a lot of laughing. Folks being happy at the end of the work week and enjoying each others company. What a great atmosphere!\n\nWe started with the 20 oz/ pint of the Fuller's ($6.00) that I mentioned (photo) and glass of the Leitz Out ($6.50) Riesling. Both hit the spot nicely. \n\nFor dinner we ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty, along with the Rosemary Chicken pasty and shared some English Oven garlic chips ($3.50). I believe the chicken might have been the better of the two pasty, but not by much!\n\nBoth, had a sophisticate layering of flavors, that were subtle and very nice.  In the hands of a different Chef, you could see how the flavors might have overwhelm the palette. But not here. Surprising they were only $9.00 each. Incredible. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($6.00) and the Apple Carmel Pasty ($5.00). Both were also delicious. \n\nEach of the above items were very filling. We couldn't finish them, or the desserts. So we had four \""to go\"" boxes for later. I've posted several pictures and we really had a fun time.  Our bill came to a fair $49.07 including taxes, but before gratuities. \n\nWe'll be back. Enjoy!"
"This review is mainly about our post dining experience\n\nI called the manager to let them know that me and my boyfriend believed we may have gotten food poisoning from there the other night. We both\nfelt ill the next day, and was pretty sure it was from the 2nd morgage appetizer. It was delish- don't get me wrong, I even took pics!  \n\nAnyhow, after asking me a few questions, she asked me when was the last time I ate prior, and told her at Red Rock Buffet for breakfast. The manager then asked me \""How much did you two drink by the pool\"". We are locals here- and I was highly offended. We live in Summerlin and went there for breakfast, you can't beat a made to order  ommelette  and\n coffee for 5 bucks! So I wrote a note to corporate, and the Las Vegas General Mgr. got in touch with me and stuck up for his manager. Poor customer service, every single person I ran this by also stated this was offensive to them as well. It is a shame, it was our first experience there.\n\nI'm from Cleveland, been in the biz, and been to lots of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants in Chicago. I will not be back at any of them. I felt they treated me rudely and should have just called the health department!"
Very clean and comfortable poker room. The best in Vegas! Be sure to order the cappuccino with the swizzle stick sugar.. sooo good. Also they have all kinds of delicious drinks here :)
"Very nice place, Ate on outdoor patio. Shared a bottle of really good Riesling wine. All the food we had was very good."
We went there for happy hour. The service was super slow and it was not even busy. The food was ok.
"Over-hyped. Got here at 8:15 PM on a Saturday night for the \""Gourmet Buffet\"" and waited an hour in line.  When we finally sat down, we saw many open tables because line management is very poor (they were seating strictly in order without trying to find parties to match open tables.)\n\nFood was generally decent but unexceptional and not worth the long wait. Rack of lamb had nice seasoning but the first cut I was given was badly overcooked. \""Kobe beef\"" was a joke - it was a cheap cut of meat, tough, with no marbling, and very very salty on top. I've had real Kobe-style beef, and Bellagio's version was not even remotely close. Quail was good, if maybe a bit light on the seasoning. The rest, honestly, was not really memorable. You won't find any bold or exciting flavors here, but for the most part, the food is competently prepared.\n\nService was awful. Victor took a long time to notice that we sat down, and he didn't manage to get drinks to our table (only 2 people) until long after our first trip to the buffet.  After that, he never returned to check on us or clear empty plates. I made three trips to the buffet after finishing my drink, and I got a refill only after finally waving Victor down and giving him a dirty/questioning look.  He seemed much more interested in doting on tables with young kids than providing good service across all his customers."
Tons of classes and equipment. Indoor and outdoor pool and hot tubs. Great food in the cafe. There are saunas and all kinds of other amenities in the locker room. Can get busy during peak times.
it WAS fun...last year.. cops dont do anything outside the club but let people go usually unless they r assaulted. the fact the cops have to be outside that club says something. sooo many fights... and sum days r dead.. Thursdays was great until it started getting out of hand.. it was my fav club. it just isnt the same. what happened?
"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.\n\nAside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!\n\nWe had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.\n\nWe started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nWe ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).\n\nDaniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be \""more than a pile of onions,\"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.\n\nSo much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...\n\nThis time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that \""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell.\"" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!\n\nAnd the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.\n\nSad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident."
"The only good thing about this place was the excellent tasting and unique cocktails.  The buck stops there.\n\nI came here last night with a group of ten and although they don't take reservations they ended up reserving a large table for us, which was pretty nice of them.  All the cocktails I tried were unique and tasty but overpriced.  The sushi was really bland and nothing better then RA.  I was hesitant to try the lobster ceviche because of the whopping $21 price tag, but I figured it would be awesome and a generous portion.  When the ceviche arrived it had  three measly lettuce cups and virtually no lobster at all; the few TINY pieces of lobster I did find were tasteless.  I was so disappointed, and actually pretty pissed.  What a scam and ripoff.  I'm not a cheap person but that was just plain robbery.  I didn't even eat a full cup and didn't touch the rest; when the waitress was within earshot I commented how I didn't like the dish, but she never said a word.  I work in the food industry and you should be able to tell when a dish isn't being eaten because the customer doesn't enjoy it.  \n\nOur waitress was pretty attentive and friendly but she wasn't present very often.  The whole \""no split checks\"" thing is BS!  It is not hard to split checks and unless they hand write all orders, the P.O.S system is clearly able to do it.  Forcing groups to share one tab isn't convenient for anyone, including the server, and it just pisses people off.  Also the booths are too low for the tables are feel really awkward; good thing we were the first to arrive and got to nab the chairs!  \n\nTotal bill was $659.00 for ten people.  This place is not worth that type of money at all.  Such an utter disappointment."
My wife and I are regulars here.  Good because of the cost and availability of the produce.  Freshness also good.
"777.... that's it, you don't wanna try anything else, best steak ever. Never disappoints you..my favorite late night dinning place"
"Well, my husband and I LOVE culinary dropout ...they don't have one in Southern California yet that I know of but we usually make it a point to come here every time were in AZ. We visit family here and my husband works here so when we get the chance to come we always do. We have never been disappointed . I love the cheese platter- pretzel anything there- drinks are always spot on-. We spend usually 2-3 hours each time were there just drinking and eating till we can't move. We usually go mid day and a lot during the week which is why we've never hit a real busy time. Tonight well be going so it'll be our first nighttime visit. Can't wait - foods great and drinks are creative"
Great bartenders! Food is surprisingly good for bar food. Always enjoy my time there. A good neighborhood bar.
"I judge a Vietnamese place by its pho and pork combination rice plate. The pho was not overly seasoned and the noodles were tender and didn't stick into clumps. The grilled pork didn't have enough seasoning and garlic, but wasn't bad. Would definitely consider this as an go to place for some good Vietnamese comfort food."
"I really do just love this place...from the very first time I set foot. Unfortunately, the first time I came here, my friend and I waited for about 2 hours, but it was well worth it. I came here after watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and knew I was going to order the caramelized banana and pecan brioche French toast. How was it? Ummm...absolutely divine!!! The second time I came here, (LoL) I decided I didn't want to wait and I arrived at 6:40am. Yup, I learned my lesson the first time. FYI: These days were during the weekend...so they have a tendency to be more crowded.\nI recently went back here to bring some friends for breakfast and as always the food was great. We got everything that was featured from Food Network. =o) I wasn't too sure about the waffle dogs after watching it from Best Thing I Ever Ate because it's just a sausage in waffle batter...that you can really compare to a corn dog. I was completely wrong! The waffle dogs were so perfect! The ratio of sausage to batter was great! It was just so tasty! To be perfectly honest, we ended up having to get another order after devouring our other plates. It's a definite MUST-TRY! The dipping sauce totally caught me off guard...I think I was just expecting something sweet, but boy was I in for a little shock! It's actually a mix of Cholula Hot Sauce and maple syrup. The after shock of something spicy was a little weird, but dip the waffle dog into the sauce and it's a perfect combination! I find myself just thinking about these waffle dogs and how easy it would be to just eat them as I drive to work. *drool* The next time I come, I might just have to order 2 or 3 orders just for me (I don't want to share). LoL!"
"Le Cartet is one great place to try for breakfast with their interesting concept of boutique restaurant. Plus, they offer a wide range of products such bottled smoothies, sandwiches, salads, pastries and more. \n\nLaid-back crowd, cozy ambiance and delicious food. What can you ask for more? If the weather is great, you can even sit outside. This place definitely get off the beaten track."
"Imagine going to McDonalds for a Big Mac and finding out they've decided to only serve that particular sandwich (their most popular) once or twice a week.  That's what purchasing bread at Great Harvest Bread Company is like.  Well, no...that's what Great Harvest would be like if the girl behind the counter was flipping you off with a smile on her face at the same time.\n\nIn my opinion, their best item (besides their oatmeal chocolate chip cookies) is their loaf of Cheddar Garlic bread.  It's quite possibly the only reason why I still stop by this place anytime I'm in the area.  However, it's been a few years and I figured they may have replaced that item in that time.  So, I called one of their locations and was told that they still serve that particular bread on Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n\nThis past Saturday, my father was looking for breadbowls for a soup his wife had prepared and I suggested Great Harvest.  We walked in and each got our complimentary piece of bread by the rudest girl that I have ever been helped by.  I looked at their racks and noticed a lack of Cheddar Garlic bread.  At this point, my sister asked the same girl if they had any in the store to purchase.  She responded with a scoff...\""I only make that bread on Thursdays.\""  Trust me when I say that you informing me that this item is unavailable will hardly lead to a meltdown on my part.  What I can't handle, however, is your show of annoyance at my inquiries and complete lack of customer service.  I not only won't be back, but I'll make sure to provide any friends, business contacts or general aquaintances with an alternative business that is only too happy to treat their customers as if they're actually wanted."
"Ate here for dinner this week, I was super excited to try it because the menu looked great and I heart Tom Collicio on Top Chef, but the results were dissappointing.  \n\nPros: \nGot the domestic wagyu skirt steak, it was de-lish.  \nThe portion sizes were huge, neither me nor my friend could finish our steaks.\nWine list was good (although expensive) but not just overpriced cheap wine - the wine selections were all $16+ glasses of decent wines. \n\nCons: \nWe were not seated until half an hour after our reservation.\nGenerally slow and not very friendly service, the ambiance felt like a good old boys club.  The waiter kept walking away while we were still talking to him.\nThe side dishes were very plain.  Spinach ($12) was just that - a big pile of cooked spinach with not much flavoring.  Mushrooms ($12-16) were much the same. \nNo presentation to the food to speak of at all.  \nThe worst part about it all was that the steak was so big that it took us a while to work our way through it, and when it got cold, the oil and grease it was cooked with kind of congealed with the fatty-ness of the meat and I just couldn't eat it anymore because it tasted so oily and fatty.  If they are going to give such large portions of such fatty meat, they need to think of a way to keep it warm, or at least not let the fat congeal while you are eating it.  \nSeemed a bit overpriced for what we got."
"Wanted to start off day with a good meal, dropped by del taco never at breakfast here before. The food was fresh the service amazing. Thanks del taco for making me full and happy and ready to start day."
"If it weren't for Yelptern Izzy D and a Monroe-ish Street meeting we had scheduled, I probably would have never come across this place. Glad I did though... glad I did. \n\nI have yet to chow down so I can't speak to their eats... I'll surely nab some nosh and let you know. What I CAN tell you is that the interior is awesome. Super chill, super quirky, but super quaint, so not the place to meet 10 of your besties for coffee. There are two sides, I like the side you enter on because I think it's a bit more active and I dig the furniture sitch. Staff is so welcoming, informative, and isn't quick to rush you out if you're working for a while. Java is solid. \n\nBonus points for having live music every night 5-6. This is what their sign says, this is what their staff says, though I haven't been for tunes yet. \n\nFood and tunes anyone? Let's go!"
"Placed an order for delivery on phone at 6:45 pm. They said it would arrive in approx 45 min. 1 hour later i called them. They stated that it was on the way. Called them again at 8pm, they said so sorry, give you 50% off. Waited untill 8:30, still no food. Called them back again and told them to stuff it. VERY POOR! Would not recommend this joint to anyone. Very, very poor!"
"I love their coffee!! Any form of mocha, cappucino, etc. Gimme gimme! Happy happy girl here. They have lovely sandwiches and you know I never got to anything else but do try the high test!"
"THE best show I've ever seen.  Great for all ages, and worth EVERY expensive penny.  Its eye-popping eye-catching eye-candy.  And if you've never been to a Cirque show, its not all about clowns.  The show is a visual masterpiece.  Go go go!"
"I love this place for my shopping and their papaya salad. Although, everything they cook in that kitchen is pure magic. My family is from Cambodia and I was raised in Providence, RI while living in Connecticut. There was a heavy Southeast Asian influence in the part of Providence we often frequented. When we moved here about 8 years ago, it quickly vanished from my vision and my mother would go searching to no avail. Finally we found this wonderful gem and felt right at home with the food and the small family business appeal we were use to. I love being able to talk to the owner as i check out. They are nice and the food is authentic to the region. It reminds me of everything I grew up with."
"Spent $110 on two tickets to a Thursday afternoon show. The host was Bob Goen from Entertainment Tonight and the announcer was the guy from Supermarket Sweep. They call up 4 new people every time, if you don't have the winning bid....you're done (and get a t-shirt) and it's time to sit on down.\n\nThe first item up for bid was a cheesy looking guitar. The first lady bids $875! The lowest bid was $575. All overbid.\n\n.......lowest bid $400.....again all overbid.\n\n.....lowest bid $300.....again all overbid.\n\n.....lowest bid $250......yep\n\nFinally, someone decides to make a $1 bid. Actual retail price 200 bucks.\n\nIf that doesn't give you an idea of what kind of prizes would be in store for the rest of the afternoon, I don't know what does. It was like everyone was in denial that this show was going to be VERY watered down.\n\nThe best prize was a refridgerator. Someone played Plinko and won $50 after some very questionable pricing on some items that wouldn't allow him to get more than one chip (the most you can win at this version of plinko is $2500 with 5 chips).\n\nI kept praying that they didn't call my name during the \""instant winners\"" segment where you get 1000 Total Rewards point....which is worth 1/4 of a buffet purchase....\n\nThe games were pretty much the same as the show but the prices seemed rigged. Almost like they didn't want people to win. \n\nThe showcase showdown was confusing with almost 10 prizes being offered to the winner if they bid within $100, but only 1 being offered should they not be within $100 (a 3 day mexican cruise). You had to bid on ALL of the prizes. Here are the main prizes:\n\n-A Nissan Versa\n-Hawaiian Trip\n- Mexican Cruise\n-1000 shares of Orbitz Stock\n-TV\n\nand other things.....\n\nSomeone bid $30,000 and the other bid $27,000.\n\nActual retail price $17,000! Now you tell me how a car, two trips and 1000 shares of Orbitz is worth $17,000??? I'm telling you, it's rigged because they CANNOT afford to give things like this away on a daily basis.\n\nSave your money and go wait in line in Burbank....."
"I've never eaten here, just had a friend describe to me how he was kicked out for \""speaking spanish\"".  A bit in shock that a business in America thinks this is helpful in anyway.  If it's true then I suggest nobody eat here but Separatist douchebags."
"Five years in Edinburgh and I had never been to Palmyra; last night this little void was filled. I came here with a friend at 10pm, frustratingly everything else in town seemed closed.\n\nI ordered a small falafel (\u00a33.50) but got a 10% student discount upon showing my university card, making it a \u00a33.15 falafel! The falafel looked as though it had not been previously frozen, the hummus was clearly homemade and the wraps were like the ones you get in Lebanon. The wrap was generously packed with salad, falafel and hummus and then toasted and conveniently wrapped in tin foil and a napkin.\n\nThe lighting inside is a bit dreary, as one expects when it comes to kebab shops, so we took the wraps home. They were super tasty! Fresh, filling and tasty. I couldn't finish mine as it was so big!\n\nI will definitely be back when it need of something cheap, tasty and filling, though advise taking away!"
"Great place!  Pretty slow, as you might expect on a Monday night.  Had nice Malbec, great marinaded olives and a perfect-sized sausage and mushroom pizza.  \n\nDecor is very spiffy.  Rather hard to find the place if you're not a local.  Little strip mall right behind the tire store.  Look Arden, as it's worth searching for.\n\nGet in here!!"
Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat. If you want to take your teenager out for a shake or ice cream you may enjoy it :)
"It's a good lunch place for business meetings or dates. If you are lucky, you can sit out on the patio for an awesome view of the fountains. The interior decor is hip and contemporary with some booth seatings. \n\nUnfortunately, the food is quite disappointing. For starter, the beef carpaccio was unappetizing and the presentation was too. There's mushy beef on top of salad and polenta. It was a bit gross with a huge portion too. The mussels capellini dish was alright, but it was nothing special. The mussels were fresh though. The lunch beef sirloin is quite big, but the edges taste a bit burnt. The meat was chewy and tasted gamey. \n\nOverall, come for the potential of patio view and nice decor. The food is average at best especially for Vegas standards at top hotels."
Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.
"If you want to deal with uneducated and unprofessional loan officers, wait three months for your loan to close, miss your closing date, loose the house of your dreams and pay $2000 in originations charges, stop looking,this is definitely your mortgage broker!"
"NOT WORTH THE $$$ Had this pizza for the first time the other day at a work function. Decided I'd get one delivered. 3.9 miles away $5 out of area fee. WTF! ONE 16\"" 2 topping with a side of ranch came out to $27. That's ridiculous. Could have gotten an XL 3 topping plus 12 wings at Barro's for the same price. Will not be odering from here again."
"We went there on Christmas day, we called ahead of time to see if we needed reservations, they said no, unless you want a booth. So we reserved a booth and told them we would be there in half an hour. We arrived and no booth available, she says I see your name here, but its first come first serve, so we waited at the bar, when we were seated we ordered appetizers which were really good, but then didnt get our dinner for over an hour later. People were coming and going and we were still waiting, I complained and was told they had a party in the back room, so they were very busy. When my steak arrived it was burnt and dry, I asked for a container, I figured my dogs would like that. Worse service ever and not the friendliest place."
"Ventanto is one of my favorite dining out spots. The view is breath-taking and the staff is all so nice and accommodating. The food is always fresh and the portions are huge. I never leave Ventano without a doggie bag.\n\nI recommend the Shrimp on a Stone and the greens salad to start. As for entree, I can never decide on whether the Lasagna, chicken Piccata or Ventano Spendini are my favorites. \n\nSave room for dessert~!!! They have wonderful desserts. I love the cannoli. YUM\n\nI have been there many times since they opened and I have never had a bad meal. We were there the other night and it was great as usual...and we will be back again~!!!!"
The sushi here is very fresh and I always enjoy my meal. I would recommend to anyone in the mood for high quality sushi. Prices can be a little high for specialty rolls.
"Wanna ring in 2015 right for cheap eats?  Do yourself a favor if you already haven't - go to Red Rock Station Hotel & Casino, head over to the rewards center and sign up for a FREE Station Casinos player's card, then mosey on over to the Feast Buffet.  BAM!  World of cheap (but mostly tasty) eats!\n\nI've always heralded the Red Rock as having probably the best food out of all of the Feast Buffets Station Casinos has in Las Vegas.  Eats are plentiful, setting is modernly pretty, and the prices are more than reasonable.  I mean, if the line is long, you really can't be wrong!  I think I'm up to like 13 Yelp check ins here now, how the HELL am I not the Duke of this joint?\n\nI cannot stress enough, this Feast Buffet is no Michelin star, celebrity chef-ridden restaurant.  You won't find your fancy tomahawk ribeye steak here (lookin' at you Bacchanal), or all-you-can-drink beer & wine included (hello Studio B).  But are those fancy buffets only $16.99 for Prime Rib dinner on the weekend?  Don't think so!  Last time I wanted to eat at Caesar's buffet, I think the price went up to my first born, and the rights to a Lakers first-round draft pick.  Absurd!  What kind of silly buffet has a 'Fast Pass' line for an extra $20?  Upon which you still have to wait 2 hours to be seated?  Oi.  And a coupon for a buy one get one free buffet?!  Ha Ha!  Unless you's a balla like Jay-Z and his wifey Beyonc\u00e9-Z, fat chance.\n\nThat's not to say the food at Feast Buffet is total crap.  On many nights...OXTAIL!  Yep, Asian section.  Still one of my favorites.  Also, sushi.  Yep, not the greatest, but at least it's offered.  Pasta?  Get a plate fresh made to your liking!  BBQ Chicken pizza?  Yep, this Feast Buffet has got it.  Cauliflower au gratin?  Check.  Prime Rib on the rare?  Check.  Wedge salad with blue cheese?  Check.  Kim chee?  Check.  Pineapple Fried Rice?  Check.  Kim Chee Pineapple Fried Rice?  Check!  Actually I make that last one by mixing kim chee with the pineapple fried rice. \n\nTips from my last review of Feast Buffet still remain.  It reigns true here - breakfast at the Feast Buffet here is still the LONGEST line.  You know why?  Bargain, that's why!  Get in before 10:45 AM from M-Sat, pay the breakfast price...but stay for lunch as well!  Two meals in ONE!  Yes, this tip is for you out-of-work, college-broke folks that need some food in your belly.  By using this tip you save $2 off the bat!  But don't forget that Station Casino player's card because on average just showing the card to the cashier will save you $2-$3 a person, $5 for dinner and Sunday brunch.  Use that savings for some slots!  Or some beer!\n\nLocals in the know KNOW that the Feast Buffet in Red Rock (though there are valid arguments for Green Valley Ranch) is the place to take your extended family for a low-fuss, high-quality meal.  Look, the economy today just sucks.  Got relatives coming to town?  They want a Las Vegas buffet?  Got champagne tastes on a beer budget?  And you're expected to foot the bill?  Oh yeah, Feast Buffet here is your best bet!  Take you and your spouse and both get Station Casino player cards.  Use them a few times each over the month.  Next month?  BAM!  Coupon in the mail for each of you, buy one buffet get one FREE.  FREE = GOOD.  Just took care of four people at the buffet for the price of two.  BAM BAM!  Play enough slots and poker to use your points for a free buffet or two?  BAM BAM BAM!  PAY.  SAVE.  EAT.  LOOK LIKE HIGH ROLLER STUD.  You can thank me later."
I have been going to this place for a few years. They made a point to know my name and it gives me the warm and fuzzies! I would say everything is good except I am not a fan of cold spring rolls. I love the presentation of the pho...you get a friggen salad to make your own little creation. The mango chicken is awesome and something I crave often. They make a great Mango spicy shrimp salad that rocks with a little kick. And their Chicken fried rice has ruined me for so many others. It is so good that I can't eat it anywhere else! Great for Carryout or dine in.
"I try to avoid this airport at all costs while connecting to other destinations.  The terminals have no tram or train and are VERY far apart from each other.  On more than one occasion the people-movers have been down for repair which makes that feature even more annoying.\n\nThe bathrooms have this hallway that is only wide enough for ONE person to fit through which makes going through with bags entertaining; especially when a flight arrives and the area is crowded with passengers rushing to the restrooms.  Yes, that's \""one person\"" for both directions.\n\nThen to add to the fun there was a last minute gate change AND it took them 20 minutes to get the jet-way to the plane.  Good times."
"After 5 hours of nonstop driving from SD to Las Vegas, the fam decided to stop by the \""asian\"" area and get some food before we checked in at our hotel. Bad choice.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you are greeted with a wall of awards, recognitions, and accolades from websites and critics. I've been to a Sam Woo BBQ before, and this was uncommon. I thought it would lead to a good start, I was wrong.\n\nThose awards were issued in 2001, and boy, did they really change the restaurant till now. I ordered the roast pork and roast duck rice dish. Just to let you know, the prices for the food served here are double the price if the Sam Woo back in SD ($7-$10, Las Vegas Sam Woo $7-$20). Came pretty fast. The duck was OK, but the pork was really fatty. In fact, it was almost ALL fat. Not too good.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, ordered the Singapore noodles. While we were eating our food and finishing up, his food hasnt even left the kitchen yet. We asked if they forgot his order, and one of the waiters jus rudely replied:\n\n\""Its coming out, wait.\""\n\nAfter 10 minutes we asked again. Turned out they JUST started the order the second time we asked. The waiter didnt even acknowledge the chefs in the kitchen to see if they started. The food came, but the service spoke for itself already.\n\nNO GOOD."
"I have never written a review before but felt I needed to after my experience with Croque. We order from Croque all the time and most often have the food delivered.  In the past the food would arrive around 20 minutes later than we were told but it wasn't a big deal.  \n\nToday when we ordered we were told our food would be delivered in 30 minutes.  An hour later still no food.  My boyfriend called and the lady told him the food was on the way without even saying sorry or anything.  Another hour went by now we had been waiting 2 hours for our 30 minute delivery.  He called back and told the lady we still had not received our order.  She said it's on its way again.  He told her I hope you are not planning on charging us for this food because we have been waiting 2 hours.  In a pissed off voice she says \""Oh so you want a free meal???\""  After some arguing she said she would not charge for the food.  \n\nTwenty minutes later I received a call from the drive.  She told me her boss said not to charge for the food but demanded... \""you have to tip the driver\"" over and over again.  I told her she could talk to my boyfriend when she got here.  She then called back three more times yelling that we had to tip her.  My boyfriend told her just so you know I was going to tip you but when you deliver food 2 hours late you shouldn't call your customers and demand that they tip you.  Tipping is optional and it's based on performance.  When she got here she rang the doorbell 8 times in a row (No i'm not making this up) \n\nNeedless to say at this point we did not tip her and will no longer be ordering from Croque.  Their customer service is a Croque of $#!%.  (Sorry I had to!!!!)"
This place back in 2005 was the spot that started it all downtown. Now the last couple years it's been a joke. Drinks suck the crowd is pretty bad too.
"I have stayed here on 2 different occasions and I must say both experiences were beyond anywhere else I have stayed on The Strip.  From the high-tech room, the cleanliness everywhere you look, to the staff and the food choices available, it's hard to think of any place on the Strip that beats Aria.  I brought family with me who had never been to City Center yet on this last trip and they were very impressed with the casino and amenities.  My husband says he thinks the Poker Room here is awesome as well.  Upon walking into this casino the very first time, I sort of didn't like it because it didn't look like any of the other casinos.  But as I kept coming back, I started to feel the energy and really enjoy myself here. The architecture and artwork around the entire property is amazing to look at, very different from any other Vegas casino.  The staff are excellent. Had the pleasure of having drinks at 3 of the bars and although they were pricey, they were delicious.... hey, you're in Vegas!  I especially love the beds/ mattresses and pillows they have in the rooms.  I was thisclose to buying pillows on this trip but I'll probably do that next time.  The vanilla scent when you first walk into the lobby can be somewhat annoying but I enjoy it and you can also purchase the vanilla scent sticks there to take home.  I will continue to book a room here in the future whenever I will be in town.\n\nI did have some trouble here and there with the wifi on my iphone, but hey, no biggie.  That doesn't take away from the sheer beauty of this place :D"
I had the house special chow mein to-go for 8.10.\n\n- a bit better than panda express. pretty bland. \n- small portion for the price. few meat for their combo\n- 8.10 for chow mein and their AYCE dinner is10.50? bad pricing. \n- i have to come back to try AYCE. eating individual platters aren't worth it.
"My mom and I came here for coffee and sweets after enjoying a nice breakfast at Joes Farm House. As we walked in we were overcome by the delicious coffee aroma! It was my moms birthday so she picked out a beautiful looking expresso cupcake. I asked the women working the register what I should get and she picked out a coconut cookie thing, I don't really remember what it was called. But it was GREAT. Coconut is my favorite and it also had chocolate chips in it! I also order some chai tea. It was so lovely and refreshing! \nAll in all, this place is a perfect for a nice, relaxing morning with a cup of coffee and tasteful pastry."
"first paintball experience ever for a company event and i got tore up.\n\nthe pain is addicting after awhile.  at first you're just like #(#$#($#@)*$$#&*, then after the initial shock wears off you're like yeaaa, battle wounds bitch!\n\nmy review could be biased as i don't have much to compare too, but the staff was really helpful, and knew what they were doing.  the place is quite huge.  i was told there would be a concession stand, but it wasn't open at the time we went.\n\ni have been wearing my bruised ass body with pride.\n\nwill definitely do again!"
"Expect at least five flies flying around. Service has really gone downhill in the last year. Place is dirty and food quality is terrible. Previously they would offer their lunch special, now they try to push their regular menu on lunch patrons to make an extra buck. No longer one of my favorite Vegas restaurants. Never returning after last visit, lady owner was so rude. Eat at your own risk."
"The 5 start rating is for the Oxtail Soup.  I've been eating this soup for the past 13 years.  After driving 5 hours from San Diego to Las Vegas, I make a stop to eat oxtail before I do anything else.  They only serve it around 11pm -9am.  You get a big bowl of several oxtail bones in broth, with carrots, celery, peanuts and chinese mushrooms.  It comes with 2 scoops of steamed rice and a little ground ginger and minced cilantro which you add to your soup once you get it.  Kinda like adding basil leaves and bean sprouts in your bowl of pho.  On weekend nights, the line is 20-30 mintues long depending on when you get there.  It's worth the wait."
"Mandarin Bar has the glamour of the old Vegas: WITHOUT slot machines, huge plastic novelty frozen margarita cups, it has a sense of greater intimacy, and a fab view. The ambience, decor and the cocktails - being made with fresh and more unusual ingredients - are worth the price tag. I had two different cucumber cocktails, and both were refreshing and delicious. Service was good too - friendly and unobtrusive - although we did have to ask twice for water. I would be giving 5 stars for overall experience but the food was not so great. pork belly was tough (but sauce was tasty) and the waffle fries were a bit soggy. perhaps chef was having an off-night. Everything else: A+."
"Go for the Salt n Pepper Shrimp, fried chicken wings, cocktail shrimp, snow crab legs, raw oysters, greens, and fish... they also have clams, mussels, crawfish... the kids love this place.  We always print out the 10% off coupon online.  For all the seafood thats offered, it's better than your average chinese/asian buffets around town..."
"ASU online is a SCAM! The advisors are lazy, the registration department is unorganized. They don't document things as they should. They don't return phone calls as they should and when you call them out they b/s and say \""your phone number on file is wrong....\"" or \""is this your number....\"" and read the WRONG number... i literally had that happen to me more than 2 times and EVERY TIME I updated the number but somehow it ended up being \""wrong\"" AGAIN! They make mistakes and don't take responsibility for them.. somehow it's always the students fault. They register classes on your behalf WITHOUT you knowing.... then expect you to pay for it. If you don't, they send it to collections. if I could honestly give ASU a lower rating I WOULD! THINK TWICE BEFORE APPLYING TO THIS SCHOOL!!! Horrible... horrible... horrible. It's more a business than a university. At the end of the day all they care about is your money."
"Loved it!\nVery nice place for a Sunday afternoon lunch.\nSweet and sour chicken was very tasty.\nEverything was fresh and HOT!\nGreat value,lots of food for the money. Has lunch menu every day.\nWill return for sure."
"A few years ago, I came to outback almost every week.  Their food was amazing and I love their complimentary bread that they give.  But then they started to go down-hill.   The food was cutting it anymore and the service wasn't as great as I remembered it to be.  So, I stopped going to outback for about three years.\n\nBUT now, wow they changed their menu and added/removed a few items as well.  I was impressed!  They no longer have my favorite sinful sydney sundae, but they added milkshakes. Oh man was that AMAZING. I ordered the cappuccino milkshake, it is my new favorite dessert! It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't too powerful with the cappuccino.  It was just perfect. I am craving it as I am typing this review.\n\nThe entree was good, I ordered the half-order of baby back ribs.  It was tender and juicy.  I did not like the fries that much, but I was already full from the two complimentary breads that I ate and an appetizer. \n\nAppetizer, we ordered the steak nachos thing, it was interesting. The nachos or \""chips\"" was really good, but I feel like they didn't add enough steak on it.  \n\nService - he was a great and friendly server.  He seemed busy, but he kept all of us content and no complaints at all.  \n\nI think I am in love with outback again!"
"I hate to give 1 star, so 2 will do. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here for dinner around 6:00 on a Sunday evening, it looked a little busy so the 10 minute wait for a booth sounded great! The manager apologized and I assured him we were fine with that.\n\n \nFirst, the poor hostess was so lost and confused,  she was wondering around looking so stressed out trying to help buss tables, looked like her first job. The busser was no where to be found I only saw him twice the whole night, it almost seemed as if he was washing dishes and didn't have time to buss. The whole night we sat with the last tables dirty cups and dishes stacked above our head at the booth.\n\nSecond, Our bartender was our server so I expected a little wait, no one brought us bread until we asked, and when brought out it was just thrown on the table, no oil was served or anything,  nobody even introduced themselves. Meanwhile,  our order went in at 6:20 at 6:50 our main dish was served, it looked as if it was sitting on the counter for 15 minutes and a little cold, but wasn't to big to complain so we just asked for some extra sauce to moist it back, by 7:10 the extra sauce was delivered as well as our appetizer salads... My boyfriend has order the chicken parmesan,  he asked for bowtie noodles and unfortunately got thick string noodles.\n\nHey my pinapple mojito was delicious!!\n\nFinally, our check was brought out our bartender apologized for the horrible service he knew was served and comped everything from our bill except  our salads, I was thankful.\n\nI wanted to add a server in particular,  unfortunately I do not know his name, but I made sure I went out of my way to thank him for everything because he was the one making sure we ordered, our food was delivered, our condiments were brought out, refilled waters, he basically did everything, defiantly the only one who could hold his composure at a busy rate."
"We had a second gift certificate to use, so we went back, for lunch this time and stuck to the mainstream of the menu with a pork chimichanga and a pork burrito, both of which were enormous and pretty good."
"Plenty of good time here\n\nMiller Ale House is situated in the Town Centre shopping and entertainment complex.\n\nThis place is a tight sports bar that has great food for lunch and dinner to boot. The Ale house has all your draft and bottle needs with a decent range of 50 to 90 beers at one time.\n\nI recommend the wings while watching some hockey or basketball. They use to have moose drool beer which is my jam but they unfortunately took it off the menu.\n\nThe service here is always decent and beer is cold. I don't have any real complaints other than the location kinda of caters to tourist market, if they opened in Summerlin somewhere it would an awesome local hang out spot for sure"
"This is some of the best chain restruant pizza I have ever had! The price is great and they have great deals also. The pizza is far better than Papa John's and doesn't even compare to Pizza Hut - Some places like Villia Pizza and Roma Pizza have just as good pizza. Don't let the two past reviews sway your descion - This pizza is great and a great vaule, I have to drive 10 miles to go pick my pizza - Its worth it!"
"I love this place! It's not always the quickest because apparently everyone else loves this place too lol but I don't mind waiting because once I'm actually in the room to see the doc, he's pretty efficient and straight to the point. They take culinary insurance and bill it as a general practitioner instead of an actual urgent care or ER which saves me 50-130 so that's another plus! They also have their own pharmacy for cheaper than or the same price as my pharmacy."
Im not from this area so when I come around Phoenix I always have to stop at a Jersey Mikes since there are very few in So Cal.  I can't wait till they open more where I live cause you can tell the quality is unmatched compared to Subway and Quiznos.
"I write this as I sit awaiting for my food.  I've been waiting for an hour now.  At a table with 10 other people, and the food is brought out 1 or 2 at a time.  This will be my last visit."
"Great selection of flicks, but management refuses to hire enough staff to man ticket window. Got here 15 minutes before start and couldn't buy tix in time. Line for tix machine ultra long too. No respect for customers."
Never have I ever gone to a place paid my money then ask for it back!! The food in this place is so bad I wanted it back. Ok first of all while waiting in line I was looking around and was liking the decor and the seating arrangements the red rock has got to be the best casino for foot traffic. But the people they hire to prepare the food needs improvement. Let's start with the Asian section think of the worst Asian buffet place you have been to. It's still better the stuff they try to call Asian food here. (I'm not the only one who thinks so cause when I sat down to try it my self an Asian couple had left their plates full of the food from the Asian) Now the American food they had macaroni and cheese that I regretted getting the butterfly shrimp they had was ok needed a little ingredient known as salt. Everything their could have used some salt. There was no flavor in anything other than the soft serve ice cream I got. They don't even know how to make Italian food it's really disappointing. I wouldn't give it any stars but the decor and atmosphere give it one star. Red Rock employees if your reading this you need somebody to come and show the people in the Feast how to cook because what they are doing now is insulting. Just because it is a buffet doesn't mean putting out crap is acceptable.
"This company moved us from San Tan Valley, AZ, to Prescott Valley, AZ, in September, 2014.  Most of the move went well.  When we hit a few rough spots and some damages,  the owner, Derek, stepped in immediately, kept his word on all repairs, and stuck to the original moving estimate - even though it was off by a more than small amount.  Rare to find a moving company this ethical.  We won't hesitate to recommend them to our friends."
"This resort is attached to the ghost town inspired village at Lake Las Vegas. This review is of our recent 2 night stay over the past weekend.\nStaff at the front desk were professional and polite. But that is about were the positive experience ends. Our room was clear across the property in the Luna building. After the drive we were looking forward to some time in the hot tub, but the Luna's pool area was closed due to a leak. Leaving a 6-7 minute walk across property to the other pool, which closed at 5, out of the question.\nThe room was nicely appointed with a kitchenette and had dishes which was nice, along with a small outdoor patio. The building is very loud and poorly insulated against sounds. Our door would rattle as if someone was trying to get in every time our neighbor would close theirs. Plumbing would bang and squeal throughout the night, you could hear the elevator 'ding' and people walking down the hall having a conversation sounded like they were inside your room. The wife and I both struggled to get any good sleep on both nights we stayed here. The front desk had relayed that they were at 100% capacity for the weekend when we checked in so I knew a phone call to them would have gone no where.\nResort fee of $23/night seemed outrageous but I guess is the going rate these days. They said it covered parking, but then said parking was first come first serve and for the Luna building that meant parking up the street and walking in because parking filled up quick.\nBottom line: We will find elsewhere to stay next time we're in the area."
I literally hate this place because their donut holes are so delicious and addicting! I moved into an apartment down the street and now I have to drive by it everyday... Haunting my dreams with delicious donuts
"My favorite dish here is the tuna pizza. It was recommended as the most popular dish here and they did not disappoint. I already am a fan of truffle oil, so I knew this dish had to be good. The kobe beef tataki just bursted with flavor in your mouth. I also tried the sushi with the pop rocks which the name in itself already caught my attention. I think it's a cool concept but I personally did not like the sweetness from the pop rocks mixed with the sushi. I do appreciate the chef's creativeness in this. Overall, very good experience here, not to mention the beautiful backdrop of the Bellagio water show in the background at night."
"Mediocre food with poor service.  Management cares little about customer service as was reflected by the attitude I encountered when I flagged the manager down no less than three times to get water, clean silverware and salad dressing, which my wedge was served without.\nI am sure that corporate management would be very troubled by the situation at this restaurant.\nI was visiting Pittsburgh for the week, I frequent the Columbus location, it's quite different in quality and a huge difference in service.  \nI would not recommend this restaurant under any circumstances."
"Ok, so I finally found this place!  Tucked away in a little strip mall across from some car dealerships, its a great little find.  I noticed that they have great hours here, open early and late at night as well.\n\nThe seating here is great.  Could accomidate a group as long as its not super busy, and they seem to have a decent menu of sorts.  I really like this place, and the guy at the counter who helped me was nice and funny.  Worth a stop to grab some coffee, read the paper, or surf the internet."
"I'm here at least every other week for a gel manicure and often for a pedicure too.  Sarah H and I often come together because a pedicure is more fun with a friend.  The salon is clean and well organized and beautifully designed.  The nail techs are always friendly and very accommodating.  I've been coming here almost exclusively for the last two years and I'm happy I discovered it,"
"I'm a fan of this resort. Friendly people, good value, nice pool and having free water and internet (even though it is wired) is really nice since I was using this trip for dual purpose. My son and his friend went to 3 different golf courses (all great central location) and I worked from the hotel during the day. It was comfortable - was able to use the little patio out front of the room or the desk as a mini office. \n\nI wish they were able to keep the use of the personal hot tubs in the suite I stayed. I guess they've come under some regulation for this so they've closed all of them - it would have been awesome to have use of that in my back patio! \n\nThe room needs a little renovation, but it is clean and spacious. What mattered to me for this trip."
"I remember when I heard this place was opening, I was stoked. At last, there was to be a non-chain fine dining restaurant on the West side. It only took a year and half for me to go there. I justify this lapse as giving them plenty of time to get the kinks out.\n\nIn order to beat the noise and crowds, we went for an early dinner on Friday. Our server was very amiable and polite, but I'm not entirely sure of his knowledge of the restaurant's products. \n\nUpon looking at the menus, I must agree with the previous reviewer who stated that the dishes offered were uninspired. There were several items that looked good, but none that I felt were \""must try\"" or innovative. \n\nI was pleased to see several classic cocktails on the drinks menu. However, when I ordered one, it was made improperly. This seems to be the common theme with Skye -- they aim high, but miss the mark.\n\nWhen the appetizers arrived, I thought they were like Applebee's-type offerings, but made with fancier ingredients (e.g. the duck and brie quesadilla). The coconut shrimp tasted like something out of the freezer.\n\nThe shrimp in my entree were woefully overcooked, at the risotto did not taste of tequila or cayenne, as the menu promised. My companion's steak was rather good, but her mashed potatoes looked like plastic, and tasted odd, as if maybe they contained parsnips or turnips. It's no surprise that we did not stay for dessert.\n\nI am torn, because I thought the food was so blah. Yet selfishly, I want Skye to succeed, in the hopes that more restaurants will want to make a go on the West side."
"Worst Costumer service ever!!! After being on the phone for over an hour, the Representative says, \""Are you sure you have our service?\"" and then I'm \""disconnected\""!!!  Try again, start over with someone who doesn't speak English, says he will have to call me back- 1 week still waiting!  \nAlso, bill went from $37 to $67 - new Rep says to \""Cancel\"" WOW! GREAT idea!!\n\nI Give  Negative 5 Stars"
"Ok food, but this Ohioan wasn't impressed. Clean inside, and nice bathrooms though."
"Stopped here on a layover. Wanted to try something different than the normal fast food places. Ordered Mongolian beef, which was WAY too salty... The broc was under cooked and the chow mein just tasted like spaghetti! \nDon't go here!"
"I have curly hair, so I am always cautious about where I get my hair cut. Alice at the Willy St. location is awesome! She has given me great cuts, and she's fun to chat with. I had let about 5 months go by in between my haircuts, and she remembered me. I was impressed."
"A couple doors down from Ichiza, this place is a cool little Korean pastry shop to buy pastries, eat a pastry there, chill with a cup of coffee, or talk with friends. There isn't a great abundance of seating, but I've never had trouble finding room. \n\nThey sell fresh pastries, wedding cakes, and also cake confections like tiramisu. \n\nI've had their mochi bread (bun with azuki bean mochi inside; $3), yummy. Their fried mochi is good, too. But the thing to write home about is the Mammoth bread. It's A huge flat pastry with azuki bean and butter cream inside ($15). Feeds me for a week and a half."
"Ummm...Lainie B. or Larnia B. needs to take this rating as constructive criticism and do something about it, instead of calling me names and posting it on Yelp. If you can't handle the criticism, hunny, learn to give good service. I guess Man vs. Food did a good job featuring the crawfish, but not the employees!"
"This is one of my favorite Madison restaurants.  The best part are all the delicious Belgian beers on tap.  You can try all sorts of different flavors and be amazed by them all.  In addition the food is very delicious.  The menu is small but they do everything on it well.  I had a special which was a sliced sirloin on top a parmesan potato puree, which was amazing.  I have also had lunch there which is cheaper and still very good.  The place is small so it is sometimes hard to get a seat, but it also makes it quite cozy.  The only problem is the service can be a bit slow.  You just have to flag waiters down to get things.  Overall a great restaurant."
"I find their instructor's voices, speech cadence and pseudo-spiritual narrative to be awfully annoying. I would rather they just allow some silence in the class. But, it is a good workout, not too expensive...and I suppose it's good practice to learn to learn to tune it out."
"Nothing new at this place, they continue to remove the expiration dates\noff their food products. Someone needs to alert the clark county health department!!!"
Dr Rusick is awesome! I was having chronic neck and upper back pain when one of my friends referred me to him. After just a few appointments I was feeling much better.  Dr Rusick will listen to what is bothering you and will come up with a plan to help your problem.
"I'm pissed. How can you just stop making grilled cheese? Its bread and cheese. HOW? You have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?\n\nAlso, why does it have to be 400 degrees? I know you have A.C. This is AZ in the summer. It's hot. Turn it on.\n\nI don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because I rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst I have ever tasted. I had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.\n\nYour tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. At least you have that going for you."
"Went back two nights later after my boyfriend and I ran a race in Boulder Dam and one of the bar managers was there. We had a fantastic night! They had a great selection of beers on the list and we stayed for hours. I again got the fried cheese curds. A-MAZING! \n\nI have no idea what this soapy glass business that people complained about. I didn't see a single one.\n\nThis is definitely a hike from the strip but it is by far the best beer selection we saw in Vegas. Also, the prices are very reasonable and you can get a good beer, with an actual taste, for the price of crappy beers on the Strip."
"Yea this is definitely a 4.5. I'd give it a 5 but I haven't rated a \""best\""yet. Simply the most unique sushi I've had including Koi. The 2 reviews have to be from competitors that are envious. Roberto was waiter who was funny gracious and had great recommendations. Save room for dessert. I didn't but had lava cake and chocolate cup. Everyone voted cup the best. One of my top five Restraunts in Vegas. Back to LA"
"Service was good, and the place was big and clean.  They have so much competition in town, and the food was greatly lacking. Prices were not cheap for the lousy food my group had. I will not be back."
"Hands down the best meal I've had in Vegas... perhaps the best meal I've had period.\nFirst the ambiance. It's quite unique and spectacular. The details, the colors, the flowers, the chandelier... it all comes together beautifully and works very well for Vegas.\nNext, the service -  spectacular. Best service I've ever had. This is the problem I have with a lot of SF restaurants (read: Zuni Cafe, Sebo...). Just because you have good food doesn't mean you can slack on the service. Well Joel Robuchon does not disappoint. We had numerous people come by and explain different meals, options, etc. over the course of the night and our main waiter was phenomenal. Sweet, well spoken, knew all the dishes and gave great recommendations.\nThe food - wow. Started with a caviar and crab dish. It was amazing. We started dinner close to 11 pm so didnt have time to do the 16 course tasting menu... must come back for this. I ordered the salmon tartar. Presentation was stunning and tasted very very good.  I had the duck and foie gras for my main course and it was by far the best duck I have ever had. Combining it with the fruit and foie gras made the dish amazing.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate souffle, some apple or pear dish and then they sent out another dessert (pineapple I think?) because it had taken a while to seat us. Again, all were amazing. But separate from the actual courses, I would have been content with the bread and chocolate cart alone! The bread cart was phenomenal...so many good ones (favorites include the milk bread and bacon bread). And then after the dessert, the chocolate cart! Dream come true! There were sooo many different choices the waiter lost me after the 5th thing... I think there were 40 or 50 different types of chocolates, macaroons, marshmellows etc. they make inhouse. I asked him to recommend his favorites and he did a great job of picking (as he had down with the breads).\nAnd finally, they sent me home with a full bag of chocolate for the next day. They were not at all stingy about how many chocolates I could have that night and gave me a decent number to take home.\n\nOverall, couldn't have asked for more. One of the most memorable meals I've ever had and can't wait to return and try the 16 course menu. In the last 2 weeks I've had the opportunity to eat at a lot of great restaurants (Pierre Gagnaire's new place in the Mandarin, Okada, Eleven Madison, Jean George, Le Bernadin, Gilt...) and this was by far the best meal and experience and that is a pretty high bar of competing establishments. Wouldn't have changed a thing."
Usually a good selection of brew .. Mostly California and other West Coast breweries. Food above average.  \nService tonight was very good but I have been there when it's slow.\nWe'll be back.
"4 Stars??? Really people?? This place was horrendous! The only reason I ended up stopping by this place was because my grandma wanted to go to an older casino near the strip.\n\nWe parked up stairs and ended up taking the elevator down. As soon as I got in the elevator it stunk like 1950's old cigarettes and mold. When we got down to floor level, I was unimpressed. Now I know why they shut places like this down... they are an EYE SORE!\n\nI was told that they are going to remodel it or tear it down, whichever they choose, please choose it soon!\n\nI saw all the reviews of people who enjoy the cheap beers. If you want at a free beer, sit as a bar and put a dollar in the machine and get one. I ended up going to the bar and ordering one (I didn't have anymore cash to play the machines) and they charged me $16 for a double Jack and Coke. Ridiculous! \n\nAlso I wanted to play the $5 black jack and the tables were full the entire time I was there. And not to mention the stupid lines for the half price show tickets. Can't this half price tickets get their own booth or location?\n\nGO ELSE WHERE! THIS PLACE STINKS, LITERALLY!!"
"Another upgrade...i couldn't understand why this place was rated so high and i had such a mediocre visit. after a very positive interaction with the owner i decided to give 'em another go. glad i did, they deserved it. Maybe everything was a little moister and tastier, or maybe my state of mind was a little better but i had a positive experience.  i will say the wedding cake is very good. it is what you would expect! the place is still clean, still friendly people behind the counter. stop by for a slice if you are in the area. i understand they will do a whole cake for you as well...."
It's always surprising to find yourself on the wrong side of the zeitgeist.  Such is my experience with Mary Coyle.  I've gone to MC several times over the last couple of months and only one time could I bring myself to actually sit down.  The place is filthy.  On top of that unpleasantry the bus staff is likely to be found smoking in the back parking lot while un-bussed tables piled with half eaten sundays and used napkins run amok.  The last two times I visited there was a strong and very obvious sewer issue.  How people can eat here is beyond me.  Maybe I was just unlucky and my three experiences were not the norm.  I certainly hope so but I can't bring myself to give them a fourth chance.
"... as always, 5 stars if the place would stand up anywhere. It would. \n\nFirstly, I'm overjoyed it survived these past few years. Secondly, on a regular Saturday night 8:30-ish, it was 40% full - and in-line with it's 2 street-facing co-tenants. That's hopefully enough to ensure survival. These 3 delightful restaurant/bars have carved out a wonderful second life for the industrial building they're housed in and provide a luxury of urbanity to this burg. \n\nWe had to scoot in for a quick small supper before going to a comedy show a friend was in. Small check quickly and un-resentfully served - thank you gracious server! \n\nThere was a single man drinking a coke and eating a bowl of pasta at the bar while diligently reading his book. It was clear he felt abundantly welcomed. That tableau epitomizes the civilized urbane establishment this place is. \n\nThe pasta carbonara remains true after two years to the unremittingly high standard set for me by a Queens neighborhood Italian joint decades ago - and Pasta Bar remains the only other place I've ever ordered it more than once. For that, and so much more, I'm eternally grateful."
"I like Red Robin. \n\nThere, I said it. I've never had a bad waiter experience and the food has always been just what I've expected. \n\nBig ups to this location though. My group made a reservation for 60 people for lunch yesterday. I called an hour or so before our time to ask if it was cool if we came in a little early, and apparently there was a mix-up with the days because they thought we were coming in the following day. What could have been a huge disaster was not because they quickly accommodated us and after about a 5-minute wait we were all seated in the dining area. They had no problem splitting checks, our food came out at a reasonable time, drinks were filled, great experience."
The dine-in theater at AMC is the PERFECT place to take a date.  With dine-in experiences being 18+ there are no children running around.  The food is the same price as a Chili's and they bring it right to your seat while you enjoy the feature.  I'm definitely going back!
This place is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. The Panang curry is so good (even my husband who is not a fan of curry loves it)! And their Tom Kha Kai is amazing. Other favorites are the fried rice and Pad See Ew with beef. \n\nThe service is prompt and friendly.
Went there this weekend.  The employees are operating under the directive that they are there to train the CUSTOMERS.  Customers at this Paradise are to not ask for too much and to do everything so the high schooler employees don't have to do too much.  \n\nMy neighbor had warned us about this Paradise location....but we took relatives who were staying near at Gainey Ranch... mistake.
"In a word WOW! came here after reading the other yelp reviews and all I can say is I am glad I did. I had the salmon special and it was really good the fish was nice and fresh not some frozen patty like the food chains, the potatoes were real and so was the spinach. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I am not a big micro brew guy and when I asked what they had they just point to a giant chalk board in the back. When you have over 20 micro brews on tap a little help would have been nice. I didn't ask for help nor did they offer so you can take that one as you want.\nHow can you beat a killer Salmon dinner and a couple of beers for 26 Bucks?"
I love Aloha Animal Hospital!  They have been so friendly and accommodating!  Every time I go in I feel very comfortable to talk to Dr Zimmerman about any questions or concerns I have and she is always very thorough in explaining and answering any questions.  They are so sweet to my pups and always leave a chocolate for us humans! Love love love them!
"As a wandering tourist my expectations were good location and cheap price. Perhaps the \""hotel\"" title is confusing but it's more comfortable than a hostel. \nMy room was clean but humidity was a problem, the single rooms are in the basement. \nThe staff are friendly. However the internet connection is very slow from all floors and you should not expect the continental breakfast to keep you full."
"i didn't know cheesecake could actually inspire joy until i experienced the dark chocolate and chile arizona cheesecake company cheesecake at the main ingredient on 7th street and sheridan. \n\nspeechless, really, which means this review will be short and sweet. in short, you haven't lived until you've tried it. and sweetly, spicyrichchocolatecreamcheesiness just doesn't get any better than this.\n\nbrilliant, i tell you. simply brilliant.\n\neat a piece for me.\n\nlola"
"There was nothing remarkable about this place.  We went on a Saturday night and it was DEAD.  We were running late so we called and asked if they could hold our reservations for 30 minutes.  The hostess said that they were packed and they could only hold it for 10 minutes.  We rushed from our hotel, only to find that the place was dead! There was plenty of seating indoors and outdoors.  Our server was nice, but the service was slow.  The food was average.  From what I hear, the Pink Taco in LA is much better and tons of fun."
"Common Market has soooo many great reasons to visit! It's a great place to:\n\n-Take friends visiting the city (it's a community staple)\n-Have a cool brew\n-Get a delicious sandwich (haven't had a bad one yet...although the last time I went they forgot to add bacon to my sandwich so double check your order before leaving)\n-Write your next blog post...or is that just me:)\n\nThe staff is easy like Sunday morning. Come to chill and be sure to stop by when they have tastings and live music (ck out their site for details). It's totally worth it and with the oh-so-not-common atmosphere, you'll always something new to try!"
"Ugh.  So Bloom is owned by Food Lion--except Bloom is the non-ghetto version that was meant to compete with Harris Teeter.  The problem is that some brainiac at the Food Lion corporate office decided that Bloom was no longer to be.  Thus--all Blooms are now Food Lions.  This location has been undergoing the ghettoization to turn it from a pleasant market-style layout to a straight forward aisle by aisle grocery store.  It's almost like they've strategically placed dirt and goop to give it that Food Lion feel.  I'll be shopping at the Harris Teeter up the road from now on.  Sad, because Bloom was such a great palce."
"This Subway was hopping the night my friend and I were here. It was before the Carly Rae Jepsen/Hot Chelle Rae concert downtown and a local high school dance, and the employees were bum rushed. We went at the perfect time, just before all the high school kids flocked in. Our service was fast and spot on. The food was excellent and right on the money."
"Veggie Delight very great cooking and good flavor foods, fresh and clean.\nI love it."
"This was the most awful teppanyaki place I've ever been to!  Not only was it dead empty, which made for an awkward situation every time someone spoke, but the food was horrible!  \n\nThe salmon tasted very fishy and definitely not worth $32!  The portion of steak was tiny and dried out. Even the terriyaki sauce was bad...  How do you screw up terriyaki??  Fried rice had no taste either...\n\nWill never return. I definitely recommend against this place!!"
This is my second time at the Wynn buffet.  It is a shame that the first time was so much better.  My main complaint is that crab legs were TINY.  It is definitely nowhere near king size.  Maybe times are tough and buffets are trying to cut cost.  I was fairly disappointed by the crab legs because thats what I look forward to eating at buffets.  I did like the lambchops though. The dessert and salad bars were acceptable.\n\nThe manager was a jerk.  He gave us a really hard time when we tried to sit together.
"Usually I LOVE MC but today was NOT one of those tumes. Shepherds pie has too hot to eat..way too hot..the Caesar salad was filled with brown lettuce,  the dressing was sour and my pumpkin pie was burnt and tough. My server was nice but inattentive.  I was SO looking forward to eating here but spent way too much money on..well basically apathetic foid and service.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT"
Worst bank/cu I've ever used. Fees for everything!! They're just crooks trying to rip off hard-working people.
"Everyone is very friendly & welcoming and they don't try to \""upsell\"" you as much as some other places.  They always give me a bottle of water too, which is a nice touch.  Will continue coming here for sure."
"Avocados here are hands down the BEST in Gilbert. Granted, at $3 a piece, they sure better be, but non the less they are always perfection. The cashiers on the other hand, are not as appealing. It's as if they are being held there against their will and taking it out on the customers. They need a customer service seminar to teach them it's okay to be friendly. If the avocados weren't so good, I would never deal with those grumps again."
"MGM might have the finest poker room ever with the most charismatic dealers and the best Manager in the business(Mr.Boyd). But, they got a real problem at the rest of the casino and hotel. \n\nLast year reservations made a crucial mistake that cost me about $100. I made a reservation for a Saturday, and even told the agent that I wanted the room for SATURDAY and she confirmed the numerical date as well. When I arrived on Saturday, they had no reservation for me. The front desk agent who had a thick Eastern European accent was in a rotten mood due to the guests who she serviced before me being very out-of-line and difficult. She was still steaming when I got to her and she had abandoned all of her customer service and hospitality skills. Eventually, she had found out that the reservation agent had made my reservation for Friday. I insisted that it was mistake and she shouts: \""WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING THIS TO ME TODAY?\"". I could have interpreted the \""you people\""  remark as a racist remark, but didn't know if that comment was due to the fact that English didn't appear to be her first language. Eventually she told me that she was not going to charge me for a no-show on Friday and that she could check me in. That turned out to be a complete lie. I didn't catch it until recently, but I was looking though some bank statements and noticed that she in fact did charge me as a no-show. \n\nThe casino floor is not that much better. I played blackjack for 4-6 hours a day, betting about $50 a hand for about two weeks in a row here, and my rewards card still has a comp balance of $0.00. I believe that this is one of those casinos where they do that Vegas style \""age discrimination\"". Many Vegas casinos do not like to comp young people who are in their 20s, no matter how big they bet. They like to comp the geriatrics and seniors even though they may only play penny slots. There is no real rational reason why they do this but remember that since the corporations took over Vegas, they have been losing revenue due to their marketing department being full of unqualified pretty girls and trust fund babies whose Dad's had connections to get them in. \n\nI still would like to point out that the people who work at the gift shops are very nice and polite, and the dealers are all very qualified to work at such an upscale establishment. But, next time I have guests in town who I want to impress, I will absolutely never check them in at the MGM."
"So far the only thing I have eaten at Verde that was not awesome was breakfast. Don't get me wrong it was yummy, but lunch or dinner is much better here. My favorite dish is the tacos al fresco. Two fresh tortillas loaded with fresh colorful veggies and coated in a delicious vinaigrette. Did I mention everything is super fresh? The rice and beans are also very good. The salsas and guacamole are also awesome. One is smoky while the other has great tang and spice. Nothing, however, outshines their delicious tortillas. I love walking by and seeing someone preparing them in the window. The decor and atmosphere are also great. The owners are super nice too. I really can't complain about this awesome place!"
They don't have the usual great subway service that you would expect from a subway. Ive been in multiple tines and employees have not had a uniform. No great and they are mean when attend to you. I recommend the service at jersey mikes better.
"While I definitely agree with the reviews that say the matzo ball sucks, I still enjoy the large portions and generally good sandwiches here.  I usually go here after work (11pm or so) when there's no line or anything so its fine."
"Both Parasol Up and Down are great places to go to in order to start a night. I usually go there with friends before hitting one of the clubs at Wynn/Encore or while counting down the time to a reservation at one of the many restaurants at Wynn/Encore. I prefer Parasol down because it's slightly quieter and has a more personal feel, Parasol Up however is open later and is more accessible (not sure if its 24 hours though). In addition to this, both bars have a great selection of spirits to choose from, including brands that aren't available at other higher end bars including Death's Door Gin."
"Went back after last being in Las Vegas a few years ago and discovering this place. I didn't remember the name so we just went to the one with the highest yelp ratings and we were so excited to see we had hit it!Great mango lassis, seems like everyone in the restaurant was drinking them! And the staff is very friendly! Food excellent. We wanted to come back the next day for the buffet but we had so much leftovers we made our own buffet in our room!"
These people have no idea what to sell you. They just point to the startup boxes when I could have saved money buying better items separately. No knowledge on reptile health. Also sold me a turtle with one eye. Really?
"omg this place was reeediculously gorgeous! i felt like i had walked into some adult version of raging waters/candyland. seriously, i wanted to play with all the little water contraptions they had, like this stripper pole that showers water on the girls underneath. and this overflowing mini-pool with see-thru sides (VIP tables only i think :(). it was *the* most perfect sunday ever! blue skies, 90 degrees in august, lots of space around and in the pool to sit down, lots of shade, easy-access and clean bathrooms, beautiful people everywhere. i am *so* bummed i did not buy a new bikini for this and put on some heels :("
"I am updating a review here.  The Cupcakery is a great place to stop if you're heading to sombodys house for some dinner, party, event , whatever, and want to pick up something so as not to arrive empty handed.  Perfect to send for get wells, thank yous etc.. hip, tasty...and who doesn't dig cupcakes?  And..... I just met one of the owners for the first time...actually dig the place even more now!  I recommend the Southern Belle and the Ganache.  So get some milk get a good dental plan and go............"
They are closed. New restaurant is Terrace Cafe and it's amazing. Welcome to the hood.
"Awful customer service... AWFUL. Like I don't care about your safety awful.  DO NOT STAY HERE FIND ANOTHER PLACE IN DOWNTOWN VEGAS. \n\nI stayed here last year for Punk Rock Bowling we figured it might be a cheaper Golden Nugget since it still had a pool and the place was huge. Boy, was I in for a surprise. \n\nI reserved a smoking room, a friend of mine also had another smoking room. We both got there at the same time since we carpooled. We get non smoking rooms. We ask why their reply \""We already filled up the smoking rooms we only have non smoking\"". Ok then why have us reserve anything in the first place.... kinda annoying but whatever we can smoke in the casino I guess right?\n\nRooms are whatever, at least they look kinda cleanish but what does that matter when we're out partying all night and just using using the room to sleep and nurse our hangovers just do it all over again.\n\nSecond day I wake up to a banging and the sound of a door jiggling. I think maybe its my hotel roomie half awake/ still drunk trying to get in. When I get up I notice she's passed out in her bed too. The room next door is banging on the door that connects our room and TRYING TO OPEN IT. WHAT THE HELL!? \n\nCall management. They go in and talk to the other room which denies it. I ask to have my room changed. I tell them I don't feel safe. \""Sorry we can't do that\"". What about my belongings I ask.. \""there's a safe by the bathroom\"" Thanks... its about the size of an iPhone... The issues with the room next door continue. Its not funny anymore and I'm genuinely scared to be in my own hotel room. I ask a friend to stay with us and tell him what was going on. We call management again. We all talk about it AGAIN. I tell them how unhappy and unsafe I feel in this room. I get denied another room AGAIN.\n\nOur last day.\nIt happens again. This time our friend gets up and sternly tell them to stop. Goes outside and knocks on their door to try and see what is going on. Nothing happens but we can hear movement from next door. It doesn't happen anymore. \n\nI finally get home happy that I don't have to fear for my life anymore when I go to sleep and what do I see on my credit card bill.. an additional fee from Plaza Hotel. I call and ask what it was about. \"" Management saw you with an additional person in the room.\"" ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!? YES, BECAUSE YOU ASSHOLES DIDN'T DO SHIT ABOUT 2 GIRLS BEING HARASSED EVERY DAY IN YOUR HOTEL. After a couple of minutes going back and forth and speaking to one manager then another I've officially had it and Im tired of repeating the same story. They have no record of what happened with the room next door and the times that we spoke to management. But some how they know that our friend stayed with us because we felt scared to be alone. \n\nCharged me the extra money so that I could feel safe in your piece of shit hotel because YOU didn't do anything about it. Thanks Plaza. I hope you get shut down. You're a huge waste of space and judging by everyone else's reviews I'm not the only person that thinks you guys suck."
"As far as location, it doesn't get better than Paris, however that's about the only thing Paris has going for it.\nThe hotel is pretty from a far and seems fancy but it's nothing special when you actually spend time in the casino and restaurants.\nMy real reason for giving this hotel only 1 star is because of the staff. By far the worst, unhelpful, rude, miserable staff I've ever encountered (and I'm from NYC)...\nThe reception/front desk are not welcoming at all. They don't want to answer your questions and they just blow you off. The waiters and clerks all look like they're in pain working there and they never crack one smile.\nThe only good thing, like I stated is the location. But for the same view and location, I would recommend staying at Planet Hollywood."
"Always has been a favorite! The management and staff have always been great and do whatever to keep you happy! There is not one bad food item on the menu and everything tastes so good it makes it hard to decide. Their Buffalo Mac and cheese is great, also a fan of their pretzel too. Also all the beer options will keep anyone satisfied."
"My favorite local wine shop....great people, great staff and GREAT wine! I think everyone should check it out...worth the drive to lovely Cave Creek!"
"The orange blossom beer is great and the staff is friendly enough. However, waiting 2 hours for your food is unacceptable and I would only recommend this place to people who want to hang out for a while and drink beer."
I finally got a chance to try this spot not to long ago. It was really good! I had the Carlitos Shrimp Burrito and payed the extra $1 to make it wet with cheese on top. The price is very reasonable too. The staff behind the bar was friendly and it looks like they had some mixed drinks and beer available. The reason for the 4 and not 5 is the size of the place. It felt very very cramped. Also I plan on going back and and trying other items so if they are just as good ill raise it because then the size of the place won't matter.
"I am absolutely disgusted by the level of customer service at Sprint Store 6736 E Baseline Rd #104, Mesa, AZ. The staff there has the absolute worst bed side manner of any company I have dealt with. Every single rep there was completely indifferent to my situation, refused to help and failed to come up with reasonable solution. I then talked to corporate; they tried to help, but had me talk to the store manager. The manager didn't really listen to my complaint and refused to help or come up with a reasonable solution. Once again I called corporate for help, and was dumped back to the store. However, this time I spoke to the most appalling depiction of a customer service rep (Greg). After telling me what happened, arguing with me and refusing to even simply listen to my story, he caused me to escalate. This employee should never be allowed to answer any phone call; I am now considering the value of my Sprint service because of him. I would rather pay more money to another company, than know that a piece of my bill can support such a dreadful employee. In the end, a supervisor at corporate was able to come up with a simple solution to my problem. After spending 3-5 hours of my time to get this figured out when it could have resolved at the store in 30minutes.... I will not be recommending Sprints service to anyone, and I will be telling everyone I know about the outright terrible customer service that I received from Sprint Store 6736 E Baseline Rd #104, Mesa, AZ. Brittany, Jeff, Ryan and especially Greg... Thanks for ruining what I thought was a good service."
"Just say NO! The rooms were fine except for the construction 24 hours a day outside. The price was fine except the hidden #20 a day 'resort fee' magically tacked on at the end of our stay. The pool was fine, or at least it may have been had it been open, hell they told us on the phone it was! The wait in line to check in was fine except the for all the tourists. The $9 well drinks and $7 domestic beers were fine as long as you got them free at the tables and not the terrible bars. The showers were fine except the leaking fixtures and sandpaper towels. The whole experience was just fine, except that it wasn't and I would not recommend anyone ruining their Vegas trip with this crap hotel. Oh, and fuck your $20 bagel + $3 room service fee + $14 WIFI charge."
"My wife goes here ever chance she get, but I refuse to go with her. Coffee deserves 5 stars but the chick behind the counter is so rude. I refuse to spend money at a place that lets it indie hipster staff treat regular Joe's like my self rudely."
"I set up an appointment on WAHOO because my finger nail Got torn back and pulled out, after waiting and arriving they refused service. He said \"" I  dont remove nails, go to the hospital.\"" What's the point of an urgent care if they refuse Non emergency treatments. Since I had to choose a rating they get one star instead of 0"
Bad service- rude and unhelpful.  \ndirty - I saw a guy pick up the floor mats and clean them and never washed his hands. \n The food was horrible. Never again.
"Rosita's is better than Macayo's (that's not saying much), less commercial and more traditional AZ mex.. It is decent, but they over-cheese everything. Their food tends to be a bit greasy and overpriced, however the salsa is excellent. The menu is humongous and they cater which is nice when you forget it's mexican potluck day at work :) The service has always been fast, friendly and very attentive. \nI'm knocking it down to 2 stars because on last two visits the sewer smell (remember that smell from Long Wong's..) permeated the entire restaurant and I just about lost my appetite (which is not good when you are paying $8.95 for a freaking burrito)."
"I used to really enjoy this place and have had tons of fun here. Cheap drinks, enjoy some of the staff, good specials, trashy and divey. I enjoy all those things. After the last couple visits, but especially tonight, I'm sure I won't be back. \nMe and one of my girlfriends wanted to go get a beer and a bite to eat after work tonight. I suggested Dos Gringos. She got there first and said they didn't appear to be open. Hm, weird. So I said the Vine. We used to frequent this place often, but now its once in a blue moon. \nIt was pretty dead inside, which we were ok with. We sat at the bar. We ordered our beers and asked for menus. She ordered the special of chicken fingers and fries, I got a 1/2 order of nachos with chicken added. The food came out pretty fast, which was nice. We were hungry. My friend seemed to enjoy her food. Mine, oh man... These have got to be the worst nachos I've ever seen in my entire life. It was basically chips with big pieces of chewy, dry, bland chicken on top with salsa and sour cream on the side. Very  little chips and salsa on the side. To find a chip with cheese or refried beans on it was very rare. How can you fuck up nachos??? I'm not sure, but they did. Badly. \nSo yeah, food totally sucked. I ate it. What sucks worse then having terrible food when this hungry? Shit service. In a dead bar. Yes, that happened as well.  Absolutely awful service tonight. I didn't even want to tip the guy, but I did. Yes, I ate my food (or a quarter of it), but I did feel it necessary to mention how much I didn't enjoy it, he didn't give 2 shits. He said with a smartass voice that he was sorry with his back turned and walking away from me. Ugh. I'm so angry at The Vine for allowing such low standards when it used to be a great place to go.\n$13 with tip for 1 beer and the worst nachos I've ever put in my mouth is way too much money!!!! I've decided at the end, right now, me returning won't happen for sure. I don't deal well with bad service like that!"
"The store is small and uncomfortable, but the products are decent."
"I went on a girls trip for my friends 18th birthday and Palms Place was one of the only places we could stay at being so young. \n\nI was very happy with the hotel, the pool was great! We spent all of our days there hanging out at it, reading, and listening to the music they played.\n\nIf i were to go back to vegas I would definitely stay there again!"
"2 stars for decent service. \n\nThe sushi rice however, is always mushy and falling apart. \n\nI love kabuki in California and they never seem to have this problem. I've given this place multiple visits and chances to see if maybe it was just off days, but they just don't have their sushi together apparently. \n\nWork on that Alaskan roll sushi chefs! \nMaybe Los Angeles locations can help you have better quality sushi.\n\nThe table booths seem dirty. The walls are nasty looking. The little glass separators always have finger prints. The sunshade has sauces all over them. It's dusty in table lights. Not a very clean atmosphere. \n\nWhat is going on with this KABUKI in Las Vegas?!"
"I can't say I was thrilled with Billy Bob's Steakhouse, but its probably because i ordered the wrong dish: Coconut Chicken Tenders...definitely not a great combination. Service was great, our waiter Toni was a total sweetheart. Virgin strawberry margaritas are delish (a little on the tangy side, just the way I like it). I feel like the menu was a little lacking...perhaps I'm just not cut out to be a meat and potatoes girl."
"All I can say is, I really hope this place was having a bad day. I was really hoping this place would be good. I loved their sign out front and was hoping for a new place to go...but I guess not.\n\nWhen you first walk in, there is no real clear direction as to where you go to order. I walked up to where they were making sandwiches for another customer and stood there. There were two people behind the counter making sandwiches. One left to ring a customer up and came back. All along, for the 5 minutes I was standing there, nobody said \""we'll be right with you\"", \""Hello\"", nothing. I didn't even get eye contact, but I suppose that would have meant they would have had to say something.\n\nI finally got an \""Are you ready?\"", which as a side note I thought was somewhat rude. You can't even give me a \""Hello. How may I help you?\"" Just an \""Are you ready?\"" as if I had been making him wait a long time before making my decision. No... I was waiting on you. But I digress. I ordered and decided to get my sandwich to go because the environment wasn't much to look at and it felt claustrophobic.\n\nThe food meh and made with what seemed like bagged bread. You can look at my photos to see what I got. I think they speak for themselves."
"I recently had cox out to install internet and cable. \nWhen I received the bill, Cox had charged me to fish 3 lines into the walls and one from the front of my unit. So there are 4 seperate charges for puling lines into my unit.\nBesides having a coupon for free installation, my unit had just been renovated and the General Contractor had put all new lines in the wall and could be accessed right at the attic opening. I told COX that the GC could confirm that the lines were there. I explained to COX communications that there was a mistake and that I shouldn't be charged for the fished lines.  Cox said they were going to investigate this, but they never even called me back and the charges are still on my account. They have the worse customer service and I should have ordered Direct TV. \n-Mike in Phoenix"
"Wow.\n\nSo-so Chinese food for twice the price.\n\nNo wonder, it's a chain restaurant. Hey, they sell their food in the frozen food department at the grocery store, too. It might be the same quality. That may or may not be sad depending on the consumer. Is it that good from the freezer? Do they just microwave one of those bad boys in the restaurant?\n\nThe prices might be worth it for dinner but lunch? Ha. Ha. Ha.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
"Spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting. Weird, pasty sauce. Whole place seems kind of dirty. Booths need to be wiped down. Don't go here unless you're an undergraduate with low standards."
Awful does not begin to describe this clip joint.  Awful service and the food was about on par with a Dennys.  Somehow this place has managed to stay in business. I'll never be back again.  If you want good Italian in Vegas skip this place.
"Kinda of a rough and tumble crowd at times with the OTB booth in the back corner of the bar. Place is usually crowded after work with the blue collar drinking types and unless your a regular you will probably get ignored like I did on a previous visit. In this case, finally tried the food and it was surprisingly good. The waitress said that the buffalo wrap was good, so I went with grilled chicken tossed in mild wing sauce and that went into my wrap with the usual cheese, lettuce, some blue cheese and maybe a touch of bacon? THe wrap was huge and the chicken and blue cheese melded perfectly together. On the side dish selection wheel, I went with sweet potato fries - this was a decent version of that variety, but the raspberry sauce? served as a dipping option was a fail. Great service on a saturday afternoon and reasonable prices ($8.99) for a filling lunch."
Great place.  Great food...piping hot and delicious.  Excellent service.  House chianti was exceptional too.  I would just request to sit on the left side when you come in.  It looked to be quieter over there.  The right side is adjacent to the open kitchen.
"Another favorite in Vegas definitely the best Indian in town! I've been to the lunch buffet and the a la carte dinner. While the buffet is certainly worth the price I love coming for dinner so that I can order exactly what I want! \n\nThe garlic naan is a MUST. And I recommend it with some plain yogurt on the side! For main courses I really love the lamb (or vegetable) korma and the chicken tiki masala. I get both on medium (5) level and it still has a good amount of spice!! I'd say those two sauces are my favorites since I've tried others that are not as memorable to me. I don't love the chicken tikka but probably only because I'm a big sauce girl! I also really enjoy the okra vegetable dish! Full of flavor!\n\nThough the talk of slow service is true I'd say the food is too good to pass up and don't mind the service. I also like to finish my meal with a chai tea at the end. Overall great place eating so many delicious spices just makes me feel very warm and calm on the inside I would definitely consider this \""comfort food\"""
"I usually enjoy Starbucks if I want a sit-down breakfast alone away from home. The Starbucks at Von's Plaza is too tiny to expect to get seating, so I took my business to Einstein's next door.  Guess what? Same problem: tiny seating area. However, I think Einstein's gets slightly less traffic, so I was able to get a table.\n\nAlthough Einstein's definitely has many more food options and therefore a bigger breakfast selection, I think Starbucks wins the breakfast sandwich contest. Theirs is hotter and tastes better.  Einstein's turkey sausage sandwich was bland and the cheese wasn't even melted. Bleh."
"Have I mentioned that I love dive bars? This is a great dive bar. Small, but not overly sticky and dirty. Friendly bartenders and patrons. Standard beer selection. And there's pool and other things too. It's dark and just slightly sleazy. This definitely a good place to kill time, lose some money, and enjoy some cold beers."
"We ate here last night before the hockey game. It was very good as usual if you can stand the wait. I had the pepper crusted Gorgonzola burger, my hubby had the mac & cheese, which he said is the best in town!\n\nI keep track of everything I eat so I really splurged on this 1500 cal burger and also at $13 it is pretty expensive for a burger, but man is this thing good!\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because we had to wait for a table which is not unusual Westgate but also because we didn't see our server for the first 15 minutes that we sat down. Once we did get her attention she was very quick, got us to hockey game on time and did everything else very well. \n\nIf you're in Westgate, it's not too crowded and you have a few extra bucks, I recommend this Yardhouse."
"The service is not that amazing, it's almost as if they don't care to have a business. I've dealt with them for large orders and while meeting the deadlines they request, it's never enough. They usually don't have your requested kegs and will tell you to order earlier (which by experience still does not help). \n\nThe saving grace is likely for individual sales. From the times I've had go to the store to pick up our \""deliveries\"" (ie. nearly every time), it looked like they had a decent selection from the wall for cases...but who knows if they actually carry the selection."
"Since I was coming over to Glendale, AZ for Baseball Spring Training, I had to book a hotel for three days. I didn't really care where I was going to stay. So, I used Priceline's Bid System and with the low price I submitted, I was going to stay at the Crossland Economy Studios. \n\nI wasn't going to use the hotel that much since I was going to see the Los Angeles Dodgers at Camelback Ranch. So, this place was perfect to just sleep and go. Prices will vary when you stay here. I forgot to take a photo of this place, but its on McDowell and 51st Ave. It is a three floor hotel or an apartment. Why I said that?! Well, it seems like it was made as an apartment versus a hotel. The elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor. \n\nThe room is simple with a small electric stove, sink, and microwave. I didn't have tub, just a shower with a seat. For some reason, my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place. Not sure what that was about. Someone didn't clean the place thoroughly. Also, I noticed that every time I left the room and come back many hours later, I noticed the bathroom was a little wet, but major. So, there are some plumbing issues here. TV is very standard and room has an AC...COVERED WITH STRAWBERRY-COLOR'd type jelly. I swear it was all over the room.\n\nThere plenty of fast food places you can eat at that are just walking distance from the hotel: Sonics, McDonalds, and etc. If you are collecting trash, please note that housekeeping does charge. There are trash bins near the stairwells to dump the trash. \n\nOffice Hours are from 630am to 10pm. I had to leave a bit early, but there is a phone just outside the office to call the front desk. There isn't much to complain since I had already known that it was going to happen. If you don't plan to use your room often and save $$$$, then this is a place to stay. \n\nYelp is my Review, My Story, and My Life. It's time to share it."
"The name makes my mouth water.  Matts Big Breakfast.  \nQuality food, this location will make you proud of what downtown phoenix has to offer and what is to Come.  From the vegetables to the meat selection hand picked food creates quality dishes.  \n  This location serves a  big breakfast in a small place. I look forward to seeing this place grow, do i hear patio?"
"dissapoint on pricing, food didnt satisfy the spot,.2.star.for friendly staff"
"It's pretty harsh for me to give 2 stars, but read on.\n\nI'm an explorer.  I look for things to do with our young son when traveling. As a result, I have been to many children's museums.\n\nHalf of the freaking exhibits don't work, are broken, or just suck in general.   It's only two floors.  Vegas could support four floors easily. \n\nThe gift shop is great if you're 4.   \n\nThe fat trick at the front counter was on the phone arguing with her husband (?) as the other girl checked us in.  My son went to look around the corner and see inside the museum. She stopped arguing long enough to yell at him to STAY WITH YOUR MOM AND DAD AT ALL TIMES.  \n\nRight in front of her, I told him, \""IGNORE HER.  You are not mentally retarded nor handicapped. We haven't lost you yet and it's been almost 9 years.  Feel free to EXPLORE. \""   O_o\n\nShe just looked at me."
"I wouldn't give any stars for this dump of a place ... The floor was dirty , some of there machines were broken  &  filthy .. No manager or workers to be found & when they are around , they are rude  ..  I've been to this place twice and would never come back . I would rather pay more $ at a place that is clean and have friendly  helpful workers . I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy ......."
"Very glad we visited in our tour of Vegas pastry.\n\nThe almond croissant was delicious! It wasn't especially croissant-y, though, more scone-ish. Still, I loved every more-tender-than-flakey bite. The almond paste inside was so good, not too sweet.\n\nThe dining partner ordered a chocolate hazelnut cake. I scarfed what he could not finish. It was obviously made with good chocolate.\n\nNow, be warned: DO NOT ORDER A CREPE. They are not good here, and you will be missing what this shop does best.\n\nI am heartbroken to learn too late that the giant egg dispenses free chocolates. If only I had known..."
"The menu changes everyday, which makes it tough when you find something you like! We had a liver and heart pate (Tasty, it reminded me of Liverwurst) For dinner I had the 1/2 Chicken (Great), it came with a spaetzle and mushroom side (Great!)"
"Not bad food, combined with so so service. I tried the firebird chicken pasta and i have had better at chilies. I also don't drink soda so i ordered a lemonaid and since it was made at the bar  (non-alcoholic) they were 4 bucks each. it sounds like im cheap but 4 dollars for some sugar, water, and lemon? then 4 dollars for a second one? ok. the place was nice and huge on the inside, if i was taking a client out i would go there for the appearance but for my son, wife, and myself i think next time ill pass."
"The beginning of fall in Las Vegas really makes you want to eat outdoors.  Rachel's Kitchen in The District was a good pick for us while we were out and about.  We recently went vegan so choosing the right place to eat with a non-vegan in tow can be exhausting.  I asked one of the servers there on what options we can have and she showed me on the menu what we can have and what we can modify to suit our diet.  I ordered the Tomato & Basil Pasta, my partner had the Veggie Wrap, and mom had Pancakes with a side of bacon.  Can you tell who is the non-vegan here.  HAHA!  \n\nLet me tell you, the pasta essentially can be divided into 3 or even 4 servings.  It was so good that I had to pace myself and had enough leftovers for 2 servings for lunch for me and the hubby the next day!  The Veggie Wrap was good also.  Obviously I couldn't partake on the pancakes & bacon, but from moms' reaction, they were both good.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy and the bacon was crispy.  \n\nRachel's Kitchens' customer service is awesome.  Not only do their servers know what they are selling, the constant walk through by them outside kept us hydrated and our plates cleaned once we were done eating.  \n\nI highly recommend this place for good eats, good drinks, and if you love people watching, their patio is the best place for it!"
"We had the regional tasting that featured Tuscan cuisine along with the wine pairing ($75). The waiter Jered added much to the overall dining experience, as he elaborately described the history/culture surrounding each dish and described the wine notes and rationale for each pairing. The wines were excellently paired with each dish and portions were reasonable. Courses came at a very leisure pace, which we enjoyed - dinner lasted 2 hours. Price of dinner was just under $400 for the two of us (tip not included)...yes, pricey but quite honestly, the best fine dining experience we've ever had, and for that, the dinner was well worth it! I wouldn't recommend this for the casual diner or even those looking for only a romantic setting, but for true foodies that love wine pairings at its finest, I definitely recommend B&B Ristorante!"
You could not stop me from 1 staring this company. I have said before a bad company can't hide. Worst customer service ever (agreed). Chronic problems with web mail unresolved after years! If you don't like the cable service then get free cable with an antenna. They had a monopoly almost until Century Link came along but again you can get FREE HD cable (40+ channels) with an antenna. Vote with your feet (by walking away).
"I have had my fair share of buffets in Las Vegas, but the Wynn buffet was quite a disappointment. At $35 per person for brunch, the buffet lacked both variety and flavor. The Asian food station was bland, the sushi was too fishy and the seafood unappetizing. Italian food was decent though but the desserts were average. I was expecting more from this place but it let me down. Service was great though."
"Let me start by saying this place actually deserves 5 stars, but one major flaw made me knock it down one.\n\nThat flaw: There are 18 seats. Which translates to a minimum wait time of 1 hour... we waited 2 and a half.\n\nYES, 2 and a half hours standing in line in the middle of a casino to eat at this tiny little bar that serves amazing food. I rarely ever find myself in line for that long for any other reason. I wouldn't even wait that long to get a blowjob from Justin Bieber. That's just a ridiculously long time, and yet... I was still blown away.\n\nThe food is Cajun themed and serves a variety of Creole style food. I ordered the Jambalaya(+++), others in my party ordered the Seafood Bake(++), Gumbo, and Cioppino (fish stew+++). Aside from the Gumbo, which was a tad salty, the food was the best damn Creole food I've ever had.\n\nThe food is cooked in individual pans that are cooked right in front of you by a single chef. This dude runs around like a maniac, doing all the prepping, seasoning, oyster-shucking, clam-steaming, and rice-cooking. He is a machine and yet still so friendly. He kept working at a furious pace, but would still be able to converse with the seated individuals. He would be the an amazing bartender if he could mix drinks like the way he cooks.\n\nAll the ingredients are fresh, and the oysters are individually wrapped to ensure quality every time. After deciding upon a spiciness level (1-10) you get to watch the master work. Side note: I ordered a 4, and am a big fan of spicy food. I figured if it wasn't hot enough, I'll just add more hot-sauce. It was pretty darn perfect. A nice kick, but not too over-powering. My fellow diners ordered a 5 and 6, and the 6 was starting to get pretty intense.\n\nThe portions are huge, I finished only 2/3 of my Jambalaya and was shocked 'cause I have been left to starve and wince in hunger for 2 hours prior. The presentation is simple, but due to the quality and quantity of the food, it looked absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall, I would say this is definitely an AMAZING hidden secret in Vegas. But the Palace Station is off-strip and a little annoying to take a cab just for this meal. But if you ever find yourself in the area and are down for some GREAT seafood, this should definitely be an option... just be prepared to wait an ungodly amount of time."
I would never giver a star on this location. Very unprofessional people works at the printing. They should be fired in my vocabulary. I'm front the east coast and I mean business. I was there 11/24/14 at 9:45 am. Calling store manager....
"I'm not a whisky drinker and in fact, even the smell of it makes me feel sick. I worked for a catering company when I was at school and I remember having to walk around with trays of various different whiskies for people to take. Every single person asked me which was which and even though I should have arranged them in a manner that made it easy to remember - I didn't. So ended up just making whiskies up... I wasn't fooling anyone. After my whisky experience I still really am none the wiser about any of them but I've bought a few bottles in my time for retirement presents and such.\n\nThis store is jam packed and looks very traditional, with all kind of whiskies, they also have other spirits too including a good selection of gins (my favourite), I guess whisky is their speciality though and I'm sure whatever whisky you're looking for you'll find it in here. Great for a souvenir from Scotland, a gift for a whisky drinker or great if you just fancy treating yourself to  fancy new bottle of your favourite whisky."
"You just cant duplicate how friendly and knowledgeable the staff is here. First off, the stock of discs in this place is amazing. Any company, any model disc or accessories you need are here. They also run a few of our local leagues and do a tremendous job at that. \n\nI couldnt thank keith enough for finding me the best set of beginner discs 3 years ago and now i play roughly everyday and am a tournament player. If you dont disc golf yet or havent in years stop by say hello and get some knowledge about whats going on with disc golf nowadays. \n\nIf i could give 6 stars i would."
I don't even have the words!  Don't even have an app to order if you send an update that the food is out for delivery but I have to call every 20 min wondering where it is
We went to live to eat taco and I got the cashier service bues these ali does not want to take water from natural and has a bad attitude bad
"This place used to be good, and well worth the money and the time spent in the line. Not anymore.\n\nThe selection and quality of food was anything but good. It was edible, but tasteless. The meat selection and quality was rather bad, and so was the sushi.\n\nIt sure is not worth the $37 dinner or the 45 mins wait."
"I ordered the \""grilled\"" mahi-mahi plate and ended up receiving a mahi-mahi omelette. I politely went to the counter to clarify my order, but the employee, a young kid, claimed the mahi-mahi plate is cooked with egg. If that is the case, then the menu should clearly state that. Not grilled. I didn't want to argue simply because I was wary of having something done to my reorder, didn't want to waste food, and was already starving. On top of that, the mahi-mahi omelettes were extremely bland (along with the side of mac salad) that I needed to add a lot of Aloha soy sauce which was probably the only best thing about my meal."
"We are staying at the Mirage and happened to walk by this restaurant which looks amazing from the outside. My wife and I are avid sushi fans and thought this would be a fun place to try out. The waitress was very friendly and the Kirin Ichiban beer was great. The sushi, was not worth the high price tag. We ordered the calamari which is thick strips (it's good but also pricey). We ordered 3 sushi rolls and were very disappointed with the lack of creativity for such an expensive roll. We decided to close out our bill even though we were still hungry because we were not satisfied. \n\nThe regular sushi rolls are extremely tiny and are just the item around rice and seaweed.  If you are deciding on this restaurant for sushi alone, don't bother. If you like your sushi to have a variety of the sea's flavors, then don't go here. Maybe we are spoiled because we are from San Diego but I will not be coming to this restaurant again. We are used to much tastier, creative sushi for about half the price of Japonais."
"i think it was about 6 of us that decided we were hungry after the club/bars and stuff. so we decided to eat here at around 4 or 5 in the morning, which was convenient since we were staying at the venetian.\n i dont remember what anyone else ordered but i ordered the bacon cheeseburger, it was btwn that and fetticcini alfredo(for some reason i was craving that) but the waiter told me to get that burger. that was the best order at the table for sure!! thanks to that waiter i had a really good bacon cheeseburger.. but i was kind of drunk so i dont remember it as much as i would of sober. this place is a good place to go too though!! check it out if your in LV at the venetian, hungry and maybe even a lil buzzed"
"This store seems nice, but a manager or supervisor I spoke to about looking for an item I was looking for was beyond rude! I noticed he was spelling it wrong so I asked him to search again using the correct spelling. I was told \"" sir, your wrong. Do you even know how to spell what your looking for\""? Then he walked away without any resolution to my situation. I was clearly an inconvenience to his day and he made that clear. I would much rather go to best buy for my item and pay more."
"wolfgang puck is to food like jenny craig is to dieting. everyone knows him. this is the first time i've eaten at one of his restaurants and i was sadly disappointed. the presentation was nice and the service was friendly. (i couldn't tell if the waiter was flirting or just trying to give us helpful hints on the hot spots in vegas.) BUT the food was... fine. \n\nthe menu didn't have any stand-out dishes. it was all pretty standard fare, with very few bells and whistles. i ordered the chicken milanese which was pretty much fried chicken breast. eh. our app was steak skewers which were fine, but again... for a chef as well known as puck, i would've expected mouth-watering food.\n\ni would give this place a 3, but with the high expectations and the low delivery, it only receives a 2."
"4 of us girls cabbed it over to Hard Rock and came here for dinner on a Friday night without reservations.  Wait time was not bad at all- only 15 minutes in the lounge/bar area and we all ordered a cocktail to start.\n\nOur entire dinner was just AMAZING:\n\nFilet Mignon- so, so, so tender.  Just melted in your mouth!\n\nLobster Quesadilla- Ohhh so good with goat cheese and mango-jicama salsa.  And they had a real spicy kick to them, which I loved.\n\nCrab Cakes- 2 smallish cakes but VERY filling.  Crispy and golden on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside and the sweet sauce (papaya mustard) to go with was delicious.  \n\nCreamed Spinach- Most amazing I've ever had, seriously.  Creamy but not heavy, deliciously seasoned and it had chunks of thick applewood-smoked bacon in it.  I wanted to eat another plate full!!!\n\nSpicy Corn- came with roasted peppers, thai chilis, and cilantro.  Not the best corn ever but it was pretty damn tasty.\n\nBroccolini w/garlic and chilis-  I love broccoli but have never had broccolini before.  This plate was delicious and perfectly seasoned with a slight crunch. \n\nGreen & White asparagus- the only way to screw up asparagus is to over cook it so they're all limp and gross.  These most definitely were crunchy and hot.\n\nAs for cocktails, my girls enjoyed just vodka crans but I tried the Ultimat Dill which has ultimat vodka, agave-lime juice, fresh dill, and cucumber. Well made and very tasty!\n\nLast but not least...\n\nThe ambiance in here was really nice and the place is quite pretty.  Our waiter was so awesome and attentive (and good eye candy too, BONUS!)  I'd love to come back here and try more on the menu next time I'm in Vegas, and I'll be sure to get another coupon from restaurant.com!"
The food was good.\n\nFood delivery was extreamly slow.\n\nOur server was good.  But between our order and the delivery of our food we could have lost a grand inside the casino.\n\nThe food was good. But it is not worth the wait.\n\nPS: The restaurant was not busy at all.
Ok. The two stars are because the floors had many sticky diseases on it. WTF? Don't they clean the floors? But the bartenders did make me forget about the nastiness with the strong and cheap drinks. That was the only reason it didn't get one star. I'd go back if I'm in Champaign again.
Great club even if it has a small dance floor. Had a great dj didn't just stick to one type of sound switched it up from techno to hip hop. Bartender was really nice and fast to get our drinks. We went on a Wednesday didn't think it would be such a great club. We are definitely going back.
I don't understand when people tell me they love Ru Sans. The sushi is just ok... Nothing Special. 80% of the menu is deep fried. Ick.\n\nNot saying I would never go here again but there are SOOOOO many better places!
"With severe intestinal inflammation and after seeing another GI specialist who spent all of 5 minutes with me before trying to sell me on an (unnecessary) endoscopy i thankfully found Dr. Weisz.  He spent over a 1/2 hour doing a detailed examination and interview, determined that an endoscopy or even a CT scan was not necessary at this point, gave me a dietary regime to ease my symptoms and scheduled follow-up with me.  And, I saw those earlier comments about his staff - I found his staff both in person and over the phone to be excellent, courteous, and professional.  All around a great experience!"
"I live in such close proximity to Bellitalia that it's just silly last night was my first visit. However, it won't be my last because YUM!!!  It's a cute little hole in the wall with lots of character. Upon walking in, the aromas alone made me really glad to be there.  Our server was lovely and attentive and had great suggestions whenever we asked. The prices are reasonable and the portions are quite generous.\n\nI ordered the carbonara (it came with garlic bread) and my friend got a pizza. The carbonara was wonderful! Everything about it screamed homemade. And the bacon........the bacon was perfection and just the right amount too.  It wasn't at all a heavy dish like an Alfredo. I had some left over to take home, thank goodness (even thought I wanted to eat the entire bowl). The garlic bread was your basic garlic bread - nothing special, but it sufficed.\n\nMy only wish was that the pasta had been fresh, but honestly, the dish was super delicious regardless and it's something I would totally order again.  My friend really enjoyed her pizza as well. She loves their chocolate cake too, but they were all out, which in retrospect is probably a good sign with it being so popular.\nGive Bellitalia a try. We're really glad we did!"
"I absolutely loved this place! Easily my favorite restaurant in my trip so far.  And since is my last dinner in Canada, the best dinner of the \n\nUnfortunetaly we came too early for the live jazz (which starts at 7:30) but they were still playing recorded jazz over there speakers, and that definitely set a great mood. \n\nFirst the service.  I've noticed that in Quebec there is a certain snootiness.  Maybe they are trying too hard to imitate the French, even in their negative traits, but it definitely exists. But not here.  The waiter was super friendly, very fast and really helped the night flow smoothly. \n\nAs an appetizer we go the brie baked in something, then with some nuts, some sauce and some pears.  Ok, i'm not describing it well at all, but it was awesome!\n\nFor the main course I got the Greek-style lamb. It came with some vegetables, including this beat puree, and freshly made potato chips.  The lamb was absolutely delicious.  I tried a different lamb dish, that also was delicious.  If you come here, get the lamb.  \n\nFor dessert we tried the creme brulee.  I completely agree with Leighann F. This was not the best creme brulee I've had.  Not even in the top twenty.  The sugar was too thick and the creme was too clumpy.  I'm told that means they cooked it for too long.  The taste was fine, but the texture was just off. \n\nHowever, I also got the blueberry tea, which it turns out doesn't have any blueberries in it, but is made of Grand Marnier, Amaretto and hot Orange pekoe tea.  It gets its name because it smells and even tastes amazingly like blueberries.  Definitely something I'm going to ask for in the future! \n\nOverall, amazing experience.  Good for a date or a nice evening out."
"Let me start by saying, I didn't pay for my meal. I was my father-in-law's new wife's birthday so he paid.\n\nWe sat in the bar initially while waiting for more guests to show up. I figured with a name like \""The Keg\"" they brewed their own beer. Turns out they do not. They only have 4 taps and 2 of those are Bud. \n\nOnce all of the guests arrived we moved into the cramped dining room. I've noticed in other reviews no one has mentioned how incredibly dark it is in this place. It's DARK. My eyes readjusted several times while trying to read the menu. It was also very LOUD. They were playing DUBSTEP all night. That was weird. It's like a steak restaurant named for what should be a brewery with nightclub atmosphere.\n\nThere were 7 of us and they sat us a table fixed for 6 so it was cramped. We moved a few of the wine glasses that were reserved for water off the table just make a little room. Our waiter came back over and put the wine glasses back on our table stating that they have to be there with no further explanation.\n\nThe food was ok. I thought the salad was hoaky, but the blue cheese dressing was AMAZING. We got a little bit of horse radish with our steaks which was INTENSE. I'm a horse radish lover and even I thought it was a little extreme. It was good, but whoa my sinuses are still burning. I thought the steaks were good, but no better than what my dad or father-in-law usually make at home. The only other anomaly was an order of mashed potatoes my wife ordered. They brought out a platter about 16\"" wide with one scoop of potatoes on it. Made the already cramped table even smaller.\n \nIf you plan on having a party of 6 or more expect your bill to be in the realm of $500. No joke. The starting prices of steaks here are $25 just for the meat."
"My family and I were flying from Austin, TX to Phoenix (final destination was Anchorage, AK) on June 28th. We had our 12 year old daughter, who suffers from a brain malformation schizencephaly, with us. She requires a wheelchair to get around in and we gate checked it in Austin. There were two tags placed on the chair. One was for the gate check itself, the other was the full itinerary. When we arrived in Phoenix, my husband saw the ground crew take our daughters wheelchair and place it in a vehicle. Well, when you gate check something, you get it when you get to the next city. Not so much with US Air!! Now, they decided that the wheelchair was going to go directly to our next gate. We had a 4 hour layover in PHX. 4 hours of carrying my 12 year old, 66 pound daughter around. Yeah, I don't think so. So when I asked our flight attendant she quickly jumped at 'we can't speak with the ground crew\"" then proceeded to get herself ready to deplane. We took all of our stuff, including our other 2 daughters and my 12 year olds car seat, up to first class where we waited for the ground crew to bring my daughters wheelchair up. 10 minutes later, we were asked to deplane so they could get the plane ready for the next batch of passengers. We waited for about another 10-15 minutes in the terminal waiting for them to bring me her chair. When we finally got the chair, the lady was very rude saying \""Here's your chair\"" then walking off. I will never fly US Air with my daughter again. This was completely unprofessional and unbelievably rude."
"Epic adventures typically start with a seemingly insignificant event. My review of the HGI South Strip begins about a year ago. My job required me to be in Las Vegas more frequently, and this location was both convenient and preferred for corporate stays. Since that time I have logged over 60 days this year alone, sometimes staying just for the night, other times staying for two weeks at a time. I've even stayed here recreationally while on vacation.\n\nThe Good: Efficient for the business traveler, the hotel features clean fresh rooms. Refrigerators, coffee makers, irons and hot water in the mornings. Far enough from the party to allow a good night sleep before that client meeting, HGI is consistant no matter the city, this one is no different. You also have a well appointed exercise room, a small pool, and a small friendly lobby bar.\n\nThe Bad: lacking in some of the basics that make modern travel tollerable. The internet connection is a string with two cans operated by a drunk dislexic old man. Slow, confusing, and frequently falling off without notice. For breakfast, you have a choice between quick, greasy self served caffeteria food, or slow mediocre table service. Neither is free, tasty or convenient.\n\nThe Ugly: Just like in real estate, sometimes it's simply about location, location, location. This is about as far from...um, anything? If you don't rent a car, you can walk to the Burger King, the old Bootlegger Bistro, or the failing factory outlet mall, featuring an empty carousel in the abandoned food court.\n\nIt may sound like I don't like the HGI, but it has become my home away from home. And just like home, once you grow up, its just not enough."
"There are so many things wrong with this place. Should I start with the service? I'll start with the service. The staff is usually preoccupied with chatting or card games when you walk in, so being seated, getting menus and ordering water takes 15 minutes. \n\nThe food is mediocre at its best, cold and bland at its worst. We  ordered pad thai, spicy fried rice, chicken satay, tom yum gai (arrived cold), red curry and beef larb. Most of it tasted like nothing, the rest tasted like watered down garlic juice. \n\nThe prices are high, especially with the long wait between dishes and the staff walking away before we were finished ordering. Please go to Archi's Kitchen or Lotus of Siam."
"I hardly ever go to this location and today I went there with friends. It was empty, overpriced and the beef on the rice was cold. Very disappointing. The one on Decatur is on their game though! :)"
"Even though XS totally stole Tryst's thunder, I still love this place. I always have fun here. I like how the dance floor spills outside near the waterfall/pond so that there's readily accessible fresh air. Also, the layout is more interesting than the boring boxy clubs and the people who work here are a gazillion times better than TAO. It's never a problem getting in, and it's not uncomfortably crowded. Also, getting a drink doesn't usually take too long. And the bathrooms are really cute!"
People are very rude! I was told for an extra $100 when can buff out all the scratches and it would look like a new paint job...no wonder this place has a bad rep!!! I had to give it a rating
I think I've officially had my first taste of real southern BBQ.  This stuff was slow cooked and flavored just right.  I really liked how the brisket was nice and tender.  And the sauce a very nice addition to the flavors of the meat.  The people were fast and friendly and it was a really fun time.
Very fresh delicious chicken strips. . The texas toast is soft and delicious with just a slight toasted top .....very well worth the stop in VEGAS before heading home to los Angeles
"Good food,  extremely good value,  a little more spice than I can handle in dishes I wouldn't expect it from.\n\nSlightly disappointed as we had come up to try the naan and it's no longer on the menu. \n\nI'd have given five stars,  but we ordered rice and it never came."
"I don't think everyone knows this place is open yet, not even the hotel employees- but it is, and its a CUT above the rest! My BF and I had the pleasure of dining at Wolfgang Puck's newbie this last weekend.  It is a spin off of the Beverly Hills location, but a lot easier - at this point- to get a reservation. \n\nThe decor is very modern and sexy, lots of deep purples, black, silver and mirrors- with kind of a rock vibe as they played classic rock all night long. There was a lounge/bar in the opening room of the restaurant, followed by a large open dining room and a smaller space behind a half wall.  The service was superb, there were at least 7 people involved in taking care of our table- server, sommelier, GM, host... the list goes on. Everyone was extremely helpful and you could feel their excitement and anticipation of being apart of a new restaurant. \n\nWithin the first few minutes of sitting down we were brought a selection of breads, homemade and purchased from La Brea bakery- my favorite was the pretzel!  We ordered a bottle of Spanish red Artuzu, which I had never had before, but was surprisingly tasty and affordable. Their wine list was many pages long, for those of you lucky folks who have hit it big and can spend your dough. Soon after, the cuts of meat that were featured for the day were brought to our table for viewing; I never thought big hunks of blood could look so beautiful, but they did.  The menu highlights particular selections from 4 sources, so that one can choose based on palette preference and budget.  The USDA Prime was the least expensive, followed by USDA Prime aged 35 days, American Kobe and 100% Japanese Wagu.  We chose the USDA Prime 34 oz. porterhouse for 2 and were not disappointed. Although my curiosity is killing me about the $80 6 oz. filet : )\n\nAs we waited for our steak and potatoes....we wined, sampled the pork belly appetizer and were given a hot gruyere roll- yumm!  When the entree arrived the steak was cut table side for us. It smelled amazing and was top with fresh thyme for an added effect.  The portion was larger than we expected and divinely cooked- a little pink with no char outside as I had requested. We ate it all!! Unfortunately, that left no room for dessert, so I cannot comment on that. But I was so satisfied it didn't matter.  \n\nThings are great now, and I would go back to CUT, but can only imagine that things will get better as the staff, kitchen and hotel gets more practice."
Do not purchase video games here! Used games are ridiculously overpriced selling for more than double the price of new.
"I wouldn't recommend this place to any one I like. What kind of restaurant serves salads and charges you for the dressing? I ordered the Symphany Sandwich and was charged an extra .75 for the lettuce, which I can kind of understand but even still, aren't they saving money since I'm not using their bread? Any ways, I let that slide. Then I pick up my food go outside to eat on their patio and I have no dressing...so thinking they made a mistake I go back in there and asked if dressing came with their salads and the girl was like, \""Did you ask for dressing?\"" - Am I supposed to ask when I'm ordering a salad!? - so I said, \""No, but I ordered a salad...it doesn't come with it?\"" \""No that's extra, did you want to get some?\"" Yeah, I was done with this place from that moment on. For the amount of food I got coupled with the price and service...I would only send people I hated to this joint. \n\nTotally sucks."
"Terrible customer service. I called Walgreen's customer service 4 times, and never received a call from management as promised. Here is the email I sent them, which I have not received a reply to either!\n\nThis is the Walgreen's located at 2000 S Mill Ave  Tempe, AZ\n\n\""I have called, and spoke with your customer service several times, but have never received a call back as I was promised. The phone number associated with these calls is 480.967.XXXX. The exact date and time should be in the notes from those calls. I am xxxx xxxx, a 59 year old Walgreen's customer of 30 years. I ride a small two wheel electric scooter. It is smaller than a shopping cart. It is not practical to lock this scooter, and the expensive batteries cannot be secured. This scooter is like a two wheeled skateboard with handle bars. I have ridden it to Walgreen's, and brought it in the store with me to pick up prescriptions on many occasions. The last time I picked up a prescription I was told by a man, I assume is a manager, that I can't bring my scooter in the store anymore. This is ridiculous as it is small, makes no noise, makes no mess, takes up very little room, and is my only means of transportation right now. No one has ever complained about it, and when I mentioned not being allowed to bring it in to the pharmacist, he could not understand why, and commented that people bring bikes in the store. I bring this scooter into the grocery, hardware store, fast food stores, and everywhere I go with no problems. I explained this on the phone to your representative, and was told I would be contacted. I was never contacted even after calling back several times, and was told the complaint was being escalated. . This is terrible customer service! I regret that I am contacting my Dr., and having my prescriptions transferred to CVS. CVS has no problem with me bringing my scooter in the store, and  also allow my dog in the store, if I walk there with my dog. I am very disappointed with Walgreen's apparent lack of concern. I will also leave reviews on line wherever possible to let other people know of this incident. \"""
"Deliciously flavorful juicy burgers and fries!  My boyfriend says its one of the BEST Italian beefs he has ever had.  I would like to see more on the menu, but it is a good thing that they stick to what they do best BEEF!"
"Mmmm so much choice and it's all completely awesome: thin crust pizzas, pastas, gnocci. Everything is done to perfection and the service is top notch. You may end up sharing a table with complete strangers, but who cares, that's totally fun! There is truly something for everyone on this menu and you cannot go wrong no matter what you pick.\n\nI had the Chef pizza: mozzarella, black olives and tomatoes; it was deeelish.\n\nBest part about Napoletana is that it's BYOW, yesssss! (There's an SAQ a 3 minute walk away, so there is no need to settle for a bottle of Chateau D\u00e9panneur.)\n\nOh yeah, and it's cash only!"
Message test dinner at MNs suggestion. Cool urban setting.  Forgot I was in Phoenix.  Felt more like Denver or San Diego.  Pizzas and salad were stand outs.
"Disappointing. The Avondale location must have different cooks/recipes because I've eaten there multiple times and always been pleased. The Scottsdale location on the other hand was terrible. The location is good, but the restaurant still screams Bennigans or Luby's or whatever it should be but isn't \""Mexican.\"" The salsas were blah. Again, Avondale is doing something different. The queso was nearly inedible with a very coarse, gritty texture. The plates came out and although my food was hot, my son's plate was cold. The cheese enchilada was boring. The beef \""burro\"" was.....was....I don't know how to describe it. If the beef was on a hoagie it would have been a bad Philly cheese steak too. But, it was more suited to that than a Mexican burrito. \n\nOverall, I apologized to my family that I forced them to go there for dinner. Considering within 2 minutes of driving, there was Maggianos, Gordon Biersch, and a plethora of great restaurants, I was sorry I made them go. As we were leaving, I commented that the best thing I had was the water and my usually easy going daughter agreed. If you find yourself at that corner, pick another place."
"let me detail my last experience:\n\nI called network automotive on Main St. in mesa for a quote for replacing a part on my vehicle.  I had done my own diagnosis and was confident that the problem would be remedied with this procedure.  On this call they took down the information and said they would call me back with a quote.  They did return my call later that day and left a message saying to give them a call back.\n\nI called them back the next day and received a quote that seemed reasonable given the labor rate, and the price that I could find the part for.  I made an appointment for the next day at 8:00 am.  I was under them impression that the part was already ordered considering I was a return customer, and I had an appointment set. \n\nI arrived right at 8am to have the procedure done.  I handed my keys to the person at the desk and proceeded to wait.  What I saw happen next was that my truck was pulled into the back corner angled away from me, the hood put up, and not one person went near my vehicle for an hour and a half.  At around 9:30 I asked them if I should bring it back at a more convenient time.  They said they receieved the wrong part from the parts supplier.  I just looked at the person expecting him to tell me the correct part was on the way and he didn't; rather, he asked, and I quote, \""why do you want to replace that part?  I've never had to replace that part before.\""  I must remind you that on the first phone call I explained to them exactly what I wanted to have replaced and why.  At this time I explained to him exactly what I had already explained twice already, on the phone.  After I finish he tells me that he can only find the part I need for over 3.5 times the price that I could find it for from Autozone.  As this is all happening the tech has finally decided to pull out the old part, and he comes walking in to the desk area with it, and he says, \""yeah, it's bad.\""  This made me think that it took about 2 minutes to get the part out.\n\nAll in all, I ended up paying 90% MORE than what they originally quoted me, I paid 125% extra for the part, and paid for 1.5 hours of labor, for a 15 minute job.  I was there right at 8, and was able to roll out at 10:50.\n\nIn conclusion I will never take my vehicle back there.  My vehicle is over 10 years old and I maintain it very well, as it is an essential part of my livelyhood.  It's unfortunate that we cannot count on a local business such as this one to take care of the people from the town where they do business.\n\nI see a lot of people that give rave reviews over their alignments, and I'm sure they probably do a good job, but if you need parts, prepare to get GOUGED."
"The mansion fantastic. The grand entrance and picked up via the gold mgm limo. truly in awe the whole time.  the food the food the food.  foie soup, goldflaked curdled egg appetizer, dover sole, the maine lobster, bison, lamb, and the cheese and bread cart stood out. the degustation menu, fantastic. the meal fantastic. i can die now and be happy. Imma match the 16 degustation entree's with 16/16 judochops..well done 3 star michelin.  Dinner for two plus wine pair and bubbly and tip = under 1k. Next stop Jiro in japan. hiyaaa!"
"Do I even have to give a star? In Australia we call this style of dining yum cha.  \n\nFirstly, They say the kitchen closes at 3pm, and we arrived at 2pm. The dim sum cart came around once, then we were told to order from the menu if we wanted more food. The service was SHOCKINGLY BAD, they would ask you a question, and then ignore the answer, only to ask the question again, only to get caught up in a conversation with another server, only to ask the question again.\n\nI can't even be bothered telling you all the other issues here, because I want to clear my head space from people/businesses like this.\n\nNEXT!"
"Another truly amazing Cirque show that needs to be seen.  The acts in this show, I believe, are the most dangerous acts I've seen in all the Cirque shows in Vegas.  The mastery of skills that were on display during the show is just incredible to watch.  The athleticism required to perform the stunts leaves me speechless."
"My bestie and I stayed here 2 years ago. It was a complete nightmare! We weren't able to check in until after 6pm, when we were told an 11am check in would be fine. Our room was dirty and dingy, I wouldnt walk around barefoot; might even want to wear rain boots! Shower didn't work (um I would like to have washed all the desert heat and grimmy room feel off of me) \n\nWe went out and enjoyed Fremont st. Came back to sleep at this crackden of a hotel. In the morning, we could visibly see all the stains, which looked like past guests included Freddy Kruger (blood) and Ron jermey (yes, semen). Nice veiw of the parking lot, with broken glass and car alarms going off every hour. \nTried to talk to management, got nowhere \n\nUnless you want that horror movie, run down motel feeling, DON'T stay here. Disgusting"
"Before the Novocain had worn off today, I received an email from my dental hygienist with the following message:\n\nShauna,\n\nIt was nice to meet you today. I hope you recover well from the cleaning and treatment. Have a good day! \n\nNatalie\n\nAfter two years without dental insurance, and no means to visit their office, they remembered me and treated me just as courteously as if no time had passed. They explained that since I had come in on a Tuesday, I would be getting a different hygienist. Honestly, I don't remember my last hygienist but the gesture was meaningful nonetheless. As I bemoaned the gap in my teeth (hate it) Dr. Tim said, \""You have a great smile,\"" and he meant it. \n\nToday, I had three shots of Novocain and two hours of \""open wider\"" but I never felt rushed or pressured to get on to the next patient. We talked at length about my flossing habits and I was given an explanation of which floss is best for my particular bite. Dr. Tim is out of network on my insurance and I could not care less.\n\nYes, my tooth hurts and chewing is a bear but I sincerely believe Dr. Tim and his team care more about my teeth than I do. And I carry floss in my purse... \n\nIf you're looking for a new dentist, please check out Healthy Smiles. Even if he is not in your neighborhood, it is worth the drive.\n\n(PS: I'm generous on reviews but I feel strongly enough about this 5-star review to rethink previous generosities.)"
Italian hero was decent but probably wouldn't come back for it.  The pasta salad was old and some of the pasta was starting to get hard.  No bueno.  Overall I'd say they are coming up short in too many levels. If you want a real Italian deli go to Niccolis not too far from here.  They have one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!
"I have fond memories of the 'wichcraft in Bryant Park from a few years ago.  Maybe it was the sitting-outside-and-actually-being-outside that made the experience so enjoyable... but no, I really think it was the fresh, hot sandwiches that made it such a memorable lunch spot.  It's too bad Vegas has Vegas-ized it into mediocrity.\n\nThe line was to the door at 4pm on a Saturday.  I was surprised, but I guess I shouldn't be - I forgot how time means nothing when you're in a casino.  Considering the sandwiches were pre-made and just needed to be plopped onto the panini-griller, it seemed to take a while - but I wasn't in a hurry, so I can deal.  \n\nI ordered the ham/cheddar/apple on pumpernickel and got it to go.  I was so excited to savor the awesomeness remembered from Bryant Park that I ripped it open in the car to take a few bites.  \n\nOooh, messy!  I don't know what happened - maybe the water content of the apples was too much? - but half of the sandwich was so soggy, it was like it had just been bathed.  The other half was just fine - so strange.  I think cheddar was the wrong cheese choice on their part - it made the whole thing so bland, like it zapped out any flavor the apples and ham had brought to the table.  I hate to say it, but I've had a Subway sandwich or two more exciting than this.  Maybe their other creations are better?"
"I have been going to Happy Cleaners for quite a long time now and felt compelled to give them a review.  I can honestly say that we have NEVER been disappointed with the quality of the work.  Our dry cleaning is well priced and ALWAYS perfect!  We have had several other services including tailoring and alterations and we are surprised by the low price and quality of work.\n\nWhile you may find similar pricing and quality, what I challenge you to find is friendlier service.  It seems like service has become something of a lost art, but not at Happy Cleaners!  How rare is it to go into a business where they actually great you with a smile and call you by name every time you come in.  They are simply over the top and they will have me as a customer as long as they are in business.  \n\nHappy Cleaners is a perfect example of how a small business should be run!  I would highly recommend that you try them out!"
"Terrible service experience! I went in to buy some tires, so I was waiting at the tire service counter with one person in front of me and another behind me. The advisor who was helping the person in front of me said to me I'll be with you in just a moment sir, at which I nodded and said that's fine. Well after about 10 mins I am still waiting... now the person in front of me is outside the store with the advisor, I am at the counter waiting for help, one person behind me. While I am at tbe counter, another advisor walks up to the person behind me and says how can I help you, and took them to another service counter. The person behind me was foreign, and obviously didn't get that what she was doing was rude behavior, however the Service Advisor should have! I waited 5 more minutes to no avail, I left the store, they lost a sale. Very unprofessional, I will not go here again."
"$40 dollars for Sauce, Dough, Cheese, and Sausage?  Give me a break.  My wife and I go out often.  This was the worst service I have received in years.  Over priced hole in the wall pizza joint.  We heard good things, we were not sure what people see in this place.  Not for us."
"Harlow's, you are overrated.  Your potatoes are greasy and seem like the cook couldn't decide what they were, just make real hashbrowns.  Your eggs are too expensive and are not worth 2.50 a piece, ridiculous. The toast was coated is unmelted butter and the coffee was cheap.\n\nI do not understand how you get] so many customers or why you are such a Tempe tradition, go to Chompies or Essence."
"My husband and I enjoy eating at Noodle Asia.  \n\nOne of our favorites we like to order is their pan friend dumplings.  They are huge!  They are filled with pork and vegies.\n\nTheir noodle soup, the duck and bbq pork is delicious as well.  I've tried Mama Woo's Spicy noodles soup too and it was great!"
"We had a really nice time here. The place is small. I was immediately impressed when I saw the wood-fired pizza oven. The owner served us personally and couldn't have been nicer. We had a pizza with mozzarella, meatballs, and sausage. The pizza had really excellent flavor, and I was very impressed with the quality of the meatballs. The little char on the crust from the wood oven was magical. \n\nMy only complaint is that we didn't leave totally stuffed. We got the 2nd largest pizza, but the pizza is so flat that it isn't too filling. The other dishes and appetizers were really expensive, so we didn't get anything else. We aren't competitive eaters or anything, we just like to be full and have some leftovers. Am I greedy? Maybe. \n\nIt was delicious, so we would definitely go back. Next time, we'll get two, smaller pizzas. That would be good."
"I went to Flat Top Grill last night on a date, and I really enjoyed it! \n\nThis was only the second time I've ever really been to a stir fry place like this, but I thought their selection of veggies and such was pretty good. Everything I chose to put in my bowl tasted pretty fresh. I was kinda confused about which sauces to use, so I chose from their suggestions. I had the sweet and spicy sauce, and I really liked it.\n\nThey don't really have a wide array of appetizers to choose from, but I don't think that's supposed to be their specialty. I'm generally an appetizer person though, so I had the shrimp summer roll, it was light and tasty. A good opener for the meal.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, I found that great too. It was pretty crowded while I was there, but the tables are far enough away from each other that you don't feel like you can hear everyone else's conversations, i really like that.\n\n\nAlso, a student discount is always a plus.\n\nI would definitely go back again!"
"This is a great pub in the Newington area. There's an excellent selection of beer, a cool horseshoe bar, friendly staff and comfy seats to enjoy your tipple with. \n\nBest part? There is no music. You can actually come here, relax and have a conversation with your friends or colleagues. \n\nThe pub has a good atmosphere and despite its old man appearance there is a wide range of people that come to drink here. Cost wise, you're paying about average for a pint these days. Maybe \u00a33 odds for something like Tennants. A draft like Staropramen will probably set you back a bit more. \n\nOn another positive note, the ladies' loos are very nice. Always a bonus! I've been exploring the pubs in this area with my work nearby - this is one of the best so far."
"The spa lobby was quite stunning. We were blown away when we walked in. It was like a palace!\n\nWe first used their facilities, which was quite impressive. There were different lounges of locker rooms, private changing rooms, waterfall showers, heated patio stone chairs. \n\nWe booked the massage last minute, they were able to accommodate us, which was nice. We had a couple massage there. The massage was good. I almost felt asleep during the treatment. \n\nI have to take off one star because it was pretty expensive---$180 for 50 minutes for each person."
"Not to jump to any conclusions, but this is our second time here and the service is still the worse unless you are of a certain skin tone. There were two other tables around us and they were being waited on very attentively while we had to ask for a menu and get ignored while we just sat there.  The table that arrived after us got plate settings, menus, and drinks even though we were there at least 15 minutes before. We paid for our drinks (I had to walk up to the bar to order and pay, while the other tables got served) and went to a real local place that knows service. We gave Three Angry Wives a second chance but unfortunately they failed again."
"You have got to be kidding me?! Old stylists, even older clients nothing new or innovative. I guess this is where old stylists go to die!"
"I so wanted to like this place, but I was not a FAN! I got the combo with BBQ pork and teriyaki chicken and chicken fried rice.  The BBQ pork was not GOOD at all, chewy and tough to eat.  The teryiyaki chicken was even worse, the sauce was a clump of jello like substance.  GROSS!  The fried rice was so soggy and the beans did not go with the rest of the food.  =(\n\nThey have a friendly staff and hurdle customers in like cattle."
"I had only been to two other Churrascarias in my life and this one totally blows the other two out of the water.  I think the best meats were the shark, salmon,  bacon-wrapped sirloin, the tri tip, and the ham.  They also did a grilled pineapple off the skewer and it was pretty awesome. As for the available sides....the mushroom risotto was very very tasty.  I liked the cheese bread as well.  There was a whole bunch of salad options, but hey, I'm at a churrascaria... I was in \""meat\"" mode.  I bypassed the greenery that day.  I know, shame on me.  I did get a sampling of their asian noodle salad, which I liked.  It was about $50 for all you can eat meat/seafood.  Soooo worth it.  I will definitely be back whenever Im in the area."
"The first 3 times we boarded our dogs here we were pleased with the care they received. My only complaint those times was that the boarding area smelled horrendous, like a dog pound or something. A dog smell is understandable but the smell it had seemed like it wasn't cleaned very often. We used them anyway because money was tight & they were affordable. Each of those visits, we were encouraged beforehand to bring whatever items would make our dogs feel at home & when we arrived, they let us go back & unpack their things & put them in the kennel ourselves. \n\nThey keep each dog's belongings & food in their own large container with a lid, & I appreciated this organization. However, the last time we boarded them, we packed them each a bag with a blanket, a couple of their toys that they could keep in their kennel, & their food. On our last visit, I waited for the invitation to go back & unpack the dogs & she told me they were too busy for that but she would make sure they got all of their stuff.\n\nWhen we went to pick them up, 4 days later, the girl opened the container to give me their belongings & she handed me both of their bags...still neatly packed away like I had given them the day they arrived. When I asked why they hadn't at least given them their blankets her response was to chuckle & say, \""Sorry, we forgot.\"" So, for 4 days & 8 meals, they moved each dog's packed bag to get to their food & it never dawned on anyone to actually GIVE my dogs their stuff. The thought of them alone in the kennel for 4 days without so much as a blanket made me livid. This was definitely the breaking point for me & we will never use their service again. \n\nI also had a problem on every visit with them trying to charge me about $100 more than the rate I was quoted in an email & each time I had to show them the email & wait about a 1/2 hour for them to go into the house & discuss it with the owner (who I was never allowed to meet). They did give me the overcharge back but they were very rude about it. This routine happened on every single visit. \n\nI'm not saying this is a bad place or that I wouldn't put my dogs here if it were the only place available but since there are so many more reputable choices in town, I'd recommend going somewhere more professional. Yes, it's a \""cute\"" place but I feel like the veneer is just a bandaid to some obvious underlying problems because they always seem short staffed."
"Picked up a car was fine but I reserved a car to return at different station. All information I received was wrong, I called call center and they gave me wrong info. The number they gave me was useless because takes forever to get LIVE person."
"This place is the perfect example of a tourist trap.  Nice location not far of the main drag of Old Scottsdale, beautiful building and layout.  The margaritas are good, but probably $2-$3 more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles.  I thought paying $5 for chips and salsa was a rip-off, but then when the chips tasted stale, I was even less happy.  C'mon, if you have tortilla and factory in your name, you ought to have fresh chips.  I thought the tortillas themselves were okay, not great, but okay.  The carne fuego, or whatever I had the waitress recommended, was not good.  Small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweet/hot sauce. The veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potato-stuffed chile was weird.  It could've been great, but it was nowhere near good.  Unless your Aunt Hattie who has never had Mexican food is in town from Ohio, i'd skip this place altogether."
"This the 2nd time I have seen the show and I swear it just gets better. I literally could not laugh anymore! If you truly want to laugh your ass off then you need to go see Carrot Top... You will not regret it!!!! \nI have sent everyone who comes to town for a visit to the show and they all agree \""it's hilarious\"""
"Cheese Curds- 2 out of 5 curds\nTiny, bite-size cheese curds, pretty adorable in size. Nothing too special in terms of fried cheese curds, just average. Pile of good poppin fun to eat. \n\nSweet Potato Fries- 4 out of 5 curds\nDelicious! Not sure if it's because they are made from sweet potatoes or what, but these tasted far less greasy and guilty to eat than regular fries. Very skinny shoestring fries that don't make you feel fat eating them. \n\nMac 'n Cheese Wedges- 5 out of 5 curds\nMmmmmm. This was the first place I had ever encountered this native Sconnie delicacy. I wasn't really sure what to expect when I bit into the light-colored wedge, but an explosion of warm, cheesy Mac n cheese filled my orifice. Would definitely do this again. \n\nSouthwest burger (w/ bleu cheese & tomato) - 2 out of 5 curds\nFor claiming to be the best burgers in town I'd have to disagree. The Southwest burger is a medium rare beef patty topped with cheddar cheese, bacon, and a special BBQ sauce. I substituted for the pungent yet addictive bleu cheese. And added tomato. The burger presentation was poor, a bit sloppy and disappointing to the eyes. The buns look and taste pretty cheap and low quality. The burger was built in such a sloppy manner any chance at a civilized biting approach was shot. Bacon was good. Cheese was good. The tomato slice provided a nice fresh contrast. So we're the pickle slices that almost fooled our table into being cucumbers just by there appearance. Regardless of the presentation I inhaled the burger after the hour long wait to sit and another hour wait for food. \n\nSince the star of this review should have been the burger since Dotty's claims to have the best in town I was pretty disappointed. Would not return for a burger, but might for the Mac n cheese wedges if I can't find them somewhere else around town. \n\nGiant pickle is cool."
"Excellent service. No problems. Free upgrade and one of the sales associates took me home when she got off work.  If I need to rent another car, I will definitely come here again."
"I will keep this short and simple. \nService - awesome. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is so nice and attentive! \nDining area- we requested to be seated in the wooden weavy basket area. Love the layout. This is a nice place if you wanted to do a business dinner! (We were just a party of two though)\nAppetizer- Dungeness crab cocktail. Okay. I am spoiled by Seattle's seafood so I have high expectations. Yes. The crab is good. Cold and refreshing. However for $25 dollars I rather have tried something else as I can get much more up north. However it was good. \nSteak- bone in filet was their signature so that's the one we chose. I think they cooked it exactly the way we wanted. Medium rare. It was tender and it was good, but not melt in your mouth fantastic. It was overshadowed by (dun dun dun) the fish!!! \nSeafood- Chilean sea bass. I got it the \""arreganato\"" way. I probably butchered the word too. Holy crap this was amazing. It melted in your mouth and left you wondering where the heck it went so you just kept going back for more. \nSides: thanks to the yelper who gave the advice to get half the amt of gnocchi. Omg this is soooo good. The truffle oil just perfected it. Best gnocchi ever!!\nLobster mashed potatoes was a huge portion (had to take it to go!) I am not really a mashed potato or lobster fan but my bf is and he really liked it so definitely try one of these sides. \nDidnt have room for dessert but we really wanted to try the butter cake. Lame. Next time! \nOverall a good experience but expect to cough up some serious $$$. Try the fish!!!"
"I've stayed here twice.\n\nThe FIRST time I came here, I stayed at the Masquerade tower. The AC in the room was the weirdest thing ever. You were either freezing your dick off, or sweating balls. The TV was old and blasted radiation in my eyes. The view was crap. I lost a shit ton of money playing games of the adult variety. \n\nI said to myself, \""Never again!\""\n\nMy buddy Alex drags me by the collar and forces me at gunpoint to accompany him to Vegas and stay at the Rio. I said \""Please sir! I'd rather eat a cowchip before I enter that rathole again!\""\n\nAfter consuming said cowchip (maybe I should've told him I just didn't want to go..), we stayed at the Rio for two of the most unpleasant nights I've ever had since turning 21. \n\nOn the plus side: 600$ from a slot machine!\nOn the downside: 3 rowdy children screaming at the top of their lungs next door from the hours of 8am-11am. Seriously?? Don't you know that these are the REAL quiet hours in Vegas??"
"We had an enjoyable visit here and our experience with customer service was good. If you have little ones - this is a great place. \n\nFor the kids:\nThe Kid Quest (\""baby sitting\"") was wonderful - large, lots of toys and a fun play area (slides and stuff). The staff was very nice. They called to let us know that our little guy had a potty accident so I ran over there with diaper bag and change of clothes. When I got there - they had already cleaned him and changed him, they just needed a fresh pair of clothes. How's that for service! :) Additionally, it has a full bowling alley, and Regal movie theatres. The arcade wasn't impressive (it was okay for our little guy but would probably bore teens in less than a minute). Pools were nice. \n\nFor the grownups:\nCasino nice - the smoke wasn't too bothersome for us nonsmokers. Pools were nice. Lounges were nice. Only complaint is that they should have a band/entertainment in the Rocks lounge every night (not just Friday/Saturday) for those of us who would rather sit and listen to music with our drinks - not gamble or watch sports. \n\nOverall:\nNice restaurants, nice food court. Nice place."
"This is a weekly place for  us. Same two servers (mother and daughter). This is more of a hang out. Don't go for a Parisian experience dressed in your Sunday best, it's more of a mom and pop shop to hang out and enjoy some quiet time."
"I am a Montreal native and I've had sushi at most sushi restaurants in the city, but no restaurant has been so consistently good and reasonable priced as Kashima.\nKashima has changed menus and owners several times these past few years, and needless to say, the prices have also gone up. \nDespite this, it is still among the tastiest and freshest sushi in town.\n\nI am updating my previous review and here are some comments on the sushi I had last night.\n\nSpicy tuna - one of the best rolls - fresh, perfectly balanced, and well proportioned so that you can actually eat it with the chop stick and it doesn't come part. The tuna melts in your mouth and there is just enough mayo to make it spicy.\n\nWestmount with salmon & tuna - a solid roll, a bit on the large side but thin enough so you don't make a mess while eating it. Flavourful - its deep fried edges gives it a pleasant texture without being too oily.\n\nKamikaze 3 - it was just 'ok' - I remember when under a previous owner I used to have to specially request extra crispy tempura flakes because they did not put enough - those days are long gone. Now, the roll is overpacked with them, making it way too large. Are the extra flakes being used to justify the higher prices - and being put in the place of more fish?\n\nMontreal - This roll substitutes rice with tempura flakes - a less tasty version of the Kamikaze in my opinion. Again, way too much tempura - not sure what purpose it serves. I also didn't like that I had to use my hands to eat it and that it constantly came apart in the process. \n\nI was happy overall, but until those speciality rolls become better proportioned in size, I'm going to stick to the smaller, simpler, and more traditional rolls."
"This used to be pretty good, now, not so much. The place smelled like cigarette smoke and spice. Not good. The windows were covered in handprints, the sidewalk stained with spills. The blonde waitress kept scratching her head, then went and put our stuff in a to go bag, yuck. I saw the guy preparing the food. He just reached in and grabbed some lettuce bare handed and stuck it in a to go box. That was kind of disgusting too. Real turn offs, I took the food but was too grossed out to eat it, so I just tossed it. No way I would return."
"The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entr\u00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!\n\nThat said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert."
"I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review?!  I absolutely LOVE Gilbert Dogs!  The staff is great, the Facebook videos are AWESOME, and our dog Cayla always comes home happy and exhausted.  Love the fact that we can drop off or pick up at any time of day or night.  Love, love, love this place.  We drive 20+ minutes out of the way to take our dog here, and it's SO worth it!"
"This is the best nightclub in Vegas. Now yes, the women here are just as stuck up as the women everywhere else. The men here are just as toolish as everywhere else as well. Yes, the drinks here run you about 12-18 just like everywhere else as well.\n\nHowever, even with all that being said, there is a pool you can wade in. There is an outdoor area with two outdoor bars, and gambling. Even the women have to pay to get in here, why? Becasue everyone wants to be here. \n\nThe DJ's play an ecletic mix of today's hip-hop and 90's fare, but the dance floor is crowded, and I wouldn't recommend navigating it unless you're looking for people to dance with, or you have broad shoulders. \n\nIf you get to hot on that dance floor the exspansive pool/outdoor lounge area is nice to relax at. But if you're with the right group you should have a great time.\n\nMonday is locals night and it's free if you have a NV id. However, seriously who can go out on a monday night?"
"After watching Michael Jackson's The One at Mandalay Bay I was so excited to watch Zumanity. I was hoping for energy, colour and of course sexiness, instead I got none.\n\nThe shows hosts were not funny in fact they were annoying, the crowd interaction was something you would expect to see at an all inclusive resort as part of their evening entertainment. \n\nThe show was slow and lethargic, the acrobats were a bit 'same old' and the sexiness just wasn't there. \n\nI should have took note of the people who left early but I couldn't shake that 'it has to get better' feeling."
"This place was pretty bad. We got the nutella, fruits du mer, peanut butter & bananas, and the mixed berry crepes. The only one that was good was the peanut butter. I think a lot had to do the poor quality of the ingredients. Would not go back."
Great quick lunch. Never had anything bad here. Side note the fries look burnt but are great.
This practice sends out junk mail and there is no way  to get off.  From now on I am going to write a negative review about everyone who sends me junk mail
"On our first visit, we tried the different tapas' on their happy hour menu and were not really impressed.\n\nWe came back last Sunday since I was craving for Paellla and it was a wonderful surprise that the food quality was totally different. We ordered Paella, Camarones Al Ajillo and Brochettas De Pollo and they were all good. The Camarones Al Ajillo I say is a must try. My bf almost licked the plate!\n\nWe will be back!"
"At Vegas for the first time and although I foresee and thoroughly expect rudeness,degenerates and blatant alcoholics to come my way; I have never experienced such rudeness as I have literally JUST experienced from a customer service attendant( to whom I asked a simple question; \"" where can I find the restroom\"". ) to which she responded, \"" I'm pointing at it, can't you read, it says \""\"" restroom\""\""\"", to which I responded \"" oh I'm sorry, I've never been here, so you could've just said \"" around the corner and to the right\"". \n\nVegas is designed to distract you from EVERYTHING, plus, you're given comp drink for gambling. I'm sorry if I've been enjoying my vacation. How about just say, \"" hey, it's down this hall and to the right.\"" I'll find it eventually. \nNo need to insult me or my intelligence because I am far more sober than most of these people. \nThe end. Thank you. \n\n\""Norma\"" was her name. Avoid her."
we got a room in the octavius tower.  it smelled of the drain in the shower.  we suffered through the first night because we arrived at 2 a.m.  and were too tired to complain and wait for another room.  the 2nd morning we called front desk to request for another room but we did not get one until almost 5 p.m.!  the 2nd room smelled better. but both rooms' showers were very weak.
"Very nice hotel - new, modern and non-smoking! It was nice to not have a casino here. We liked being up on the 29th floor - could see a lot. Loved the automatic shades in the room, the large shower, the quick and quietly flushing toilet, and especially the tub!!!\nPrices in the market cafe were a little steep, but that's LasVegas. I appreciated being able to get a latte there in the morning.\nWe took advantage of the free valet parking. The valets were very nice and efficient. We also got to check in early - wasn't expecting that we could but a nice surprise."
Love this place. I drive all the way from Cave Creek just so my puppy can eat all natural. Thanks for not having sugar in your treats. Good puppy heres some sugar. Not anymore Thanks again. Dakotas fav's Stella & Chewy's duck treats.
"Luv-it's customer service is the only reason I'm dropping my rating. Y'all were rude, but hot damn if you're not serving up some of the BEST frozen delights in Vegas!\n\nNew ownership means more daily flavors, a slight hike is prices, and rude service. So rude in fact that it makes me not want to return, which makes me sad because the product is phenomenal and a Las Vegas trademark. (Who doesn't like buying custard in a strip club parking lot?)\n\nTo the Asian lady that took over here's some advice.\nSmile.\nThank people.\nDon't scold your employees in front of customers.\nDon't walk away from the window when you see people walking up.\nDon't look annoyed when you have to explain things to customers.\n\nI promise you, these little tweaks will improve the energy around your shop and your customers won't have a bitter taste after the cold sweetness ends."
"Aw man, this place is all under new management and stuff.  The actual space looks way better since they remodeled, but the menu has jumped in price, but fallen in quality and quantity, and for some reason, the dirty chai was not as good as I remember it being.\n\nAlso, they stopped making their own muffins.  Now they have those huge, come-in-a-pack-of-25 ones from Costco, and overcharge for them."
"Let me start off by saying I was hesitant to try Hot N Juicy.  Now that my cherry was popped I can't stop thinking about it.  I've been back every week since the first time I went, and one week I went twice.\n\nI'm not a crawfish fan.  Maybe that is why I was so hesitant.  Nonetheless, I wanted to be open minded and faced my fears.  \n\nThere was a half an hour wait and I remember thinking- this better be worth my time!  The staff is pretty friendly and accomodating so it helped my nerves while awaiting for our table.\n\nI didn't order the crawfish but I did order the Hot N Juicy medium shrimp special as well as some corn and cajun fries.  The sauce on the shrimp was spicy, buttery and garlicky goodness.  3 things I love the most.  The shrimp is placed in a big plastic bag so the shrimp soak in all the juices from the sauce, and they put the corn (on the cob) in the bag to sit in the sauce also.\n\nOMG.\n\nSOOO good!\n\nEventually tried to expand my horizons and get the crawfish, but I wasn't a fan.  That is only because they creep me out.  So I'm a bit bias.  BUT shrimp fans rejoice."
"Buffet here is terrible on Friday night seafood buffet! Crab was so dry it wouldn't come out of the shell! And for $20 bucks per person, the Alliante Friday night seafood buffet is much more worth it!"
"Love this restaurant.  I had breakfast, lunch and dinner and not one bad meal.\n\nThe miso glazed tofu dish is amazing and I highly suggest it.  \nThe truffled grilled cheese amazing as well.\nThe strozapetti pasta deeeeeeliiiiisssssshhhhh.\nThe seared ahi salad yum.\n\nAnd, if you are there for happy hour don't miss the pickled vegetable tostada.  It is absolutely delicious and super light!  Great appetizer!\n\nService is great, d\u00e9cor is great. \n\nThis is truly a five star restaurant in my book!"
"One Monday last January in Vegas, we couldn't figure out what to do.  Wasn't really in the mood to drink (WHAT, in LV and don't want to drink???)  Yes, we partied too hard the previous weekend but.....\n\nI love Microbreweries and I always heard about the Monte Carlo Brew Pub.  So we just dropped on by.  We got there right when the kitchen was closing so we couldn't get any food.  And then when we sat down, the bartender told us that this place actually did NOT brew their own beers so it was kinda disappointing right off the bat...  \n\nBut after we ordered some beers, and the bartender was so friendly, everything turned out real good...  \n\nIt was actually 80s night so they were playing a lot of old videos on the Big Screens so what started out as a possible bad experience in fact, turned out to be a Great and very Fun Time!"
"Nice family run restaurant. Fresh ingredients well prepared. \nLove the spring rolls - loaded with fresh herbs and shrimp. Pho - well done. Good noodle dishes and most entrees shine as well. \nI prefer this place for lunch or carryout, it is very quiet at dinner time, food is still very good - but the overall ambiance is somewhat depressing."
Great car wash. Perfect location along with there other locations valleywide. Great prices for excellent washes. Only place i go customer servie is outstanding and courteous. 2 thumbs up all around
"I've never written a review before but after my experience here, I thought I would come and give my two cents.\n\nI suggested coming here with my boyfriend and his friend for his birthday since we were on this side of town. Big mistake. The hostess told us 25 minutes and we ended up waiting closer to 45 minutes. When our friend asked about the long wait they assured us that the 7 tables in front of us would be seated if we waited just 10 minutes more. I wish they would've just over estimated the time so we would be prepared for a long wait. \n\nI have never been more embarrassed in my life to suggest a place when the hostess seated us at a wet table and threw the menus down and walked away after seating us. After that, it didn't matter how hip or delicious the food was, I am never going back here."
"Decent. The dishes are somewhat bland and seem to be not quite as authentic as I have had in the past. The curry was ok and the tikka masala, well Ive had better. The buffet is above average and as always the Naan was wonderful!"
Service was exceptionally poor. \n\nWent here for a late lunch and we were the only couple in the restaurant. The waitstaff neglected us for 20minutes. \n\nThe food came out 30 minutes after we ordered and was awful! The pasta I ordered had dried out from sitting for so long.\n\nAvoid this restaurant on your next visit to lake Las Vegas.
"Stopped in for breakfast and was not that happy. \n\nFirst, let me say that I HATE the kiosks that Jack has to place your order without a cashier. I have yet to figure out how to key in \""No Mayo\"" and they don't accept coins. If your order is $5.01 prepare to get 99 cents in change back.\n\nWith that said it didn't bother me that the machine was not working and I needed to order at the counter. After some wait my order was taken.\n\nThe food was OK at best. No problems there after reminding them of the forgotten items. They might want to put a receipt on the tray and compare it to what is being served to provide people with the right food. Service was slow, but no more so than usual.\n\nI give this restaurant 1 star because it was filthy! There were more than a dozen tables in the dining room, and none had been wiped off in hours. The floor was littered with trash, as was the front counter.\n\nMore important than the mess from their current business was the build up of dirt. The walls were filthy, with sheets of lint stuck by the a/c vents. The windows were dirty, but not as dirty as the light fixtures that were layered in dust.\n\nI cringe at the thought of what the kitchen looks like, and I can safely say I never want to eat there again. I can't speak for other Jack In The Boxes, but I will think twice before walking into one."
"I have to search long and hard for things in this store that don't expire the day I'm purchasing them. They don't have a lot of the things they offer in their weekly ad, which I try to plan my grocery list around. The lines are always SUPER long. The store is always dirty. I keep telling myself I'll go to another store but there isn't another one in the 'hood to go to, so I'll need to make a better plan to head further away for a better experience in another chain. I've tried to talk to assistant managers about my issues at the store and have been blown off or they act afraid and stutter a lot. \n\nThe only good news: The gentlemen that bag groceries and collect carts are VERY nice and helpful."
"Great concept and awful hours. I like the bolanis being served right now, they're savory and one of the best ways to warm yourself up in the winter."
"Your typical Buffalo Wild Wings franchise.  TV's are placed well, and no bad seat in the place.  Drink specials most of the time, and they show most UFC and boxing PPV's."
"*UPDATE* This was originally a four star review (I deducted a star only because you have to pay an extra $0.50 to sub rice/soy milk in your latte!), but I had to change it.  I love Giant so very , very much.  The coffee is truly fantastic, the baristas are just great, and the ambiance is so perfect that I make a point of leaving my house half an hour early every Monday morning so that I can start my workweek out right - at Giant!\n\nOriginal review (after having visited only once):\n\nI can't not mention the iced honey latte, but a quick scroll through these reviews says everything that I need to say about it.  In a word:  Yum!\n\nThe place is beautiful, the staff is nice, and I love the open air design and shared space concept.  \n\nPlus, they play good music and they play it loud.  :)"
I have been coming here for several years and have always had a good experience. This is a family owned business and they all work very hard to make it a great place.
"This review, and the five stars that come with it, is for one thing and one thing only: A cocktail called \""Picoso\"".\n\nCoda and I had a light dinner and drinks here on New Years Eve 2010, and I have l been craving this delicious beverage ever since.  Every single sip was a delight. When you drink as much as I do, it's easy to get bored with the usual \""interesting\"" cocktails. I mean, how many places are going to carry Pomegranate Margaritas before people STOP getting excited when they see it on a menu?  When I say people, I mean me. I would literally take an IV of Pomegranate Margarita, I love them so much, but they've become so standard, I needed something new.\n\nThis drink they call \""Picoso\"" was interesting enough to be actually memorable. The fact that I'm even using the word \""memorable\"" in relation to New Years Eve is unheard of, considering I haven't remembered a New Years Eve since 1999. The hint of jalepeno was the perfect compliment to the muddled fruit and tequila.  This drink was enough to cut through my alcohol induced amnesia and take it's rightful place in my memories of fantastic drinks past.  I'm not even mad at the fact that it probably played no small part in me losing track of time and being in the restroom when the clock struck midnight. Oh well, I probably wouldn't have remembered that anyway."
"I love this trail, it's especially good for early morning hikes with my dogs. It's not too steep and doesn't require an immense amount of rock climbing at any point... So my little chihuahua and dachshund are able to do it without any problems.\nMy favorite part about this hike, is going off trail, you get great views of the entire phoenix area and you can do some serious rock climbing if you want. \nLike everyone else has said, keep an eye on which way you came from.....you can get lost and it's a pain in the butt trying to find your way back. \nI like this trail cause I rarely see it getting very busy (unlike camelback) and it seems like a peaceful/mild hike. \nDefinitely one I'll be coming back to."
Phenomenal service. Fresh salad and tasty soups made from scratch! I will definitely be back. They make it so easy to eat healthy.
"Let's start off with...wow...great selection for AYCE sushi!!! My group did AYCE which included appetizers, hand rolls, cut rolls and nigiri. You order from the menu so it's made to order, which means FRESH!!! We ordered baked mussels, fried soft shell crab, seafood salad, cucumber salad, fried tofu, edamame, cut rolls and nigiri. AYCE dinner is approximately $25 per person, this includes dessert. The server checked in on us constantly to see if we wanted anything else. \n\nThis restaurant is only about 10-15 min from The Strip. Well worth the drive!"
"From where I live I have to drive across town if I crave Poke. Low and behold there is a store right up the street from me. The flavor was not only awesome, but I have been craving to go back ever since.\n   Very modest looking store, but don't judge by that. The food is awesome and the prices are good.\n   Parking can be confusing. Just park across the street and carefully cross over to avoid a possible ticket.\n    I know where i'm getting lunch today."
"Maybe not as plentiful a topping selection as Yogurt Buildrz in Scottsdale but still pretty good.  Tough to see off Cave Creek Road, and only one way in and out of the parking lot is a pain.\n\nBut I found the staff pleasant and the yogurt very good.  Shop was nicely lit, comfortable and clean.  Liked the surfer theme -  I guess it's actually a woody theme but the two go together.\n\nAwesome to have this concept available closer to home here in North Phoenix."
"I really don't understand what the fuss is about with this place.  I had it years ago and thought it was horrible, but decided to give it a try again today with some co-workers. What a mistake!  First off, the food is horribly overpriced.  You can get a better bowl of pho at many other Vietnamese restaurants for half the price.  Taste wise, the pho was horrible.  It's all about the broth for a good bowl of pho, and it tasted like they just used beef broth from a can.  Additionally, the brisket smelled like it was spoiled.  Even my American co-worker thought the food tasted horribly.  This is the first time I have not left a tip at a restaurant.  It was that bad.  If you go to a Vietnamese restaurant and you don't see any Vietnamese people there, it should tell you something."
"I have been to this location several times before and normally the food has been on point and the service has been decent. But after today's trip to Panera, it pains me to leave this 1 star review, but after what occurred today I felt that it was the only thing that I could do.\n\nFirst, they were out of Broccoli Soup at 12:45 in the afternoon. I would have understood had it been later in the day sure, but you are in the middle of the lunch rush and you run out of a key item. Second was I ordered a Tomato and Mozzarella Panini and it was the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. The sandwich had 2 pieces of mozzarella cheese, 4 slices of tomato and and a pathetic amount of sun dried tomatoes. Third, the Turkey & Bacon Sandwich had no flavor what so ever. The sandwich looked like they just threw it together and there was no care to what it looked like. \n\nThe only positive of this trip was the Peanut Butter Cookie, which is sad to say.\n\nIt really pains me to say this but I don't think I will be going back to this location and may not go back to Panera because this trip has really left a sour taste in my mouth."
Nice neighborhood. We spent the day here with our dogs and 4 year old. Had no issues with either park. We will be frequent visitors.
"I was a skeptic at first, thinking that this place was luring people in with it's glossy exterior only to fall short when it comes to actual quality. I was wrong. The Valley Ho is not only fun to utilize as a word-play, it's also a fantastic hotel. \n\nI will start with the things I didn't like...because there are only a couple and they are relatively minor. \n#1 The in-room coffee. It's by far, THE WORST coffee I've ever had. I've had better cups of instant coffee. The V-Ho is trying real hard on this and I give them an A for effort. But whoever was in charge of selecting the coffee system cares a lot more about appearance and, I'd venture to guess, is not even a recreational coffee drinker. This \""thing\"" makes a cup of coffee that looks like sewar water and tastes like dasani. \nPlease, V-Ho, I beg of you to re-think your in-room coffee system. \n\n#2 Smoking at the pool. Yes, the pool is a scene, but I'm really not into having cigarette and cigar smoke wafting in my face all day. \n\n#3 There is no #3. But I wasn't really crazy about the town of Scottsdale itself. Yes, in March the weather is perfect. But the town is a you-could-be-anywhere town. All the chain restaurants. It feels a little like Disneyland, with everything setup for the tourists. Unless you're here to by art, there's nothing that you will find interesting about this place. After 1 day of looking around, I was content just to hang out and eat at the hotel.\n\nThis hotel has great rooms, the beds are superior with delicate, soft linens, a mattress that is both soft & firm, an amazing tub in the middle of the room, ample balcony space, great tv with ipod hookup, and they even brought a DVD player into my room so I could watch movies. \n\nThey also don't nickel & dime you like other hotels: wireless is free and using the gym at the spa (which is pretty good) is free. I like these little touches.\n\nThe layout of the rooms is great, you wouldn't think a tub in the middle of the room would work but it does. There's a curtain for privacy if you want it. \n\nLastly, the hotel staff were great. Helpful and friendly but not in that \""I am here to be your servant\"" kind of way. Maybe it's just me, but they actually seemed genuine. And even if that's an act, I rather liked it."
"i just made my very last trip to eides.  if it were 1992 i would have been happy to walk in the front door and just hand over all of the contents of my wallet for everything on my list of must have it now music.  but reality slapped me in the face on this past visit to PA.  i used to schedule regular meccas to this record store because it was crawling with cool books, magazines, vinyl, helpful and cool staff -oddly enough, one of the employees was the drummer on a cd i was on the hunt for.  i probably made his day when i asked him where i could find it.  but times have changed, i have witnessed the demise of all record stores for that matter.  for christsake, they were selling weird wreaths with artificial flowers and ribbons that someones grandmother probably made.  turning away from that i saw a rack with a bunch of thrift store clothes on it?  come to eides for all of your comic books needs, by all means.  when it comes to music and records and the first floor of this store, close it down already.  thanks for the memories."
Let me start by saying the guys what moved us were great but the owner had the worst customer service in the world. Rid coming from someone in the service industry. \n\nThe movers where on time and came with the right size truck. When they came into the house they said I had more stuff than just a 2 person job and they were going to call and get 1-2 more guys. When they went to the truck they found the back to be locked and the owner had the key with her. After the movers having words with the lady I got on the phone to talk with her and she proceeded to tell me that I lied about all my stuff. I told her 3 times over the 3 phone calls how much stuff I had. She had even written it down on the estimate sheet I signed. She was not very attentive to the customer. She then told me that because the truck was locked I would have to reschedule my move or wait for and hour for her to get out there and I unlock the door. I told her we needed to move and she needed to get out there to unlock the door. She then told me that her guys could start moving my things and just set them behind the truck. She wanted my things to be pit on the side of the road like garbage because her guys needed to do something. I told her they can do that but I was not paying for that time they were moving my things until the first piece was on the truck. She told me she would be there in 45 min. \n\nU never received a follow up call to see if everything as ok or if I was happy with her service. Well I will tell u only thing good about then ate the hard working guys the work about 12 hours a day with no days off because the owner is just greedy!
"oh yeah burger boiee! this place is always a great spot for a yummy burger cooked to perfection. for me, med rare with  some real redness, is only found here and they do it right! not too rare, but definitely very red for the medium and higher temp lovers. i got the standard classic burger with cheddar cheese and i totally forgot to ask for the onions to be grilled, so just lettuce and pickles. this was the best burger i have eaten in a while, and it tastes the same everytime i come back! i did try the sweet potato fries in the mixed basket and  i loved them and the shopping cart they rolled in on. there were 3 of us so we sat at the bar, about 10:30pm on friday and the service was superb! amanda was on task. i had the pear cider and was so enthralled with all the pretty pour toppers, i wanted to try every beer on tap, until i remembered i can't stand the taste of beer that tastes like beer...so there i was with my pear cider, tasting like a pear wine, sitting and starring at the shark, the devil, the animals and all those pretty enticing toppers. it made me feel bold, so i asked for a taste of the white chocolate ale, and yuckie...i was dropped flat down on reality...pooof! i do hate beer that tastes like beer, even if it has a hint of chocolate after taste. next time i come to delux, its all about the dessert menu! i was so full, as usual, that there wasn't room for dessert. but dang nab it! i had to see that there darn menu, and low and behold i couldn't believe my eyes...the delux banana split lava cake will be all mine, next time."
"We stayed here for the first time this last week. While the facility is beautiful, the customer service is horrid. A request for towels took over an hour to receive, the front desk staff don't know much about where things are when asked, when i asked for more coffee for the coffee pot i was told i had to come down and get it, and I left something behind in my room and can't get anyone there to help me get it back. The security confirmed they have my belongings but the lost and found person that I need to talk to is elusive.\n\nThe resort has shuttles to the strip, a shopping center, grocery shopping, and fremont street. Only the strip and shopping center shuttles are complimentary. Fremont Street is $15 dollars per person, it's only a few days a week, and the shuttle goes there at 5 and returns at 9 pm. The night is just getting started at 9 p.m.! Even grocery shopping is $5 each. \n\nI would not return to this resort. When I vacation I want to be somewhere with good customer service, and the Wyndham definitely isn't it.\n\n10 a.m. checkout time not so great after a night out in L.V either!"
Last time in Vegas we stayed at Luxor (for sure we will NEVER return). Room was pretty decent and clean - great price - perfect location on Strip - very decent amenities around shared with Paris. The only thing is the vent at bathroom wasn't working - for those who like shaving after shower this is very annoying - at checkout they told me to ask for South Tower next time... I will.
It is hard to want to shop at a store that allows the cashiers to be on thier cell phones while customers are in line waiting to check out. Briana turned to her cell phone and was playing with it twice with the costumer ahead of me and then again when I was checking out. She would have rather ed answered her text then take my money for my purchases. I'm not sure if safeway corp. Is aware that there are other stores around that people will go shop at when the employees care more about thier cell phones than customer service. Maybe safeway needs to impliment  a no cell phone policies  while working. Or stop hiring these kids that think they are entitled. With so many people unemployed I bet there are a lot of people that would love a job with a safeway and I bet they would do better customer service and have respect for the company and the customers.
"I went to celebrate one of my friends birthday dinner and I so disappointed. Never again will I be going eating at this restaurant. \n\nTo start off they have no parking lot so you have to park on the side of the street or wherever you can find parking and walk up to the restaurant. \n\nSecond because we were a huge group of 11 ppl we asked them several times to group two tables together (which we had made reservations days in advance) they didn't do it until they saw us trying to move the tables together. \n\nThird the menu wasn't that great. I was expecting lots of tacos, burritos, more Mexican dishes and the prices were ridiculous, I guess because it's Scottsdale. The lowest price for a plate was 14.99 which by the way while reading the menu the food did sound that delicious/appealing. I can say that the green enchilada was really good. I had the tequila lime salad and added chicken. The chicken was so dry and had no flavor. As much as I tried to finish it after awhile I had to stop eating. Margaritas were expensive and the alcohol amount in them were small. The beers were pretty cheap 4.25 though. \n\nFourth, the decor was pretty decent. Nothing too fancy we sat outside in the patio they had fans and misters which was pretty nice however they had this fireplace in the middle which I did not understand. Inside the restaurant is pretty ghetto looking for being in Scottsdale. Bathrooms were clean but really small, I felt so cram in the stall. The bar was alright but it looked dirty. The bottles on the wall looked they haven't dust them in months. \n\nFinally, the server was good he seemed really awkward and nerves. I know we were a large group and did a good job getting us drinks and our food correctly. Until the end when we were about to pay we ask to split up the tabs and he said he couldn't. After that we got irritated. We spent 30 mins trying to figure out who ordered what totaling the amounts each person owed and several ppl were paying in cash while others with their cards and what amount of change certain ppl were going to get back. We pretty much had to wait an hr to figure that out and for the server to figure it out. Not to mention that my bf and I had to pay our tab plus the gratuity tip because we were the last ones. What should have been a tab of $53 they charged us $67 (wtf). \n\nDidn't have a good experience I doubt I will ever return."
"This is a pretty nice hotel.  It's located off the strip but I would stay here because of how nice it is.  The doors to the rooms looked like apartment doors.   The rooms here look sexy.  By that I mean the decor was a chocolate brown and it gave the room a romantic vibe to it.  They have a service button you turn on and off when you want maid service for your room.\n\nThey had a nice travel guide for free in the room which I certainly took with me.  It was over 400 pages and I've never seen another hotel offer that.  I wanted to see the pool but by time we got there and finished eating, it was closed.  Boooo maybe next time."
Always fresh and perfectly prepared. This is the only place my husband will take Japanese visitors from out of town. Enough said.
"When I called, they went above and beyond to make sure I got a true quote, including coming out and checking my unit for serial numbers to check on warranty.  They were honest with the price, and they were my third quote and though a bit higher they guaranteed their work with a a year warranty.  Cooled my house down in one day in the middle of summer and called me twice to make sure it was all working!  very good honest service!"
A LOVELY BUNCH OF BONES comes with each choco box during hawlowene. if chocolate could talk it would saw buauahahaha spooooky.
Absolutely horrible!! If I could give them Zero Stars I would.  I took my daughter in for an appointment and it took two and a half hours!! We would have left had they not been sure to collect our co-pay upfront.  The staff was so inept that I knew it would never be refunded to us.  I had to go to work so my husband had to drive down and relieve me.  They actually locked them into the office and left them there while the staff left.  There is no reason to ever be this unprofessional!!
"My boyfriend showed me the menu for this place, and it seemed like a place that could potentially end up on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives, so we went to give it a try. \n\nWe ordered the big ass bacon cheeseburger, and pastrami fries to share. The food probably took around 20 minutes to make, so I got kind of annoyed while waiting. I kept telling myself it would be worth it. I wanted to try the burger because it had 12 pieces of bacon on it, and as a bacon lover, it looked pretty awesome.\n\nWhen we got the food, I dug into the pastrami fries first. The fries themselves were perfectly cooked. They were crispy and delicious. The pastrami they used was a little low quality and more on the fatty side, but I still thought that they were pretty good. The portion was huge, and I think 3 people could have shared it. They could have melted the cheese better onto the fries, but it's okay; I didn't mind too much. We also added jalapenos onto the fries for a spicy kick.\n\nThen, we started on the burger. It was the moment I was waiting for, and we cut it in half, and I took a bite. It was so overcooked that the meat was grey. I'm not even kidding. It was really low quality meat as well, probably the same quality as taco bell. It wasn't seasoned at all, and it was all around gross! The cheese had a weird taste to it; the menu said it was cheddar, but I've never had cheddar cheese that tasted like that. \n\nWhen I took a bite with the bacon in it, I literally wanted to spit it out. It was not crispy at all. I thought since we waited 20 minutes, the bacon would be nice and crispy, but no dice. It was fatty and disgusting. I did not eat more than a couple of bites. \n\nI do want to come back here and sample other stuff on the menu because the place deserves a second chance. Maybe they were just having an off day, who knows."
Internet is the worst.  On the 3rd day of our 3 day stay i figured out the only way to get a decent wi fi signal on fl 26 is in the master bathroom.  TV's are unwatchable.   The hotel has some off beat satellite system which doesn't work.  I personally spoke to one of the hotel managers and she acted like she had not heard too many complaints on these issues.  She mentioned something about the gold finish of the building affecting the wi fi signal.  Sorry Trump.  I like your tv show but your las vegas hotel timeshare project is not up to the Trump standard.
"Probably my new fav Greek spot(just wish it was closer to my side of town, but SO worth the drive).\n\nWhere to even start.... i guess by saying that everything was f*%$ing delicious! i mean everything.. the hummus, Greek fries, gyro club sandwich, the chicken, rice, potatoes...just fantastic!\n\ni will be back again very, very soon. \n\nA lot o food so be prepared to take home boxes. Also they guys that work here are very nice...so if you have questions about any the food they will be more than happy to explain them to you and not get annoyed while doing it :)\n\nwhy are you still reading this.. just go eat here already! you won't regret it. Cross my heart and hope to die."
Food are little bit salty but the service is great. If you prefer something more special to try than buffet. Stratta would be a not bad to try. I highly recommended the tata beef appetizer.
"We ate here on a Saturday night for a late night snack. The place is cute and good for people watching, but the food was disappointing. We had the french dip, hotdog and fries. Everything was on the expensive side and not very good. We would not eat here again. This was the third restaurant we tried at the Wynn and all were overpriced and mediocre."
"This was a great discovery in the South Side. It is not your typical South Side bar (which is a very good thing in my mind), and it has surprisingly good food! I think it is smoke free too, which makes it all the more appealing. I highly recommend stopping by for some sliders the next time you are in the area!"
After living in Brasil for 5 years I was very excited to try this place. I was thoroughly disappointed.  The price was way too much for their choice of meats. The night I went they weren't offering all their meats they claim to serve. Their salad bar had nothing authentic to Brasil. Quality of meat was mediocre at best. Price way too much for what you get.
"This was my first time at a El Pollo Loco, I don't know if it was this shop or all of them, but was not impressed at all. Chicken was soo over cooked it was like sawdust ... The skin was good though.   The Mac and cheese tastes like it came from a can.. Only reason I gave the extra star was because the girl who took my order was very friendly"
"We ate here last weekend. Not a long wait, all you can drink coffee pot, and GREAT food. In love with the \""healthy one\"". The crepe eggs are so good :) We will be coming back. Took away one star because we had to wait awhile to flag down our waiter to get the check."
Do not wash your car at this place. The owner Matt never answers his phone or returns calls.  He also will over charge your credit card and not make it right. This place is no good be warned.
"From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like celebrities. I wish I was one after leaving here! The food was some of the best Thai we've ever had, and I live in Chicago and have tasted dishes more than a dozen different authentic Thai restaurants. \n\nWe never were without a glass of water or a full glass of wine. I wish I lived here so I could make this a regular stop during my weekly Thai and Sushi cravings. \n\nThe Tilapia was out of this world - topped off with a delicious medley of mint, onions and lemon leaves. I highly recommend the Spring Rolls - very fresh and tasty! Give this place a try - you won't be disappointed."
"Regretfully, I haven't eaten in here yet, but due to the proximity of this fab little sushi spot to my office, I often get take-out for latenight work sessions.\n\nFirst off, the presentation.  I know it's supposed to be function over form, but the extra care the itamae put into the preparation truly shows.    \n\nSecondly, and more importantly, the fish is fresh, no one ingredient overpowers the other, and it all comes together well.  \n\nI look forward to dinner pickup at least one night of each trip to Montreal."
"Every time I layover in CLT, I always stop in the food court in the main concourse to get me some pulled pork!!  The meat quality isn't top notch, but it still tastes damn good once you add some BBQ and slaw on top!! The slaw is yummy.  So is the corn, baked beans, and Mac n cheese!! I get an extra side for $1.  Kinda pricey here, but it's the airport, and this is the better food option in the food court!  Better tasting, not better for you!!!  Platters are around $12-$15, and pulled pork sammy was $9.  But what's nice is they don't charge extra for the slaw. \nI love pulled pork BBQ & slaw! Yum."
"Looking for Sex On The Beach? Don't waste your time Nancy Boy! This is one of the best Cocktail Joints in town, that's for sure. I use it as the turning point in my night out, the mid point in the Tim J Drinker's Guide to Edinburgh - its the final farewell to classy drinking (and its all down hill from there).\n\nThese guys know their stuff, with a very particular drinks list, the decor and 'uniform' of the staff demonstrate a 100% commitment to providing a quirky-kitsch cocktail Nirvana! They have been recognised throughout the bar trade for being at the top of their game.\n\nTea cups have been trendy for a while, but these guys are no newcomers, so don't knock them for being in amongst it. You wont get a pineapple filled with pina colada, but if you ask them for a straight forward mojito or an old fashioned it will complete you. I, however, prefer to go for something straight from their list, some of which will smack you in the face and make sure you are standing to attention. \n\nTip from the professional drinker, always buy a beer chaser to maintain your rhythm, perfection takes time, and if you drink these the same way you would a straight up spirit and mixer, you will be carried out the back door....\n\nIts a very small snuggle of a place, I prefer to find a ledge to stand at as the couches will eat your sexy ass alive..."
"Food and service were rock-solid the night we were there. Serves a big menu of bistro/brasserie fare. Prices are reasonable for what you get. More importantly, the food is expertly prepared and served.\n\nLocated in a huge space with lots of tables so it was a bit on the loud side. But it seems like a great place to meet friends."
"Crappy hotel with crappy scary elevators, everything are outdated and worn out, CRT tv and no wifi!?"
"Very good sushi! I think I have found a sushi place to frequent regularly now! Everything was very fresh and creative. It seems if you like spicy sushi, this may be a place for you, but don't worry it's not all spicy, they just have some great things to try that are spicy. The sushi chef at the bar was friendly too! This place is in walking distance of my place so I am definitely going to try their 5-7pm happy hour soon. It is located right on lakeside property so you can also have a romantic dinner outside overlooking the lake, but probably want to save that for this fall :)"
"It feels weird reviewing a McDonalds again, but here we go anyway. Unfortunately I've only had the pleasure of visiting this location after hours and have had different experiences each time. \n\nSometimes they allow me to order select breakfast items off of their 24 hour breakfast menu, and sometimes they don't. \n\nSometimes they allow me to pay with my debit card and sometimes they don't.\n\nSometimes the drive thru is open and sometimes the entire restaurant is closed with no warning save for traffic cones blocking the drive thru.\n\nIn case you haven't noticed a pattern, this is the most inconsistent fast food joint I've hit up. And if you do end up ordering some food late at night,  be prepared to take a mini siesta in your car while you wait for your food order."
"Was here for dinner this past saturday night. It was great!\nThis is now quickly becoming my favorite local restaurant. The meatballs are amazing, but more so the flat breads are incredible espically the fig one.\nHighly recommend, great atmosphere and service. Now that the weather has cooled the outdoor space offers a new diamention.....cant wait to return."
Awful customer service.  They swear they are a high end store.  All I did was ask for a military discount and they swore I was robbing them or taking it out of their paychecks...come on!\nGEEZ...
"Second visit to Three Amigos, this time to celebrate a birthday and treat some out of town friends.  It was just as good as last time, though this time we had an easier time communicating with our server, who informed us that basically anything they make (enchiladas, etc.), we could get with their grilled veggie mixture instead of meat.  SCORE.  She recommended the enchiladas verde, which was FANTASTIC.  I could slurp their verde sauce with a spoon.\n\nPlantains once again instead of rice.  Seriously, they should just forgo the rice and serve fried plantains with every dish.  It could be their signature."
Tylor and Glenn were the best! I was the one that got there one minute to closing and they stayed open for me! Awesome service!
"No stars would be more like it. Management is BAD BAD BAD !!\nWe will NEVER return. \nI don't care how good the food is, BAD PEOPLE !!"
"man, i wish this place wasn't all the way in gilbert. it is so beyond good food, i can't explain it.\n\nthey've moved from the mesa location after like 20 years or something, and their customers followed.\n\nit's mediterranean style that is best described as a fusion of Greek (lots of kalamata olives, capers, feta, gyro meat), MIddle Eastern (a yogurt sauce similar to tsaziki, pita sandwiches) and italian (pastas, seafood) and it's all served in huge portions.\n\nbe warned, the owner/chef will not, under any cirsumstances, take changes or substitutions to any dish. trust me, i worked here, he' snot kidding, and you'll only piss of your server and the owner for pressing for it.\n\nthe rest. also includes a coffee bar/fresh dessert bar, and the cakes and tarts and pies are made in house, fresh daily. i recommend the baklava cheescake, to die for. dishes range in price from $6 for a sandwich (pita, and even burgers) to $18 for the pasta dinner dishes. whatever you get it's worth it! they also do wine pairing dinners for like $40 a person.\n\nthis place is unique and the food is fantastic.they have a ton of wines and lots of import beers and a full bar. would def make a good date place."
Unbelievably great.
"waitstaff very inattentive.The table next to us asked 3 different employees to take their drink/food order and each one said 'it wasn't their area' but they'd get someone right away. We wanted to order more drinks and the waitress was never around to flag her down & she didn't check back with us until she brought the check.\n\nFood was fine, but not much in the way of Irish pub food.The atmosphere is terrific!. There r other Irish pubs in the area that are MUCH better. Check them out before u trying this place"
"First off....I used to love this place. Like was there more than once a week kinda sushi spot. But now, being a little more mature and understanding of the sushi scene, I will not return.\n\nAfter events ruined a planned sushi dinner elsewhere I decided to use Kobe as my fall back sushi place and regretted every minute of it. \n\nThe service here is usually always top notch..I will give them that. BUT the menu items are just not that impressive and neither is the quality of the food. Most of which are just the usual rolls you find everywhere or variations of various tempura rolls.\n\nSo from one of my staples...to maybe if in a crunch...to not gonna donate my $ there anymore...Kobe Sushi Bistro no longer has a place in my heart...or stomach."
service is ok.\nfood is ok...actually really bland and plain. I had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breast.\nchamomile tea is the best.\n\ngood luck.
"Cuginos is a great place to stop for some good italian food. I usually do just the Pizza slice combo which is two slices of pizza and drink for 5 bucks. The pizza is pretty spot on every time. I have had better in Vegas, but its right up there in my top 5 or so. They also make great salads and sandwiches. The staff is always friendly to us when we go in. If you go in, ask Donnie if you can try a piece of their fresh homemade mozzarella. Its the best Mozzarella i have honestly ever had."
"I went here on a recent business trip, and there aren't many decent options in West Homestead, so I decided to splurge on the company's dollar and  ordered take-out.   \n\nI was highly disappointed in the service, and I only ordered take out.    Upon going to the bar to announce that I was there for take out, there were 3 other people at the bar.   The bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me.    \n\nAfter announcing the reason for my visit, she checks on my order (not ready yet) and helps other tables.  No offer of water, or a drink.  Another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink, she stated to him my order would be right up.   He then asked if she offered me a water, to which she replied, her order is going to be right up.    He placed a glass of water in front of me.\n\nThen I hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff.   3 staff members yelled. .  .\""it's TAKEOUT\""  so back it went into the kitchen to be packed up.\n\nGentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet (she had not)\n\nAfter more time had passed (how long does it take to put food into a takeout container?)   it finally is put down in front of me.  She then rings me up.   I don't expect take out to be piping hot, but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be room.\n\nWhen i go to eat my meal, utensils were not included.  I now had to go find something to eat my lukewarm food with. \n\nVERY DISAPPOINTING experience.   Will not be returning."
"Food prepared wrong. Charged for things that we supposed to be complimentary as per our waitress, including entrees and deserts. Not going back to this place!! Manager said she would fix things but didn't."
"Full trash bins, over charged for free drink with sandwich purchase, unfriendly man working today.  \n\nThis is not what I am used to for a QT."
"Stright up & honest!!!!! After I took my vehicle to other shoe makers that were not qualified to work on a Big Wheel I found this place. The gentlemen in this establishment don't play around, absolutely flawless work at half the price of any other shop in town!!!! If you read my other reviews you will see places to stay away from."
"Ew. Okay, not the worst pizza ever, but it's pretty far down my list of pizzerias...and that's sad, considering I quite literally live across the street from it. This should be my go-to pizza destination but I'd rather pay a delivery charge than eat their pizza. The sauce is way too sweet (like, Papa Johns sweet) and there isn't enough cheese. There are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this. The only thing I enjoy about Pizza Perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims, \""Excitingly flavored!\"" Personally, I wasn't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza. Maybe if they wouldn't have tempted me with such language I would be less pissed off at them. Two stars only because they let me borrow some paper cups when I moved into my apartment and hadn't unpacked my kitchen stuff yet. Without them I may have had to travel half a block north and grab some from a different restaurant. Thanks, Pizza Perfectta.\n\nOh, and here's a little Italian lesson for you: it's \""perfetta,\"" not \""perfectta.\"""
Ordered a pizza to go very light on toppings and sauce asked to reorder said no not very good customer service
"Maybe we just went on a bad day last December when everything was closing early due to snow. However, they had some cool games but it would have been crazy to pay for a full day when we could only play for two hours. \n\nThe bathrooms were disgusting and the entire place smelled of raw sewage. I felt like I was in the French Quarter in New Orleans!"
"I was told the rooms were renovated but was a basic clean up... Still has popcorn on the ceiling, clean but not anything fancy. Flat screen tv was terrible reception, heat and air is old and is loud and outdated. Very old casino that dates back to 1955 and is a good place to stay if you like vintage. Does not have a good filtration in the casinos and smoke is strong smelling. Would never, never stay here again... Never!"
"This place can make you a bit claustrophobic, especially if you've frequented the  LV North Premium Outlets. Here's how it sizes up:\n\n-Easier to park (but you might get stuck in some traffic due to lack of stop lights)\n-Indoors so you can find some sanctuary for those hot Vegas summers (but it feels kind of claustrophobic inside)\n-A lot of store selections (but I feel like the selection is much bigger at the North outlets)\n-More food options compared to North outlets, including surrounding food options\n-lacks that \""touristy\"" vibe, so less tourists looking lost or toting their luggage\n\nDespite the hassles of the North outlets, I still feel like I'd rather shop there. Although it was nice being indoors, it was easier to get to the main stores we wanted to go to by walking outside the building, but our trip was ultimately a bust."
"This place is HORRIBLE!!! WORST SERVICE, EVER! We waited 55 minutes for our delivery, which was supposed to only take 30 minutes. We live 7 minutes down the road. We called to find out where our delivery was, they said they were \""on the way\""... No apologies, no \""let me find out where the driver is and I will call you back,\""....Well, when they FINALLY delivered our italian beef sandwich it had the au jus spilt all over the bag. The other au jus didn't even have a lid and was also spilt, there was about 1/4 of it left. The sandwich was disgustingly soggy. They completely forgot our salad. When we called, we spoke to the manager who said they would give us $1.00 back for the salad, and would send us another sandwich, but refused to refund us. We didn't want another sandwich, we wanted our money back by this point. We even said we wanted our money back because this was disgusting and there was no way we wanted to eat a soggy sandwich!! WHYYY would we want to wait ANY LONGER for another order?? We wanted our money back so we could get the sandwich we wanted from someplace we know has good service. NEVER will I EVER go here, ever again!"
"It was fated that Bachi Burger and Us would meet last Sunday at the Las Vegas Valley Book Festival's \""Feasting on Words\"" Event.  I read about it on Yelp, went to check it out and was pleasantly surprised to see such a well-organized event that evoked a sense of community, somewhat unusual for Vegas.\n\nBachi Burger chefs were among other local restaurant chefs there, slaving over an open grill to serve fresh food representative of their venues.  Bachi was serving these miso sliders that really stood out above the rest.  Kobe patties topped with fried quail eggs sandwiched between warm soft buns had me wondering why I never went to their restaurant before, especially since I live less than five miles away.\n\nWe made our trip tonight and I am now so thankful to have been paying attention to Yelp events.  The restaurant is minimally decorated, modern and clean, fitting for an Asian-inspired gourmet burger joint.  \n\nWe started with the parmesan truffle fries, which were very tasty, crispy (not burned) and not too greasy.  I really liked the Bachi pickles, which were a combination of pickled veggies: radish, onion, carrots.  They provided the addictive sodium and crunchy companion for the fries and burgers, which were worth the wait.  (I've read reviews that the service can be slow here; ours was not slow, but longer than many other burger joints, which make sense to me since these burgers taste like they were made with much care and effort).\n\nThe Vietnamese in me desired the Banh-Mi burger, and the Vietnamese in me was right.  The Banh-Mi was a culmination of flavors: sweet from the Vietnamese ham (cha lua), salty from the fish sauce, tart from pickled cabbage, and spicy from the chili peppers.  All of this were served between two pate-covered buns, a perfect harmony.\n\nI was too full for dessert, but am looking forward to trying the Portuguese donuts with Saigon cinnamon on my next Bachi experience.\n\nBefore we left, my boyfriend said, \""We should be careful who we bring here, since we may run into them all the time from then on\""."
"Visited El Encanto with some friends for lunch the first time last week.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere.  We sat inside with a view of the pond and the ducks.  The service was good and the food above average.  \n\nThe green salsa is fantastic with a wonderful flavor.  The chips are fresh and they are happy to refill as you request.  I ordered the carnitas which were terrific.  Others at the table had the carne asada, the fajitas and the pollo fundido.  Good reviews on the food from everyone.  Portions were generous and we all left with no room for dessert.\n\nGreat place for lunch or dinner.  The restaurant has a nice feel and  you certainly won't leave hungry."
"I wish I could give less than one star. There is no communication between the staff, their attitudes are poor at best, their reception is sloppy and they are commonly overbooked, and they frequently change insurance policies without contacting their patients about having to find a new office. I have never been so disgruntled with an office experience in my life and I would highly recommend finding absolutely anywhere else to take your business."
"Everything they said it would be! Starting with the consult; they were polite and helpful in providing me with the best options to suit my concerns. Dr. Friedman was very professional and the entire process was pain free for me, both physically and mentally. The procedure went off without any problems. The entire staff was helpful before, during and even now after the surgery.  I have thought about having this done for a long time and after my consult with Carly, I felt like this was the time. I couldn't be more satisfied."
"While not nearly as big as Scottsdale Fashion Square, Kierland Commons is a good eating/shopping destination if you are in North Scottsdale.  If you are staying at the Westin, you can easily walk, drive, or take the free Westin shuttle.\n\nThe design and layout tries to evoke the idea of a small town center with streets running through the mall.  It's compact enough that even old folks or people with kids can walk around the whole thing without feeling overwhelmed (assuming it's not too hot).  The stores are all mid- to high-end with a range of things from fashion (Guess, Michael Kors) to home goods (Sur La Table, Crate and Barrell), and the restaurants range from family friendly chain restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, P.F. Chang's) to local restaurants (North, Greene House) to high end steak/fish house (Mastro's Ocean Club)."
"Portions are made for giants here. Ordered the meatloaf hash, thought it could have been seasoned better, only ate about 1/10th of the 10\"" x10\"" 3 inch high skillet filled to the brim and then I couldn't even stand to look at it anymore. I highly recommend the Chicken and Waffles! The chicken was so moist and infused with rosemary, best fry chicken I've ever had. And the waffles are heavenly with a thick cut of bacon right inside! The waffles were substantial but yet fluffy, perfect texture. Everything comes together with a scallion glaze that's both savory and a little sweet, it goes perfectly with the waffle, bacon and fried chicken. No wonder it's the NYTimes favorite."
I like almost everything about LVAC except that sometime the workers are cleaning the pool area while I'm trying to relax in the jacuzzi. I don't like water splashing around and the smell of the sanitizer.  Note: It was not during the cleaning hours that is posted.
"3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. Partially because, lets get real, there are limited dim sum options here in Las Vegas. I was introduced to dim sum when I lived in the Bay area, so my standards are a little higher than your average bear.\n\nCame in for an early dinner at about 6PM.\nLove how they have the cart ladies circulating around with goodies- so many places in SF simply have you order from the menu and only have carts on Sundays or lunch service. Here you can do carts and also order menu dishes if you want.\n\nWe got probably half the menu, including shrimp shu mai (tasty), shark dumplings (have to try), shrimp noodle roll (personal fave), fried shrimp ball (BF's fave), crab ball (star of the night, at $7/a pair), steamed pork bun (mediocre), chinese broccoli (must-have) and duck (which we didn't need at all but was tasty- especially with the sauce).\n\nMade the mistake of ordering the soup dumplings, which they said would take 10 minutes- and we waited and waited and waited. And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one).  The lady told us they were \""coming right out\"" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again.\n\nWe spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits. It's probably also why we only have dim sum once every month or two. Dining room is nice, much larger than expected though you san see it's a large place from the outside. Service was friendly and attentive throughout, other than that ridiculous wait for the soup dumplings."
"I would give negative stars if possible. Absolute worst experience ever. I contacted Wardley real estate because I found a house I was interested in while browsing on realtors.com. I contacted the listing agent.  And was linked up with the worst realtor ever Greg Hicks. He was the most unprofessional agent I have had to deal with. Not once during the Three month period of my short sale did he contact me to update me on anything. I had to call him and when I did he never had an answer for me he always said \"" I'm going to have to ask the selling agent, I'll get back to you\"" but he never would. So I finally began contacting the selling agent Jennifer hill who is the 2nd worst realtor ever!. She was very unresponsive never returning my messages. Finally when my purchase agreement expired I quickly canceled my agreement a requested my earnest deposit back which took them weeks to even get them to get the owner to sign (BS).  They gave me the run around constantly and were full of it. If I ever see a property listed under Wardley I will run the other way. Oh ...and Jeff Sommers was of no assistant as well. Wardley real estate is a complete fail."
Totally edible chain restaurant food. Nothing exciting.
"Closed kitchen early because they were slow.  Manager \""Johnny\"" is a loser. We had a groupon and he would not honor it.  Hate to say this but we would never try this place again even though we lost 17.50."
I've always been a happy camper leaving this place. \nThey have a very cool looking bar with their bottles lit up and colorful. I like sitting at the tables around it even though the lighting is bad. It's like the flashlight under your face effect. Not cute!\nI prefer the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna for the appetizer. The tuna comes out on a slaw that tastes amazing with a soy dressing and a side of wasabi you can mix in. This isn't a fish restaurant but I get on a fish-kick and LOVE their Blacked Fish Sandwich. It's always cooked perfectly and really like the sauce. The steamed broccoli are big pieces and always fresh. I wouldn't recommend the honey roasted carrots - they are soaked in whatever they are calling honey roasted and just tastes like carrots coated in sugar. Yuck. \nI like dessert and like chocolate but don't like anything from here. Maybe too much white chocolate for me.
"Very dissappointed with the customer service. Went there on Friday, 11/15/13 with my family. The waitress spent most of her time trying to upsale. She encouraged us to get extra cream cheese with out pollo con queso (in which we ordered 3). We did, and of course we were charged for the extra cream cheese. My son ordered the kids meal and I explained to her that it comes with a free drink. She already inputted the charge and stated that she would speak with her manager. She never removed the item from the bill. Normally, we overtip on our bill. We usually leave approximately 15% if the service was poor. We left an $11 tip on our bill that was $70.44 ($81.44 after tip) due to the poor service. I checked my bank account today and noticed that our waitress added an extra $1. Total amount charged was $82.44. Ajo Al's just lost a customer for life."
"One of the best comic shops in Arizona. The staff is always friendly and willing to help you find anything and everything. If they don't have it they'll try to order it.\n\nKen is a wealth of knowledge. \n\nSusan is super helpful and loves \""Lock and Key\"".\n\nDaniel is all about the customer service. He loves trying to find the best books for all that come through the doors.\n\nJason loves Superman! And is a huge fan of the show Community.\n\nChris is hilarious and loves to help everyone.\n\nGabe is all about Batman!\n\nIf you're in the area and looking for a great place to hangout and talk about almost anything, this is a great place.\n\nThey always have great events planned. Everything from book clubs to card games. They have signings and art classes whenever they can. Ken does a great job of gathering local talent for all of they're special events."
"Shame on International Marketplace,\nthey erase and create their own expiration\ndates on some of the food products.\nI confronted them on this, they were speechless\nwhen I removed an expiration date sticker\nshow the item was already expired!!\n\nThey also have the worse customer service I have\never seen!!!\n\nAlso beware of the filipino aisle, most snacks are expired, and they have no expiration dates!"
"I have been going here for about a a year and a half now and I love this place. I bought a groupon originally and have been going back with my membership card, best groupon I ever bought. I usually see 'Shay and she is amazing. She applies the right amount of pressure and I love the oils and scents she uses. All of the therapists I have seen have been great. Everyone is always really friendly, they do a great job of creating a relaxing environment. \n\nThe only slight drawback I have seen is sometimes my 1 hour massage will run a little short. I have been there a few times when the therapist was running a little behind and my appointment started late, which is fine, but it still ended on the hour. \n\nI will also say they have a very easy and convenient online booking system."
"Best Poutine!!!\nThis is, hands down, the best place to grab a Poutine. They serve their Poutine on Belgium fries which elevates it to the next level. The fries alone are delicious!"
"Best wine bar in Phoenix!! I stopped by after grabbing some BBQ and it is such a relaxing and cozy shop. We weren't sure what type of wine to get, so the owner stopped by to give us some recommendations. He introduced us to an awesome wine and we enjoyed it while listening to some live music. I think the best part of it all is how affordable it is. You can really enjoy some unique wines and have a great time with your friends!! Make sure to give it a try"
"Don't go here if you need anything. They tried making it into a super Walmart but failed miserably.  There is no one around and if you need anything, go to the other two walmarts that are 3 miles apart, in the opposite direction. Super fail."
"I have been to Porta Bella several times over the years.  Why I've gone there more than once I just don't know.  I just want so badly to like this place but every time it truly disappoints.  The only thing it has going is the semblance of a romantic atmosphere (although that's really only due to the low lighting).\n\nMy last trip I had the pasta primavera, artichoke and spinach ravioli in a pesto sauce and sauteed veggies.  The only problem was that there were 3 itty bitty raviolis in the entire dish.  Trying to find them was like an archeology dig amongst unfresh and limp veggies.  \n\nNext time you walk past the place do yourself a favor and just keep walking.  The sub-par food and service aren't worth your time or money."
"Make sure to bring your fist bumping attitude, if you're stopping after a night out in downtown Scottsdale.  They actually have a DJ blasting music, making for a bad transition from bar scene to food shop.\n\nAt night the place was quite crowded and clearly housing a lot of intoxicated peeps.   Even after a few drinks, the Phlilly sandwhich was whatever.  Add their spicy sauce to make your sandwich something to contemplate about.  As a hangover local, its worth the walk, as pure foodery, it was subpar."
"Needed to find a handyman to help me fix up a short-sale home I purchased in Mesa.  I live in Washington state, so don't know anyone there.  Received recommendations for handymen from my realtor and a couple other people, but none of them were available the week of Christmas when I was there.\n\nIn desperation I hit the internet and found ELI THE HANDYMAN via his website.  Best find I could have hoped for!  E-mailed Eli, then we spoke on the phone the same day.  He was prompt to e-mail a written bid, and was set up to take payment via credit card.  Nice when you're from out of town as I am!\n\nEli proved to more than I could have hoped for.  He lined up a house cleaner, painter & tile crew, plus he and Dana (his employee) met me there Saturday morning at 8:00 AM to get the ball rolling.   He took Sunday off (don't blame him!), then he and his painter worked all day Monday (Christmas Eve...amazing!).  The rest of the week he worked tirelessly replacing ceiling fans, repairing water damage, installing new doors  and more things than I can remember.  Eli even got me a discount on the paint.\n\nI give Eli my highest recommendation.  He's ethical, knows how to do most anything, is fair in his pricing and has great subcontractors to call in for specialty work.  Couldn't be happier in my overall experience with Eli the Handyman.  He's now in my phone contacts, and I will call him every time I need work done.\n\nLee Ford"
Not sure how good the food is going to be but 45 minutes to get it is unacceptable. No apologies at all from the staff either. Finally got our food. Not worth the wait.  Skip it!
"This is one of the worst restaurants I've ever tried to order from.  They take 2 hours to get you delivery, they always screw up the my order and they have no clue how to give good service.  Every time I've worked with them, they've screwed something up and they've never tried to make it right.  If Madison had any other food options, I would never order from them again."
"I came here for the first time today because I wanted to treat myself to a nice breakfast at a different spot then usual.  I've known about TC's before, but never bothered to go in, until now.\n\nI really liked it here.  It kind of had a country/midwestern feel, with a large amount of seating and a really nice staff.  I was greeted and seated immediately, and the place was packed!  I kept it simple and went with the eggs over medium, potatos and toast, along with some coffee and water.  The service was great, and all the staff was friendly and helpful.   Food was tasty, and prices were good.\n\nI would gladly return in the future, and most likely bring my mom here next time shes in town.  Great little place for breakfast!"
"Ok this place is great. I love the shrimp cocktail, and the chimichangas are  amazing too!  Try the guacamole!  Also anything with shrimp seems to be above par!\n\nEveryone on the bar staff is really friendly but by far my all time favorite is Erica!  She seriously kicks ass!  She's super nice and works to keep everyone going at a good pace."
"Decent cover charge but a huge clusterfuck. There's no waiting around at this club. If you're caught standing still by the bouncers, they'll waive their LED flashlight on your ass to keep things moving. The DJs probably get wasted too because toward the end of the night, it sounded like stop n'play mixing between songs with no cohesive mixing skills whatsoever. I expected more from such a hyped up Vegas hotspot."
"I like this Basha's.... its local, and convenient. I don't think they are the cheapest place in town to shop... but it's around the corner from where I live.\n\nI also like supporting local Arizona business.\n\nThe staff at this Basha's is always very friendly, and I like to frequent one store so you get to know the staff. \n\nThey often run a $10 dinner \""combo\"" package that is a really fair deal if you don't feel like cooking. You get to pick from different items and piece together a meal for $10. Not bad to feed a family of 4."
"At $10 per adult, you can't really go wrong here. We spent probably a little over 2 hrs at the museum and felt it was well worth the price of admission. I enjoy American History, and this was no exception."
This was a great spot to take a break from it all and just people watch.  We sat at the bar facing the casino and we were entertained the whole time.  The mini grilled cheese (appetizer) was fantastic. It came with a tomato based dipping sauce that was the perfect compliment to the bite sized wedges.  Tip - ask for two dipping sauces because one just won't do.
"Herbs and Spices OH MY!!!\n\nEvery Spice, Herb, baking ingredient you can imagine is here and the quality is just superb! I will never waste my money at any other place on spices or herbs...because unless they are Penzey's they are a waste of money!\n\nI personally love there Cumin, their extracts, Vanilla and Almond, and their many Cinnamon Choices, are the most amazing quality and are worth every penny. \n\nI look forward to every visit to the store so I can try a new item each time I go. I keep a list in my spice cabinet to make sure I never run out and so I never have to rush off to the grocery store for a spice while cooking...God forbid I run out of my Penzey's Spices!!"
"this review is solely based on the way the line is managed at Tryst...\n\nUGH...UGH...UGHHHHHHHH!!!\n\nheard so much about this place and TRIED to give it a try...  was here for xmas and new years 09 and figured it was the time for a tryst.  got all dolled up and headed over to hop in line..which felt like a mile long!  oh, that's because it WAS a mile long, and this was early - like 10:30!   the friggin line did NOT move AT ALL for more than an hour .....  i tried to maneuver over to the rope on the left to see if I could bat my eyelashes at a bouncer so I could get in faster, to no avail.  Maybe this is because I still had my overcoat on (as it was winter, I am not one to walk all the way from PH with bare arms) but WTF they don't even have a separate girls only line?  What's the point of having a pass if you can't even use the effin thing, or get someone's attention to tell them you're trying to use one.  Since I was by myself and its a lot harder to attract the attention of bouncers with one hot girl as opposed to 10 hot girls, I finally gave up and went to the craps tables.\n\nI would love to get in there and see this fancy waterfall they got goin on, but I'm not going to stand around like an idiot for the privilege of spending MY money and standing around aimlessly in a club.  I'm good on that.  Not even sure if I would try to go here again since the Wynn is not located in a spot that I feel like walking to or taxiing from, and they obviously don't value their customers' time or opinion."
"Chinese run crepes?\nHmmm...\n\nBrisk service, balanced seasonings and light creperie...\nWorked well as a second breakfast before running out back on the town.\n\nThe decor was minimalist and tasteful... great work in a very demur and non-ostentatious mode."
Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish.
This is one Buffet that we love to go to mainly because of the Great food and fantastic service not mention the excellent ambience
"Super fun!  Great people watching!  Very nice and attentive staff.  Drinks were good, looked like the food was too!    Like I mentioned AMAZING people watching here.  \n\nIt's definitely an adult pool, no kids at all."
What a shame the groupon was the only reason I give it a star to begin with.  The meal cost us nothing but the food was worth nothing to begin with. \n\nThere was no flavor to the sushi and the service was poor.
Came on a Saturday night to enjoy the free bubbly for an hour. No problem getting in for us local ladies..got my wristband for the free booze & it was on. The club is actually very small but it's laid out perfectly. Bathrooms are easy to access. My favorite part was the outside patio area. It was a beautiful night to sip our free drinks outdoors. We were able to sit at one of the reserved tables for about an hour til they needed it for bottle service. It was nice to be able to sit while we got our drink on. After that we went inside to shake our ass to some pretty decent music. Thankfully hip hop was not being played to much. We had a super time there even tho they don't have a designated dance floor. I highly recommend this place as a 1st stop on the club circuit.
"The food was way better than I expected. I've eaten here once before a long time ago but didn't remember it being as good as it was. We sat at the bar for a couple of drinks. The micheladas here are DELICIOUS!!  I'm not sure what they do differently, but they're so good. And at full price, they're only $5, but we were here during happy hour so they were $2.50 a piece. That's a win!\n\nWe wanted to get a table but the hostess told us there was a 15 min wait, and after 20 minutes we decided to just get food at the bar. It was weird because it wasn't even busy. Our bartender was awesome though, so it all worked out. He gave us chips and salsa to start, but the chips were a bit stale. I got the \""pick 3\"" combo of a carne asada taco, carnitas taco, and machaca beef enchilada. Everything was so delicious.  The machaca beef is like barbacoa and it was my favorite.\n\nIf you want to just hang out at the bar and have a decent meal and great drinks for super cheap, this is a great place."
Not sure what the fuss is.  Lame sandwiches.  Much better options on the strip.
"This is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I had 3 flights delays for 2 hours or more!!! I miss some very important business, which cause me to miss hundreds of dollars and personal event dealing with my family. I'm going write more complaints on yelp and anywhere so other future clients don't make a mistake to purchase a flights with US Airways!!!!\n\nIt's 8pm 12/6/14 and now my flight has  been cancelled\nI been at the airport since 4pm"
"I've been to this place several times over the past month now and as far as Sushi experience i'm very happy. Let me first point out that I love the reverse happy hour that they do between 8pm-10pm. Prices on meals are incredibly cheap. My wife and I usually end up getting out the door with a few plates and drinks for 25 bucks. The pricing I think is wonderful.\n\nThe service is also excellent. It's usually not long even with a packed restaurant to get your food. Service seems to be very attentive my drink gets near 1/4 and the server is around to check if I want a refill and need anything. They take plates as you finish them and im not left piling them up at the side of the table hoping someone will pick them up like at other restaurants.\n\nOverall i've been happy with just about every dish from this place. I don't claim to be a Sushi expert, but no dish thus far has been distasteful or of poor quality. I really like the crab rangoons for an appetizer, and the blue flame and golden Buddha are great. \n\nOverall i'm very happy with this restaurant and I enjoy my experiences here each time that I go."
"Twice in the past week we have been to this place and the juices are AWESOME!!!!  The smoothies are good as well and the food compliments.  It has been a while since we were here before these last two visits and it was great to see they expanded the inside and really made the place look nice.\n\nWe have always enjoyed the food here and now with the juices & smoothies, this place is one at the top of the list.  They have great food, great customer service and a place you should try.  \n\nIn closing, I have never had a bad experience here and doubt I ever will....A must to your list..."
"Decided to try this salon based on the reviews, Angel did my pedicure and she is fabulous I will defiantly be back to see her! My nails look great also I love the selection of color gel they have. Overall nice salon and believe me I'm extremely picky"
"This is our nth time visiting Vegas and earlier in the day we had our customary buffet on the Strip.  It was 7pm and because we had way too much meat and crab legs for lunch, we thought a nice salad dinner was a must.  \n\nGetting here from the Strip takes about 15 min. w/o traffic.  Be sure to take the \""82B\"" exit from the I-95.  It will lead you straight into the humongous shopping center and Sweet Tomatoes will be right behind Applebees.\n\nI have to admit I'm a regular at the Souplantations in the OC.  My favorite item there is the Clam Chowder, but for some reason Sweet Tomatoes (which is pretty much the same thing as Souplantation w/ a different name) does not offer this soup.  Because of this tiny little detail, I couldn't give it 5 stars.\n\nThe veggies were fresh.  Chocolate lava cake, that's only offered after 4p, was delish.  And the lady who took away our dishes was kind enough to bring us a plate of freshly baked cookies.  The staff overall was very polite and that made the whole dining experience pretty darn great."
"I don''t understand (and never have) what the fuss is all about.  This place has always been talked up as the zenith of cheap, delicious breakfast.\n\nCheap?  Yes.\nDelicious?  No.\n\nThere are so many diners in Madison where you can get a cheap breakfast that actually TASTES GOOD.  Everything there is too greasy and under-seasoned.  How do you manage to screw up eggs scrambled with cheese??  Their pancakes are bigger than dinner plates, but they're thick and dry and almost inedible.  I've given this place more than 3 tries and I come out disappointed every time."
"Five stars for the OMG AMAZING superfood salad (super is right)!!!  I hope they never, ever take this off the menu...not even in a zillion years.  It's just so lovely and exactly what I have been missing at nearly every other restaurant in the UK.  People often ask me what I miss about home (US) and the only thing I say without hesitation is, \""the entree salad.\""  Why is it so rare here to find a salad that is not only big enough to constitute an entire meal, but is also GOOD?  Well here at Pizza Express, of all places, I have finally found it.  This was my first time ever in a Pizza Express.  There's apparently one in George Square, but I've been spending all my culinary energy in that part of town at Pintos...not any more I won't!\n\nThree stars for the ho-hum service.  Nothing remarkably bad about the service, but certainly nothing stand-out amazing.  So four stars it is for Pizza Express - imagine my surprise!"
"Disappointing... I went in to kill some time and check out the shop, and will not be going back. The layout looks like an indoor yard sale, there is an \""old stuff\"" aroma, and the sales staff looked like they hated being there. Not a great experience at all..."
"so its taste mtl week and i was looking for new places to try. places that had decently good reviews so this one caught my eye.\n\nRSVP is extremely easy with open table and a call back the morning of your reservation to confirm. easy as pie!\n\nbeautiful downstairs dining room with a bar overlooking the kitchen where you can enjoy watching cooks preparing the apps (and drool over some of them) or peak in the kitchen. there's a dining room upstairs too but i have no idea what it looks like.\n\nservice is attentive, waiters are extremely friendly and helpful. it wasn't rushed. after finishing my main, they didn't bring dessert out until i was ready which was like 10-12 minutes later.\n\nas for appetizer, i got the ostrich neck terrine with a foie gras surprise alongside some fresh greens, chopped chestnut, caramelized onions with slices of toasted baguette. it was definitely good with the many notes of flavor. it made me want more of it.\n\nfor main, it was the roasted salmon over a bed of cabbage, dulse gremolata and hareng-cini. the salmon was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and incredibly moist. 30-45 seconds less and it could be considered raw. the hareng-cini was crispy but lacked that something.\n\nand to finish it off, a chocolate caramel fleur de sel tart with confit butternut squash and pumpkin seeds (if i remember correctly). loved the squash and its accompanying sauce. enjoyed the caramel kick to the tart. as for the chocolate part, good but not rich enough.\n\nto accompany my main, i got their suggested wine that paired perfectly with the salmon.\n\nprice wise, with the glass of wine and after factoring in tips, you're looking in the neighborhood of $65. that's for their taste mtl menu. outside of that, expect to pay more.\n\nall in all, it was definitely good food that is perfectly cooked/prepared but it was missing that something. that je ne sais quoi that would definitely make you want to come back. i didn't get that feeling. instead, it was more of a \""i may consider this place if out with a bunch of friends looking for some french cuisine\""\n\nps. by sitting at the bar, i got a good look of the mackerel app with squid ink. it looks and sounds even better than the ostrich app"
"This is a pricey place with good appetizers only (food was bad).  The hot n sour soup was ok but tasted nothing like the Chinese version.  Pot stickers were good as was the sampler appetizer dish.\n\nThe scallops I had reeked of fish sauce which I dislike and the spicy shrimp dish was ok.  Even with a Groupon, I will not return (well only to try happy hour) - I will go to the outstanding Jade Palace just down the road instead.\n\nThey ripped me off by charging the adult price for the $1 kids drink and the waiter Christopher said he would adjust the price.  They brought back my credit card receipt w/o the adjustment - wasn't even worth the $2 they overcharged as I just wanted to get out of there.\n\nOn the positive side, it is a nice indoor setting and the outdoor patio looked nice."
"First of all, it's an absolute crime that in a city this size, there are not cabs available on the street.  In one of the main bar districts, at 2-3 am when places are closing up, there are no taxis patrolling around?  Seriously??  Do you actually WANT to make money or are you just in business as a hobby?\n\nSecond, how about when we call for a cab, you actually fucking send one, assholes?\n\nWe waited thirty minutes and called again, received assurances that the cab was on its way, waited another fifteen minutes, and then gave up.  Thanks to Yellow Cab, we had to hoof it 1.5 miles back to our hotel, which normally would not be the end of the world, but it was 3:30 am, we were all dead tired, and my one poor friend has a bum knee.  \n\nSo fuck you, Yellow Cab.  I'm putting the Green Cab number in my phone and we'll be trying them next time."
This place makes a Las Vegas trip complete!\n\nWe had the dinner buffet and it exceeded our expectations. They have a wide selection of food as well as world class dessert chefs. The seafood was all very fresh too.\n\nThis is a must eat buffet if you're in Vegas. The price is worth it. Come hungry!
The music sucks! Dj was really bad. Bunch of guys and not enough females. Dance floor too crowded
"Great balkan style lunch menu!\nExcellent Hummus, fresh salad and vegetables and the chicken skewers were also very well seasoned.. But a little bit dry.\nService was very friendly! :-)"
"Stayed here for my bachelorette party. I didn't pay for it so that probably helps a little bit with the rating.  I knew this wasn't going to be a great hotel or anything but I was still a little excited to stay there just because it's so random and funny to stay in a pyramid shaped hotel.  \n\nWell, the elevators are weird and not in a fun way.  For some reason, I thought they would be glass so you could see out.  Not the case.  They move upwards at a diagonal angle which is unsettling when you're sober and nausea inducing when you're drunk.  Our room was ok.  Nothing to write home about but no problems either.  The windows and slant of the room make it seem much smaller than it probably is.  \n\nCheck in was easy and quick.  Tacos N Tequila restaurant had good guacamole and a bachelor party there bought us Patron shots.  So that was good.  \n\nGambling was ok, again nothing exciting.  \n\nWe went out by the pool one afternoon.  It was so hot and there was no shade.  At a certain point in the afternoon, the glare coming off the pyramids was horrible.  Also, I don't need to look at a larger than life size poster of Carrot Top when I'm trying to relax.  \n\nOverall, it was ok but I don't think I would ever pay for their weekday prices or would be in a rush to stay there again."
Very good meal -- a la carte dinner. And service above and beyond. Must go back for the buffet.
"This is the place to go if you feel like being talked down to by some big fat bouncer while your waiting in line. Oh wait \""there is no line, its first come first serve\"", replied big fat bouncer as we mentioned to him that there was a big group pf people who cut us in the front of the line. He will also tell you to \""get off the ropes, or I won't let you in.\"" Really dude! The line was pushed up against a gambling table with no room for anyone to move. I would like him to stand behind in the line and see if he could keep his fat bum off the ropes! Anyways, our group decided we had better things to do than to sit in this line and listen to this rude fat bouncer. You don't need Drais for a good time in Vegas, there are so many other good spots to go where you won't deal with  poor customer service like this!"
"No thanks.  I'm not really even sure how to describe the Barnyard Flea Market.  We drove by several weekends in a row and were astonished by the amount of people this place packs in so we decided to give it a try.  We were hoping to find some small furniture pieces or decor items.  Umm..not here.  Old paint, used shoes, Avon perfume from 1985, push up bras, womens shape wear with cut-out butt cheeks - yes.  Items of real value - no.  It is just a strange conglomeration of junk in my opinion.  \n\nThe booths that did appeal to me were the fruit/veggie stalls featuring many latin american items for a decent price.  That would be worth going for it you were looking for a hard get item like cactus leaves or cactus flowers.  Other than that, not worth the trip."
"Came a few days ago for a lease, wasn't sure of size needed, so I guessed, three times! Finally got it right, but hey, the store didn't bat a eye lash when I returned the ones that didn't work, they just asked if I needed help picking out a replacement. \n\nSince my cat has been loosing weight, I could not get the size down, so after my attempts, finally got the small dog size and sure enough it worked. Now to get the cat used to it before we need it. \n\nThis store has everything you could need. They is even a new section by Martha Stewart, everything for you little pet. But her stuffs pricey, a lease from here collection, $19.99, boy that's steep! \n\nThe store is clean, neatly kept, well organized and they have grooming services. The employees were friendly and helpful, they looked like they enjoyed their jobs, and I would make this a regular place."
"Stayed over on a Saturday night to check out the rooms of the newest hotel in town.  The check-in process was easy, although the clerk remained silent through the entire process.  Normally, I prefer a communicative clerk that confirms the type and location of room I am getting.  In this case, I had to ask her if the room was a smoking room with 2 doubles as I had requested when I booked it online.  It wasn't and she wasn't aware of my request, so she had to start over.  \n\nThe room itself was large and airy and nicely decorated in a contemporary style with a warm color scheme of golds, browns and rust. Slightly larger bathtub than most hotels in town with an out-curving shower curtain rod which gives you a little more room when standing in the tub.  Large desk with 2 chairs and floor-to-ceiling windows with blackout curtains.  A large comfy chair next to the bed is perfect for relaxing and watching the large flat-screen TV.  Only 1 waste basket in the entire room, which I thought was a little odd.  No fridge, but I believe you can request one for an extra charge.  Beds were high and fluffy and very comfy with lots of pillows (love that)!\n\nThe only meal we ate here was breakfast in the morning at their coffee shop, Snaps.  Service was rather slow, as it took about 1/2 hour for our meals to arrive, but our ham and eggs with biscuit and gravy was scrumptuous and filling and very reasonably priced at $4.99!!!\n\nI would not hesitate to book a room here again and I highly recommend it to locals and tourists alike."
Great pizza.  Nice owners!
"I have waited to give this place a second visit before writing a review, because the first visit (Jan 09) was so stellar that it was almost too good to be true. The second visit was a little more than a solid 3 star (especially when considering the price), so I think I'll be generous with the average and maybe give this place one more shot before moving on to other high-end dining in Las Vegas. \n\nIn fact, I was just in NYC last month, but I didn't even bother to call Rao's as I knew it was futile.....I was geared up for my trip to Las Vegas in the coming weeks.\n\nAs mentioned, the first visit was phenomenal. The service was almost too attentive, our waiter told us about the history of Rao's (I grew up in CT, kinda of knew, but not really), gave us an excellent rundown of the menu and allowed us to be unpretentious with our wine choices. Two of us were sat in a booth in a busy, but sociable room off to the left side. \n\nWe went for the full-bellied Italian order of the Mozzarella in Carrozza, arugula salad, veal parm (on the bone!), with the tomato and ham vodka cream pasta. Oh, and don't forget the meatballs and gravy..... \n\nAlthough we were in a food coma (need to upload picture to prove it), we enjoyed the meal and wine thoroughly (and dreamt about the meatballs for months). We couldn't wait to come again. \n\nOur next visit was in July 09. We had a Caesar's concierge make our reservations and dined at a more reasonable hour before 9pm. Although the house was packed, we had a very competent, but indifferent waiter who may have spent too many years in the business to add anything special to the experience. With no other guidance other than \""whataya want?\"", we fumbled our way without an app (no recommendation, no order), warm white wine (I had face my trashy side and put ice cubes in the wine) an uninspiring salad, and somehow, the \""parm and balls\"" just didn't hit the same high notes. After moving to red, we didn't even finish the bottle. \n\nMaybe it was the summer season, the heat taking it's toll, the down economy on Vegas, or something hidden, but the place didn't have the twinkle of that first visit. \n\nOh Rao's, if you want America to buy those sauces and pastas now found from Kroger to Shop Rite, you better give people a memorable experience in your carnival sized restaurant. \n\nAlas, I'll give it one more try, if I'm not broke off playing craps by the time dinner rolls around that evening...."
"I came to the Phoenix location for lunch through Groupon.  I ordered the beef brisket called Ropa Vieja, which was very tough and like eating strands of rope.  I could see where it got it's name \""ropa\"", because it is like cooked strands of rope. There was plenty of meat, but the flavor was all boiled and leached out of the meat.  It was served to me like a stew , but the beans and rice side and the ropa was swimming in a plateful of water almost to the edge of the plate.  The ropa stew had no flavor, like it was boiled in a big potful of plain water that kept getting changed.  I had to add a lot of salt., shake more and more and more salt on it.   It was very ICK to me.   I wish I ordered the cerviche instead.  I didn't think the ropa was worth it even with the Groupon discount, I would not want that dish even if it were free, unless I was starving.  I told the waitress it was very bland and asked her if it was normal to have all that water in the plate.   She said it was \""juicey\"", but to me, juice implies flavor, but I guess \""juice\"" for water is a waitress being positive and politically correct on her job.   My jaws were tired trying to chew the strands of \""rope\"".  She did not offer to bring me something else.  She said that was the way it was.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the coconut mini flan with mango sauce, and that was really good!   I'd give it an A and the size was larger than the word mini implies.  \n\nSorry for such  negative review about the ropa, but I tell it like it is, and if I thought it was terrific, I'd surely say so.\n\nMaybe you will find something else on the menu to your liking, or maybe you are less discriminating than I am about tough and flavorless Ropa meat swimming in a plateful of water  (Yes, I know the difference between juice, sauce, soup, and water.).   I consider myself a great cook and I eat out a lot.  \n\nI only tried this Ropa, and it is not good enough to make me wanna give this restaurant another change at my own cost.   The waitress was very nice and attentive though, I have no complaints about her service, but she did not offer me a substitute.  I would have given it a one star, but she was a friendly and attentive waitress."
"At first glance this looked like a wonderful restaurant to have a great evening meal. We were greeted by a wonderful hostess, and then it went down hill once we sat down at our table. The waitress unfortunately started on the wrong foot when asked about if they had a Malbec in house, the reply was: Yes, It's $200 and I don't think you can't afford that, and we don't sell it by the glass.  I was stunned!  (My husband had returned to the table) to see me, and the others in a shocked state. I would like  to take the higher road and say that I don't believe she realized what she had said to me.\n\nSo in short we settle for the over priced $98 bottle of Ruffino Chianti Classico. The water was great but it lacked the lemon we asked the waitress to bring and received none until we asked the server to bring us some. (With a smile still). \n\nThe menu's came and my husband who never complains about anything was taken back by the prices. Thus adding insult to an already injured evening we ordered our perspective appetizers, and meals and carried on conversations to pass the time.\n\nFrom the ordering of an over priced bottle of wine, ($98) to a menu of food that was good but not off the charts, we could have gotten the same quality and better serve elsewhere. My friend order the Risotto the price was $30.   Risotto!!! Not only was this one the most expensive restaurants, for the quality of food but the service unfortunately didn't add up.  Speaking of service: This evening was so slow that they had a table with a party of 7 who ordered their drinks and their meals up and leave.\n\nAnyway the highlight of the evening:  We found out that if you are a Las Vegas resident you could get 50% off your meals (Alcohol not included of course). Oh! but the waitress forgot to tell my son that...who is a new resident and had left early because of the time. Thank goodness for great friends we met their for dinner. They told us! So that whopping over $400 and then some bill was reduced by the great friends.  So all in all the evening blessing was we got to spend it with our son and our friends who met us their for dinner. No we didn't get dessert!\n\nBeing thankful for good and bad experiences teaches us much about life."
"THE place to be after drinking and walking all over the strip!  Tucked away next to the casino floor and the Venetian sports book, this was not an obvious choice unless you were already in the Venetian.\n\nMy wife and I shared the chicken lo mein which was quite delicious, but strangely included red and green peppers.  I was on cloud 9 once I added the garlic pepper paste to crank it up to 10.  We added in the bbq roast pork which was dry, but the sauce made up for it.  We also had the obligatory \""crab\"" rangoon, which was suprisingly good.  So often rangoon can be stale and chewy...not so at Noodle Asia.\n\nBased solely on food I would give this place 3 stars, but since it satisfied an incredible craving for me, I bumped it up a notch!"
"Tacos, fajitas, burritos and more.  A good spot to grab some of these food items, but it was ultimately overpriced and not the best juicy tacos or fajitas that I ever had.\n\nService was spot on and they have spacious dining area.\n\nMeh."
The veal tartar was off the hook and the service was really good.  Great wine selection as well.  If you find yourself in Montreal this will be a wonderful treat.
"Back in Feb I came to Las Vegas for a weekend getaway with the then bf (now ex). He was being deployed to Iraq and was doing a 3 month training in Cali. So we met in San Diego and drove to Vegas together. I had made reservations for us to stay at the Bellagio and as a surprise to my very Alpha Male ex, made reservations for a couples massage in the Bellagio Spa. \n\nUpon arrival we were greeted and lead to our separate changing areas. We were told to take advantage of the spa areas (separate for male and female) and then we could meet in the general area and we'd be called when they were ready for us to come into the massage area. Along the way we were also given a tour of the other facilities that were available for our use. Including the meditation room. \n\nSide Note: If you come to The Bellagio Spa, TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE MEDITATION ROOM!!!!! OMG.... When I grow up to be rich and successful, I want to mimic the Bellagio Spa Meditation Room in my house. Imagine a dimly lit room with little waterfalls and reflection pools... The calming sound of running water and a little added sountrack of nature sounds... Breathing in and out, deeply and in rhythm with the sound of water... Ahh.... \n\n*snaps back into reality*\n\nOk... So we're called and greeted by our masseuse and lead back to our room. The room is a typical spa room that was set up with two massage tables. We are given our choice of massage oils and then we settled on our individual tables. The massage was going wonderfully and there is a part where they do a hot stone massage. The masseuse places hot stones between each finger and each toe and several along your back. \n\nSo it's peaceful and relaxing and then all of a sudden you hear a loud snore and the sound of rocks dropping to the floor... \n\nYes... My ex fell asleep and jerked wildly as he always does when sleeping and all of his rocks fell to the floor.... At this point I burst into uncontrollable laughter which made my masseuse start to laugh as well... I couldn't catch my breath for about 5 min.... \n\nBut yeah... The massage was great. But I'll have to agree with Tony L on this. I'm knocking off 1 star for price. It's a great place, but for that price, it ain't all that great...."
"It had been about three or four years since I last visited Jay's Gyros and thought I'd check it out again, hoping to find a meal which wasn't as forgettable as my last. It was. \n\nThe people here have no sense of customer service. While it's a quick serve restaurant and I didn't plan on five star service, a mere \""hello\"", \""thank you\"" or a simple smile would have been nice. The person taking my order didn't know the correct pronunciation of the word \""gyro\"".  Once my order was ready, it was placed on the counter and I only knew that because I barely heard a whisper of the announcement.  She couldn't speak up?!?\n\nThe facility is old and the furnishings dated. In fact, I think one of the interior pics posted here may also be outdated, as I don't recall the blue booth-style seats shown. Little effort has been made to spruce up the interior; not so much as blue paint on the walls which is common for Greek restaurants. There was one large screen TV with soccer on, but don't plan on catching a game here. The glare from the lights above would tick off any serious fan. \n\nI ordered the chicken gyro (about $6) and Greek fries (about $2.50.) Both were made to order and served hot. They fries were OK, but the paper bowl they were served in had been soaked through with lemon juice, making for a messy dish. The pita was fine, but nothing to write home about. The fixin's (romaine, tomato and onion) were crisp, cool and plentiful, but I didn't care for the rectangular strips of chicken at all. They didn't look, smell, have the texture of or even taste like chicken. They seemed just like frozen, processed pieces of mystery meat they got from some mass distributor of restaurant food. \n\nOne other thing I don't understand is their odd hours. Greek restaurants don't often serve breakfast and have to rely on their lunch and dinner business. Jay's closes at 4:00pm, so it's either lunch or the special-less early bird special. Guess I'll have to use the Del Taco drive-thru next door. I think their mystery meat is available 24/7."
"My husband and I have been to this Black Angus about half a dozen times in the past year. The service is always excellent but the food has been hit or miss. It was a Friday night and he was craving a burger, but not the normal fast food burger, I wasn't. So we decided on Black Angus, close to the house and they have a kids menu.  \n\nIt was about 6 and the restaurant was not busy, no wait..on a Friday..made us think here we go again..The hostess sat us quickly and the server said he would be right back, waited about 5 minutes and he came back to take our drink order. When he brings our drinks we order our entrees' the Steakhouse Burger, fries & garden salad for the hubs, 6 oz filet, loaded baked & garden salad for me, the child decided he wanted mac & cheese. Salads arrived quickly with the complimentary loaf of bread.  Salads were nothing to write home about but the bread was hot and fresh baked. Entrees' arrived shortly after. Husbands burger looked awesome and he said it tasted great. The fries were the average frozen type. My steak was cooked to perfection, hot and pink on the inside with the right amount of seasoning. The potato was picture perfect but could have used a tad more butter, the meal as a whole will get no complaints from me. The child's mac & cheese was classic Kraft's, he ate it eagerly waiting to get that sundae that comes with each kid's meal. \n\nThe service was outstanding, we never had dirty dishes nor did our  beverages run dry. Our waiter was polite and made conversation. The food was above average. \n\nIf Black Angus could nail it every time like they did on the last visit it would be a favorite on our list."
"Their emu oil is great.  I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, it's wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.  No dyes, fully refined, I love it."
"I only stopped into Carnevino for a late night snack but I enjoyed it very much. \n\nI had the carne crudo, which is the chopped to order steak tartare with mushrooms and the heirloom tomato and burrata cheese caprese.  Both were fantastic.  One of the best tartare I've ever had, and who doesn't love burrata?  \n\nI also loved the housemade foccacia with lardo instead of butter to spread.  It was intensely flavorful, but not too heavy, and a very nice change from regular butter.  A unique and creative offering.  Definite plus points there.  \n\nService was wonderful, friendly quick and helpful.   I've no complaints!  Would defnintely be back."
This Jack's has been closed!  Thank goodness since we got food poisoning from this place!  YUCK!
"One of the most unprofessional companies to deal with. The HOA due was cashed, yet they mailed my mother in law a missed payment letter. Now she has to provide proof that they cashed the check."
"Had a cat emergency, told by local vet to go straight there this morning. Arrived 10 mins to 8am, vet had already left and was told they were closing. Their hours are posted as closing at 8. Receptionist called vet to see if she would come back and would not. What kind of emergency clinic is this??? I'm new to area too so it's not like I know where to go. Had to go across town to another clinic."
"My husband and I, along with another couple, visited the Golden Phoenix a few weeks ago; we shared the Mandarin Dinner.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere was awesome.  Food - not so good.  One thing we noticed - just about every item of food was fried!  Certain items are expected to be fried, such as the chicken wings & the egg rolls on the Pu Pu platter (btw - very bland!).  But the Beef on skewers?  Fried to the point of toughness that I couldn't even chew it.  Worst of all, they do not put knives out as part of the place setting, so you cannot even cut the tough meat they expect you to eat.  The one saving grace to the entire meal was the Mu Shu Pork, which was very tasty with the condiment of dark, rich plum sauce.  The entire dinner was quite plentiful, and we had a lot of food left over, but no one wanted to take it home.  Sad, as this restaurant has been around for 35 years; we probably will not be back.  Two stars for the great atmosphere & service."
"Bad, bad and more bad. Dirty,  unkept. A/C broke it i was 87 in my apt at 10 o' clock at night, took them weeks to handle the situation. They could seem to care less. I fixed things there  ( cabinets,  frige, sink ) and they still didnt return my dep. apt was left spotless and shampooed. They lost packages from the mail. There are roaches everywhere, who knows what other bugs. All in all just bad! I want to leave 0 stars!!!"
"I really wanted to like this place, but going to a brewery and they hand you a menu and tell you they only have 3 beers available?! FAIL! Especially when they are out of their seasonal Oktoberfest beer-and its Oktober...you're a brewery, you know the demand for somehting like this. \n\nAnyway, service was mediocre, we moved to a larger table when some family arrived, I had to ask 4 times to include 2 beer stiens into the bill. The bill arives (finally) no stiens were listed. I asked our waitress AGAIN...it took her forever to come back, I figured she was hand blowing them in the back. I contemplating walking over to the bar and helping myself but I refraiend. \n\nAll in all, if I'm ever in town again I most likely wont come here. It was a total let down.\n*sad face*"
"This is for the location inside of the Mirage. I havent been on Yelp in a few to write reviews, so this review is from mid-Sept. The main reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of the service or lack of decent service inside the Mirage. \n\nAs always, CPK is good and I havent had a bad pizza yet. On this visit, I had the Jerk Pizza without onions and peppers, and it was great. Price was a little high, but again it was in the Mirage. Everyone else was satisfied with the food.\n\nThe server ended up getting on pizza wrong brought out a pasta dish. It took about 10 minutes for the pizza to come back out when everyone was close to half way done. There was no half off or other comp for the mistake. The other issue was is that I paid for everyones pizza with my CC, and noticed it seemed high but didnt think anything of it. When checking the final bill which was lower, the server actually added the pasta dish and charged me but had it removed."
I am so happy to see Ben in his new office.  He is so knowledgable and can read the body like no other chiropractor I've been to.  He's amazing! My husband and I highly recommend Ben!
"The greatest dining experience I've ever had was at Hank's.  The beef is prime grade and the chefs there know what to do with it!  I've been there a few times, so I know it's not a fluke.\n\nI don't have much time to sing all of Hank's praises, but I can tell you that the ambiance is modern and swanky.  The heirloom tomato salad drew rave reviews from my buddies.  My filet mignon and lobster tail was outstandingly prepared.  My brother's porterhouse for two (and yes, the kid took out the 40oz beast by himself!) was equally outstanding.\n\nYou've seen all the other reviews.  There are only two things left to do...1) save up your money, cuz the bill won't be for the faint of heart...and 2) GO HUNGRY!!!"
We went to Claim Jumper after an IMAX movie with another couple just for dessert.  They got us right in.  I have a nut allergy and could not eat any of the desserts because they contained nuts.  The only thing I could eat was a sunday and it was nasty.  Oh and not impressed with the coffee.
"First time visiting Brio. I had the lamb chops, served with mashed potatoes and asparagus.\nIt was great! The lamb was cooked the way I liked it and seasoned well.\nThe Merlot I had was good also!\n\nI don't have a lengthy review to write about Brio, but it is a restaurant that I would try again!"
"Over the years I have past this place 1000's of times.  I finally had the opportunity to eat there yesterday and it was a big disappointment.\n\nWe arrived a little early and decided to have a Beer and much on some Chips & Salsa while waiting for a friend to arrive.  We also ordered a side of Guacamole to go with it.  The Chips & Salsa were ok and the Guacamole was ok.  The Chips didn't taste fresh and there was a bunch of mashed up small pieces at the bottom of the basket, which normally means we got an older batch and had the last basket before they prepared fresh chips.....Strike 1.\n\nWhen my friend finally arrived, it took forever for the server to come by and take our order.  At first we didn't realize how long it was because we had a couple of Beers to hold us over, but after a while we began to notice that it was taking a long time.  I had to flag her down after waiting for 15 minutes.....Strike 2.\n\nI ordered the Beef Fajitas & 1 of their Jalapeno & Cheese Tamales.  They are known for their Tamales, so I was excited to have an opportunity to try one.  The food came out pretty fast, but they didn't bring my Tamale and they didn't bring a friend's entree.  We waited for the food....they brought out my friend's entree, but forgot my Tamale.  I was too busy eating my Fajitas and didn't notice until I was 1/2 way through my food....I mentioned it to the waitress and she said she'd be right back with it.  Meanwhile, the Beef Fajitas were ok.....the flavor wasn't as robust as I would like them to be.....and the meat wasn't up to par.  It wasn't good quality steak in my opinion.\n\nEveryone finished their food and the conversation was so good that I forgot about my Tamale until my friend brought it to my attention.....damn, by that point I didn't even want it.  So I mentioned it to the waitress.....she apologized, but it didn't seem sincere.\n\nWe had a couple more Beers after lunch and when they brought the check, I saw the freakin' Tamale on the bill!  What the hell?!  Strike 3!\n\nAt that point, I didn't care anymore and since the Tamale was only $3 I paid the damn bill and we left.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with the service and the food quality.\n\nWill I return?  Not a chance."
"I was there this weekend, both Saturday and Sunday for a Youth Tournament for my son. Our \""home bowling alley\"" is the Brunswick Zone on Southern and Dobson. This was my first time to this particular alley. This was the worst bowling alley I have ever been to in my entire 31 years of living. \n\nThe location is hidden back behind some office buildings. The building is plain, late 60's decor. The interior, from what I was told, had not been updated in over a decade at least. The newest renovation was a strip of fluorescent carpeting and some fluorescent paint on the walls. (for neon bowling I presume) \n\nThere is no real seating for the bowlers. There are tables and chairs randomly placed through out the building. Each table only gets 4 chairs, so if someone else steals a chair or you have more than 4 bowlers, someone is going to have to stand.  On a rack, in the corner, in the back, there are about 20 alley owned balls, so good luck getting one in the right weight. The bathrooms are tiny and dilapidated.  Whole chunks missing out of several spots in the tile. The handicapped stall has a baby changing station that does not fold up. It stays wide open, so you can't even get in there. The flusher in that stall also gushes when you flush, so you might want to flush with your foot. \n\nThere are only about 20 lanes, and they are occupied by what seems like permanent residents, over the age of 80. They didn't even want to leave for the alley-sponsored tournament. \n\nThe food was just thrown together. Nachos were a plate full of chips, and a tiny cup of cheese sauce. 2 small sodas ran me over $6. The overpriced snack bar didn't even accept credit/atm cards because their phone line was down. \n\nThe lanes were so slick and greasy, they practically had puddles of oil in them. Lane 4 occasionally goes completely dark while people are bowling. \n\nThey do NOT have a pro shop. Their arcade games were few, and broken. I don't think they serve alcohol.I did not see a bar.\n\nI would never, ever come to this bowling alley again by choice. Even the AMF on Main that closed last year was better than this one. They should have closed this one instead. If you're looking for a place to bowl, I would suggest you go anywhere but here."
"They dropped off menus at my company and I thought it looked yummy.  Got a group together and ordered for delivery.  Over an hour later, food had not arrived.  I called and checked to confirm that they had actually placed our order.  The man confirmed that our order was on it's way and there is construction in the area that may have slowed the driver down.  He said he would contact his driver and then call me back with at ETA.  15 min later, still no food and still no call back with an ETA.  Having coworkers raz me about starving, I called and canceled the order.  During they phone call they were not apologetic and said \""Well I couldn't call you back with an ETA because I can't find my driver.\""  Awful service.  I can't even review the food because it never came."
"Staying here for the first time for a business trip.  The hotel is classic outside, modern inside.  The bilingual staff is FABULOUS.  Very helpful and even tried to arrange hockey tickets for me (a bit too expensive, but I appreciate the effort).\n\nThe room is very comfortable and has a nice view.  The bed is super clean and comfy.  The continental breakfast is nice, but they ran out of coffee and I had to wait.\n\nI'm very impressed with the Hotel St. Paul and would like to stay here again."
"SHC Crossfit is Fantastic... It has changed my life, seriously, I love it.  I started crossfit at another box that was twice the cost of this box.  SHC Crossfit is not only less expensive it also has far better coaching than my 1st box!  Come check out SHC Crossfit... you won't be disappointed."
"I have been here a few times now, and just not been impressed. The stylists are OK, nothing great. There prices are decent, but I think a little on the high side for the quality you get. My biggest complaint comes from the customer service. I have called after hours or on Sundays when they are closed several times and left a message. They will NOT call you back. If you are going to have an answering machine then use it and call people back. I guess business is good if they can afford to not return calls and go else where. I will not be returning here."
"Took my family (8 & 10 year olds) to the exhibit today.  Bought tickets for $22 each via the 1/2 price ticket booth in front of Planet Hollywood.\n\nOur kids are really into the Titanic story due to the movie and cable documentaries, so we took a shot.  \n\nThe exhibit was a good experience overall.  The sights, sounds and even the temperatures made you feel as if you were touring through the ship itself.  The many personal effects of the passengers brought the real story to life.  \n\nThe grand staircase was quite a site and we bought a family photo of it for $20.  (We very rarely do this but liked the shot.  They allegedly email you a digital copy as well.  Amazingly the lady said it takes 3-5 days.  Quite odd for 2014 email.)\n\nThe stop , which took about an hour, was a nice family activity in a city not really known for them.  $88 was a tad steep, but not terrible either.  I'm rating it 4 stars because I feel the exhibit could have had more to see. What was there was interesting but I wish there had been more of it.  \n\nOverall pleased with the exhibit!"
"My husband and I were excited to see Ka because I had heard it was the only one of the Cirque shows with a story line.  We also got front row seats, which we were very excited about.  We became very disappointed about both as the show went on.\n\nThere is so much things flying over the audience's heads, blocked views and bad angles from being so close, the most expensive seats are easily the worst in the house.  =(\n\nThe story was ok.  But hard to follow considering they spoke no English when they talked.  When they did talk it was a jumble of Japanese, Italian, Swahili, and gibberish, depending on the origin of the actor.  Pick one and stick to it please, I may not understand you, but I know what each sound like.  I also didn't understand why the floors turned into walls and started rotating at some points.  It just didn't make sense.\n\nBoth my husband and I thought the tricks where bland and basic circus acts.  My husband had a hard time following the story because their was no talking and because of his lack of interest after seeing people dressed up as giant insects and animals.  This show is geared to much younger audiences.  My husband mentally checked out after he saw someone in a puppeteered turtle costume do the moon walk.\n\nThis show is great for small children and if you sit further back.  If you are taking a vacation without the kiddies, skip this show.  The only way I would have found this entertaining would be if I was 5 years old."
"Ugh, this food is horrible. How can so many people like this place?!?!?! Went to dim sum here on a saturday morning and it was very empty. There were only about 3 carts going around and only went around ONCE.  I had to ask someone to come over and help us, but they only ended up bringing a specific plate over than the carts again. Oily stomach lining, slippery wontons....I feel like vomiting just writing about it."
"I have been to this buffet once a few years ago when I first moved to Vegas. I wasnt that impressed with their food. Considering its not hard to like Asian food. I havent been back since then. Today, my wife and I were so hungry, wanted something quick and didnt have to wait for the food. I wanted to give this place another shot considering theyre still in business. They must have gotten better. WRONG! Not only was their food disappointing, it was worse than I remember & the \""other\"" room in the back right corner had this awful musty smell. It was like a combination of a porta potty & a senior home living. The whole experience was just horrible. I barely ate. Couldnt stand being in the place that long. If you have any thoughts of going here, dont even bother. There are better local buffets that will cost you the same but way better."
"Buffets are hardly ever completely different from eachother in price, selection, and people. However, the Bellagio has upped the standard in which these establishments are measured and it mirrors the hotel in how they present their food, service the guests, and the beautiful decor of the restaurant. There is an amazing selection that varies from the finest seafood, to a mountain of Italian pastas, and a great variety of Asian food. While it is a bit steep for a buffet ($30 per person), consider it a fine dining night in which you serve yourself."
"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites across the board due to the consistency of the food and service. Tonight I ordered the fried cheese starter platter, soup du jour (tortilla), and the Chicken and Biscuit entree. Let me start off but saying the fried cheese was excellent, about 8 little triangles perfectly breaded and crisped with Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses and melted to perfection. They were the perfect temperature. The soup was so-so, a basic bisque like consistency with corn and some other veggies. It had a nice spicy finish but at first bite the saltiness is a little  overwhelming. The entree is one of my favorite a good solid buttermilk biscuit, very flaky and buttery, with a vegetable melange (carrots were slightly undercooked) , mushrooms, and peas. The chicken however was moist and juicy, pan seared to perfection. It also had just the right amount of rosemary crust. And the gravy that they use is fantastic, not to rich or thick, and not overly seasoned. That's what I like about this entree it's not overly done so you can really enjoy each component. And our server, Nick, totally professional and nice and a real babe. Over all a great experience and will definitely be back!"
"I was super excited to try a new place. My family told me about this place and thinking that it was new to all of us, I agreed. I was a little cautious because of their reviews. We went during lunch time on a weekday and the place was pretty empty. The waitress quickly seated us. She was very prompt with taking out orders. I can't exactly remember the dish I had, but it came with a little bit of everything. I will be the first to say that I am a very picky eater and I cleared my plate. I was very impressed with my meal. I would def. go back and try another meal for sure. Pricing was decent too! Not too expensive for the amount of food you get. Plus when my brother asked, they gave us extra fortune cookies! This place gets an A from me!"
"Rosie's is mine and my sister's go to beer place. It is conveniently close and just very cozy. I always get the Magner's Cider which is so damn delicious, and Wenesday's live performer is always so delightful to listen to."
"Wait, wait, it's only $3 for a carwash?  And it's the cool kind where you get to sit in your car as it's going through the wash?? \n\nMy mom and I took the cars here to get them washed on sunny day and I couldn't believe how cheap it was.  The location itself is easy to get in and out of, but if you don't know it's there, it's possible to drive right by it.  For $3, the car gets a nice wash and at the end, there are stations to park with non-quarter operated vacuums to clean the inside.  \n\nYou can upgrade to a more premium wash where they will vacuum and wipe down the interior of the car, but my mom is kind of psycho when it comes to cleaning and likes to do it herself."
"My favorite aspect of the Cheesecake Factory is its dependability and consistency.  The menu is large and incredibly diverse, yet everything I have there is always good to great.  We're not talking gourmet excellence by any stretch, but for the price point I always enjoy myself there.\n\nI'm also a huge fan of their curbside to go system, where you call in your order and they deliver it to your car.  Very convenient and I believe it was the first restaurant to provide the service (at least it was the first that I noticed).\n\nOh yeah, and the cheesecakes are pretty damn good, too.  You have to love the variety offered."
"There is nothing i liked about this place at all, I came here because it was close by and had good reviews, however I am not sure why it does. I shared  four sushi rolls with my sister and only sort of liked one of them. One had so much mayo on it I felt like I was just putting a spoonful of mayo in my mouth (I think it was called the super spicy roll.) It is also a very tiny place. Tables are so close together it makes it uncomfortable to talk to the person you are dining with... also it took a very long time to get our food soooo yeah I would not go back!"
"I've been here twice first time we had poor service with dry cupcakes, second time we had the same with a different cupcake girl and I told myself never again! Today at a get together these were brought and once I tasted the dry cupcake and funky icing I knew it was from this place. Yep! I was right. 3rd times the charm for a review. Just nasty-"
"Holy nastiness.... When Im hungover and hungry waiting for a flight, I'm usually not that picky! It's rare that I don't eat food that's in front of me when I'm hungry. This \""breakfast\"" food was so friggin nasty.. I thought for sure, \""can't go wrong with Chili's, let's grab something there\"".. Wrong!!! \nThe \""hash browns\"" were old, stale cut up fries reheated. The bacon was that stringy, thin crap they put on burgers. The toast was barely toasted, thin, and cold. The eggs were even cold. Yuckkkkk... a pre-packaged sandwich from the sports bar would have been better. Anywhere in that airport has to be better- Cinnabon, BK... Whatever you do, avoid this Chili's at all costs. On top of the food being disgusting, they served it with plastic forks and knives... Really??!! I couldn't even get through my rubbery egg with that chinsy fork."
"There is a limited selection of decent Chinese food in my area so I decided to go a little farther away to try Chopstix based on the reviews.  Unfortunately the card reader wasn't working so the man behind the counter asked if I could go get cash.  The nearest ATM is in the Smiths across the way.  I went and got cash (paying an extra $3 since it wasn't my bank) and went back.  There was no one else in the place at the time and the same man behind the counter saw me come in.  I had my cash out and my food was bagged and sitting on the counter but instead of helping me he decided to take a personal phone call on his cell while I stood there and stared at him.  I continued to wait for several minutes and another man was at the counter doing something and also ignoring me.  Finally he looked up and asked if he could help me.  I said I'd like to pay for my food.  At which time the other man finally got off his phone and took my money.  No apology, no offer to give me a discount for my inconvenience, or even just throw in extra fortune cookies or something. \nThe food was decent (wor wonton soup, house fried rice, and orange chicken) but it is definitely not worth going all the way over there for terrible service.  Will not be returning."
"I have to agree with a lot of the posts here, that the customer service is non existent. I was here last Monday. No one welcomes you in, says hello, or can I help you. They do their best to ignore you! I am local, and spent a day in town, as a way to unwind, have some fun, and support the local economy. I did buy a piece here, that I liked, but my experiece was not fullfilling, and their attitude was indifferent, as if they could care less. How do they stay in business? Wow! I went to a similar place at the west end of town, and was treated very nicely, with a smile, and just what I would expect. I will go back there for sure, and skip the dump. I think it is time for the dump to get dumped!"
"Stopped off here a few times when we were over in the area. They are always quick and efficent with moving through any lines. The staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nThey even were kind enough to fix a drink for me when we stopped through after going to a different Starbucks close by that messed up my order in their drive-thru and we were gone before I tried it (too hot to try right away). The cashier was very nice about it.\n\nOverall: A\nGreat staff, quick to move things along and clean."
Rio wasn't what it used to be. \n\nPro: has 3 swimming pools that are kid friendly (meaning that they are shallow)\n\nCons: \n-bed was very uncomfortable\n-water head in the shower was set to conserve water...which is fine but the way it sprayed out it actually made showering longer!\n-elevators were super slow \nAND there's no complimentary WiFi Seriously?! In this day and age you can't offer free wifi?!
"Very friendly service and a great dining experience.   Wr sat outside which was very nice.   The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference.  And a plus,  they serve Coke products.  And there are not too mancy choices in Verado."
"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/battistas-hole-in-the-wall-las-vegas?select=fp3gb-ENJa1b3pi-impq3A\n\nI have a friend who loves this place so much that she is having her wedding reception here. When she found out that we were heading to Las Vegas six weeks ago she insisted we had to check this place out. Attached is a picture of me outside the restaurant. Obviously it was taken before we dined because I am smiling.\n\nFormulaic beyond description! The wait staff have everything down to such a science that there is absolutely no warmth. They bring you free, undrinkable wine and point to the menu on the wall. You order from a handful of traditional and delicious-sounding Italian entrees, ranging in price from about $25.00 to about $50.00.  Immediately after ordering they bring a mealy iceberg salad in a wooden bowl, or soup, and some garlic bread which was fine. \n\nI had the chicken parmesan. It was clearly reconstituted, formed, frozen and reheated. I love Italian food and am fond of saying that I have never met a plate of spaghetti I didn't like. I ate one bite of the chicken and tried the spaghetti and pushed it to the side. My husband really tried to eat his spaghetti too but we just couldn't do it. The sauce is weirdly sweet and off-putting. It was just bad and his too, was pushed to the edge of the table. The wait staff are trained or have learned the hard way not to inquire when diners do this because 1) he didn't ask if there was a problem, when clearly there was. He just briskly removed the offending plates, and 2) all they would do all night is have conversations about their bad food..\n\nThe \""cappuccino\"" included with my dinner was half Carnation Instant Cocoa and half Folger's Crystals. Again, undrinkable and removed without a word when pushed aside.\n\nThe ambiance is great...red and white tablecloths, pictures of Vegas legends all over the walls (behind my husband), and high wooden booths. I know this place was popular back in the day but clearly things here are not as they once were.\n\nI was legit hungry when we left and grabbed a burger at In and Out...it rocked."
"Went for dinner the other night, the place was pretty empty (not usually a good sign).  The place looked pretty nice but the food was very average.  Except for some mandarin oranges we were served which had turned, pretty drastically rancid.  Service was good, I don't know maybe we came on an off night, but I kind of doubt it..."
"Never again! If you're trying to reschedule a hotel pick up, you're wasting your time and your money. Customer service sucks. You would do better to take the public bus system. Not only is it easier and more direct, it's a lot more inexpensive."
"Yum Yum Yum\n\nLove the decor and the music is fun to grooove too lol, The idea of these foods together makes a great diverse meal!\n\nMy deliciious meal:\n-The beef tenderloin and aji panca was great and it was perfectly spicy.. very juicy (not dry at all)\n-Peruvian corn :)\n-The Bobo Brazil samba roll w has seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri -- FREAKIN BOMB"
"Great starter , octopuss with squids grilled\nI ordered the sword fish , kind disappointed \nWas too butter taste like. Wine was good\nToo expensive though , I understand the mark up but this was a bit too much.\nMy wife and I usually stay at the Wynn \nAnd we dine out at bartolotta ristorante Di mare. Very expensive but worth every penny's"
"I dined at this restaurant for the Friday Fish Fry.   The food was fine and reasonable.    My problem was with the staff.   Upon getting ready to leave I asked for a to-go box.    Our table had NO reorders or seconds.   We simply wanted to take with us that which was originally served.   Again, we would not expect to take home leftovers if we had ordered seconds or utilized the ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT menu.   We originally ordered a single serve and an all you can eat plate (not utilized).  \nMgmt. would not oblige us and refused a to-go container.   They were not pleasant to us.     NEVER AGAIN.    Why would they publicly argue with customers ?"
"I tried this place once on a whim as carry out, not sure what the menu name of dish but the description said yogurt chicken also came with fresh naan....ohh my yumminess very spicy and flavorful!  Felt I really scored with this whimsy adventure.  Took me awhile but made it back twice for the lunch buffet and have been very pleased with the selection.  Even though my carry-out and lunch buffet both good experiences I have and will definitely recommend the lunch buffet because if I hadn't gone for buffet wouldn't of discovered they had SO many delicious items available!  The place is clean and blue..lol and the service friendly yet a bit stale.  I do plan on going back again soon:)"
"They now carry a perfectly servicable New Zealand sauvignon blanc, added some mood lighting, have an excellent happy hour menu and have expanded their bruchetta offerings (try the hummus...it's outrageous). Happiness."
"Not worth it. Some weird, offensive smell throughout entire hotel. Gym was packed constantly. Way more kids at resort than I expected.  \nLobby and bar area, pretty. Golf prices, just too high.\nHotel leaves a message at your  room saying \""come down and pick up your free gift\"" but your free gift is really a ploy to get you to buy a timeshare. BRUTAL!"
Well Pie Zanos is no longer at the location on 75th Ave and Bell.   After a short stint here it looks like they packed up everything and moved to 51st Ave and Bell.  The new address on their website is 5060 West Bell Rd.  I hope the change in venue works out for them.
"Lisa gave me a great cut.  I am very fussy about my short hair.  At 60 years old I want a stylish haircut but not to look like I am trying to be 20.  Lisa found the perfect balance, a cute,fun cut, perfect for summer.  I've already scheduled another cut and highlights for later this summer."
"I have frequented Fez quite a few times now, each trip nothing but delicious. I have had the sweet potato fries, and they will beat Delux hands down. The burgers are much better too. My favorite is the blackbean burger with goat cheese. I have also tried the soup and hummus and both were tasty. Drinks are awesome here too. I like the pomegranate presses and the martinis. Also, try this place for a delicious brunch with great drinks. I recommend the egg white omelet with harissa.  Mimosa and bloody mary's are both great ways to start the morning. Can't say enough about how yummy this place is."
I absolutely love this place and desire to eat every meal I can hear because it is so healthy and the juice bar is phenomenal.!.
"Went here for dinner Saturday night. Very nice place. We were greeted at the door, shown to our table. Within seconds we had salsa and chips. our server was great. Brought our drinks quickly. the salsa was a little to hot and spicy for me, the chips were fresh. We ordered bean dip which was very good. I liked the touch of the red onion. It was a small amount and not overwhelming. \nI ordered the charbroiled chicken. BF had the sweet potato enchilada. Both meals were excellent. \nWe will be dining here again. Really enjoyed our meal."
"I usually hate chains, especially Italian ones like Olive Garden and Romanos. But I was pleasantly surprised my Maggianos. We went because we got a gift card for Christmas but we are probably going back. \n\nThe bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good. I wish the dipping oil was just a little more seasoned though. My husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok. My stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed. I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic.\n\nOne nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category. So I ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day."
"A friend and I shared our first meal at BLT Burger, after a 6.5 hour flight that involved leaving the house at 5am.  Thus, a plate of bran flakes would've probably gotten a decent number of stars for the chance to be on the ground in Vegas after the trip.\n\nClearly, BLT Burger provided a better meal than bran flakes. We got one of the 'combo meals' of burger + regular fries + shake, and a side of sweet potato fries and another shake (malibu/ pineapple/ something for her, espresso/ kahlua for me).  This was plenty of food for two people, and saved a bit of money that we could later spend on the slots.  The sweet potato fries were much better than the regular, and the burger was properly juicy with a nice, soft bun.  Nothing super special, but still good.\n\nThe shakes were the highlight.  They were thick, rich, and topped with plenty of whipped cream.  I wish the straw had a slightly larger diameter, but that's a tiny criticism.  There was some vigorous sucking involved in getting all that goodness up the tiny little straw.\n\nService was good, water service was reasonable, price was what you'd expect from Vegas, and shakes get the place to about a 3.5, and I'll round up for the happiness that I had from getting off that plane and into a nice, comfy booth."
Had a good experience here great food and they have kool aid so I thought it was great.... They give you a ton of food for a great price and the BBQ sauce is rea;;y good also. The only down side is they only have outside seating and with heat it is blazing hot in las Vegas and it takes a little long to get the food but other than that it's a great place for BBQ.
"I really hope Native Newyorkers CORPORATE is paying attention to these reviews. Most people here are complaining about the same things over and over and with my recent visit I can assure you none of those problems have been fixed.\n\nHere's my experience from my recent visit on the Mayweather's fight past week.\n\n- When we walked in, after telling the host how many, he just handed the menu to us and told us to sit wherever instead of walking us to a table. This is the worst you can do to a customer. Hand them a menu and tell them to go sit down. Are you too lazy to walk them to a table?\n\n- Place was disgusting. Beer all over the floor and sticky seats and tables. \n\n- Like most people complained here, this facility seems like a depressing hotel from the 90's. No ambience, not hip at all. Also has a weird smell.\n\n- WINGS = EXTRA SMALL compare to any other NN location. \n\n- Rude waiters, specially the guys that work here. No smile, Not friendly. \n\n- Our chicken strips came out burnt. Returned the order. No manager came out to talk to us. \n\nAll in all this NN has worst service than a moms and pops Pete's fish. Not worth it."
"Quite simply, one of the most amazing, over the top dining experiences. We've dined at so many steak houses - as I have a meat loving hubby and 2 teen boys. So we've had our share of Flemings, Ruth's Chris, etc. but this was one of our first trips to the Scottsdale area. I can't believe this is a chain, as everything about it felt so personal.\n\nStand outs:\n\n- Their signature Cosmo: made with orange vodka, shaken at the table and poured into your glass with dry ice. This drink bubbles! Ooohhh I heart this.\n\n- lobster bisque: shell based stock, giant bowl with tons of chopped lobster. If you want the heavy cream based, this isn't it. It is a delish real deal bowl of heaven.\n\n- shellfish tower: giant shrimp & king crab legs. Believe it or not, I'd say it was very good. But I'd rather have the other unique items.\n\n- sides: Mac and cheese, French fries (enough to serve 10 people) and garlic mash. Kids and hubby declared the Mac and cheese the best ever.\n\n- peppercorn crusted ahi - very very tasty (spicy)\n\n- bone in aged filets: this is the stand out bad boy on the menu. Any sauce you want, but awesome enough to do without. 400degree plates. These are the most flavorful filets I've ever had.\n\n- butter cake. Just bring an insulin shot, and jump off the edge to one of gods creations. Can't even describe it. 1 cake is enough for everyone. It's like a giant, sugared pound cake ring with some fresh fruit. I will NEVER come to AZ without eating one of these.\n\nBasically, I think the chef thought \""what is the most sinful dessert\"". Then found an angel, ripped off their halo, rolled it in sugar and torched it to make it even better. That's all I can assume. Sinful, delish, and one of the best things I ever ate.\n\nAlso - 5 star service, live music.... If I run away from home, I will live here."
"my 2nd time there tonight. Pluses: Our server from the first time remembered us - very nice guy. I like the tasting samplers you can get, the free trivia game and the Tue/Thu specials. BTW, there is NO blue cheese in the extra-charge dressing. The food sounds better than it actually is - not bad, just not great. All in all I guess this is damning with faint praise. I like to look forward to restaurants. Lots of tvs and neon beer signs - I get a nagging premonition that loud sports bars like this will be featured in the Smithsonian some day as an example of our 21st century consumerism ... \noh well, it's close to home and my husband likes it ..."
"Please save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else.  This is by far the WORST Acura dealership I've ever dealt with and they obviously don't care about their customers or getting their customers business. \n\nI walked into the dealership and asked an employee (who it turned out worked in the service department) to direct me to the service department.  I waited at the front desk where he sent me for someone to help me, while I did no less than 5 service department employees (including the one who directed me) stood around in a gaggle even occasionally making direct eye contact with me.  None of them bothered to give me the time of day so I took the initiative and went to the cashier's desk to seek assistance from the women sitting there.  I followed this women outside where she went to seek answers from the other employees.  Afterwards she came back to me and proceeded to chastise and blame me for not being helped.  Her logic was that I didn't receive service because I parked my car in the service department's parking lot and walked inside to get help instead of driving it into the entrance of the service garage.  Seriously?!?!?  There is NO sign that says \""If you need an oil change drive your car into unintuitive location and if you don't we won't bother to help you instead we'll stand around with our hands in our pockets\"".  If that sign existed I would partial agree with her rebuke.\n\nSo let me sum this up:  I parked in the most intuitive place I could find, received instructions from an employee who then systematically ignored me, then when I sought help from a different employee I was ridiculed in front of the rest of the employees who failed to help me in the first place."
This is the best show Ive ever seen.
"Great place in Noda. I recently went to a friend's get together and we eventually ended up here. Large outdoor space with lots of tables. The bartender served the liquor generously and the environment was casual yet young and fun without making me feel like I was the oldest one there, which I probably was. Great place for summer drinks with good company."
"I've been out in California for the last three years, but I lived in Madison back when Bluephies first opened in 1994, and have sampled it pretty regularly over the various chef/menu changes.  The last time I came here for dinner, it was a pleasure. I associated Bluephies with fresh local greens, unique flavors that favored aioli and tapenade over mayo, and especially over-the-top breakfast yumminess.\n\n Alas, whatever's happened to dinner in the last year and a half, is totally depressing.  My fiance, my mother, and my two stepkids and I went the last night (8/11) we were in Madison before flying back here.  I ordered an apple chicken walnut salad sandwich, which used to be a pretty awesome blend of aioli and a locally baked croissant with mixed greens, with an interesting presentation.\n\nWhat I got, was something substandard to the airport food that we had at Denver International Airport, and more expensive to boot.  The chicken salad was totally overwhelmed with mayo, the lettuce flabby, and the croissant one of those commercial flabby affairs.  The kids menu dinner items were horrifying; the cheese quesadilla and pizza were microwaved and pretty darn tiny.  My mother's the most forgiving person when it comes to restaurants, but her salmon wasn't good either.  My fiance's meal was totally over-mayoed as well. \n\nThe waitress staff were good, and one waitress who had been there for 2 1/2 years said that it wasn't what it used to be.  And when we complained about the quality of the food, they took off one plate from the price.  I know times are tough, but even out here people have the sense that if you want people to try to get you to ever come back, you should comp the whole meal, or at least offer a free dinner the next time around.\n\nI've used Yelp a bunch of times to check out restaurants ahead of time, but this meal inspired me to actually start up my own account."
"This buffet is located on Gilbert Road across the street from Mi Amigo's and Carl's Jr.\n\nIt's got a varied enough selection and is yummy for the price.  It's clean, well stocked, child friendly and spacious.  I've never had to wait for a table at peak lunch or dinner time hours.\n\nHubby likes it quite a bit.\n\nEveryone is friendly and the food is almost always fresh, even during off peak eating times.\n\nGetting drinks are a breeze thanks to an attentive wait staff.\n\nIf you're looking for fast, quick, easy eats in a Chinese food category, this one's for you!"
"I went to Zack's Hamburgers for the first time, surprisingly since I am a Charlotte native, for lunch today. I got the Zack's Special which is a double cheeseburger with all the fixin's and their special sauce with a side of fries and a sweet tea. Before taking a bite I had to indulge in the crushed ice that we all dream about in the tea. Man that stuff is good.\n\nThe burger was delicious but not because it was anything fancy. It was more a burger that reminded me of my childhood. It was one of those things that just puts a smile on your face with every bite until the very last. The fries were perfectly salted and simple. No ketchup needed. I did see some chili cheese fries that I may have to try out next time. \n\nService was great and she recommended the Zack's. I had to get a refill of tea and some more crushed ice and they were attentive to me even with a long line. \n\nOverall, great experience. Just remember to get there about 11:30 or after 1 for lunch to prevent waiting in a long line."
"From my walking around, this was the best value margarita station ($13 half yards with $10 refills) on the main strip and the drinks didnt disappoint.  Lots of different flavors to choose from too."
"Herb hummus, Street Tacos, Chopped salad w/chicken, & Tabbouleh Salad all delicious!\n\nIf I had to make s suggestion it would be to spice up the fish in the tacos with a little more flavor, but they were perfectly cooked, flaky and moist.\n\nThe hummus appetizer is a generous portion; enough for 4-6 people."
"QDOBA on Central, Park Central Mall - 9/24/13, Tues @ 11:30 am... I was waiting in line for over 10 mins, when I finally got to the girl, she told we they we out of chicken! I don't eat meat or pork, so I ONLY wanted chicken. I flat out said, \""Good-Bye!\"" to her & walked out,  as I was walking out, I made sure that I told everyone in line that they were out of chicken. I was very upset!  NO restaurant should ever run out of something like chicken! I would think that a restaurant would be or even should be embarrassed to be running out of a 'staple' such as chicken, don't you think? and the girl was so nonchalant about it, too."
"I love the Red Rock Casino, but the kids have ruined this theater.  If you must go, don't look down.  The carpets are gross and really need a change.  Otherwise, they always have a good selection of movies, an IMAX theatre, and they even have a party room if you'd like to throw one there."
"Revo Burrito (yes, it is pronounced REE-vo) is my new obsession. It's another restaurant by Lenny Rosenberg, the inventor of Blue Burrito Grille, and current owner of Father's Office knockoff Delux Burger and mediocre sushi joint Zen 32. Situated on the same corner as its cousins, Revo Burrito stands apart as a delicious, fresh, pile of amazingness. The best way to describe the food is like a Chipotle that is run by gourmet chefs. The beans are delicious, if a bit simple, and have perfect texture. The rice is amazing; it is creamy with corn mixed in. I have had the grilled veggie burrito (squash, peppers, etc.) and the organic black bean burrito, both of which are great. I would recommend the veggie, though, and order it as a platter with rice and beans on the side so you can still get your fill of both. The combo platters also come with so-so chips and fresh salsa -- get the tomatillo. The pricing usually works out to be a bit on the high side for a quick-service joint: A burrito combo and a lemonade will set you back about $12 by the time all is said and done, so it isn't cheap, but it is worth it.\n\nThe burritos are made fresh and the service is very helpful. It is a modified Pei Wei sort of set up where you order at the counter and they bring the food to you. The decor is very trendy and eclectic, although I find it very annoying when a restaurateur spends so much time and effort on the design and architectural detail of the space, then starts printing up signs like \""order here\"" and \""we now serve brown rice\"" on what appears to be a HP inkjet, then tapes them to the registers, counters, etc. There is a reason why sign professionals exist -- use them.\n\nAnd, the best comes last: The lemonade, oh the lemonade. I could do without the gaudy FastSigns that assault you at the entrance, but I can forgive them because the lemonade is so amazing. They serve a traditional, fresh-squeezed, old-fashioned lemonade in addition to mango, strawberry and raspberry flavors. I recommend going for a mix of the two berries... it is heaven. I would drink it all day long if I could.\n\nStop by Rev Burrito one of these nights, and odds are you will see me there enjoying a veggie combo. Seriously, I will be there."
"Low key atmosphere, on Mondays they have $5 burgers when you buy a $3 beer, great deal and great food."
This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas. Their choices are so fun and flavorful. I like their chicken and waffles! The waffle they have with this meal has bacon in it. Everybody knows that waffles and bacon has got to be the most amazing combination ever haha! The waffles were fluffy and moist. Their chicken was fried but not greasy. It was tender on the inside and it goes great with the whole meal. Definitely a sweet & savory meal for sure!\n\nThey don't take reservations during the weekends so there is typically a 10-20 min wait around breakfast time which is not bad at all. It's definitely worth the short wait. The servers get pretty busy so you might not get your drink refill instantaneously. Parking is also a pain sometimes. I suggest one person to get out of the car and put your name on the list while somebody finds parking ;)\n\nOh their watermelon lemonade is pretty good but I don't think it's worth the $5 honestly. It's not refillable and there's more lemonade taste than watermelon so just a heads up.
"Love this place!  Best to check the website before you go so you know what is going on the night you are planning to go.  I came on a random Wednesday with my girlfriends for a dink after my birthday dinner.   We did not know it was a mainly gay bar, so we were some of the only females, but everyone was so nice and we danced and had a great time!  It was VERY full the night we came.  We wanted to go back for \""Dragaoke\"", karaoke in drag we assume- but we have not made it yet.  A fun place to go if you have an open mind about what is fun!"
"Roomy, modern rooms and fun pool and hot tub. Great alternative to smoky old strip hotels. Moderately price."
We were given a room at the courtyard section.  Big mistake I guess the amount you pay for is what you get.  My family and I experieced bug bites for the past two nights. Noticed one bite the first night but on the second night we all noticed more bites on are face and body.  Informed the front desk and this had to be reported to security.  They took along time. Would not stay there again.
"I rarely ever have a good experience at a Best Buy. I was there the other day and I wanted the Fitbit in the light blue color. This is exactly as it is presented on their website. I called the Thunderbird location and they did not have it in stock, which is fine. I called this location, gave them the SKU and everything, and they said they do have it in stock. When I went down there, the sales associate I dealt with treated me like I was the daftest person on the planet and kept insisting that this color did not exist, even though I called and spoke with someone at the store AND saw it on the website. I showed him the website and he walked around the corner and guess where it was. There was no need to be condescending when I knew exactly what I was talking about, and there was no apology. It is degrading to be treated this way by someone who thinks they know everything and has zero customer service or people skills whatsoever on top of it. I spoke to the cashier who asked me if I found everything I needed okay and I said, \""sort of\"" and explained the situation. His reply was \""oh yeah, that's just how he is.\"" That's just how he is? Then fire him; he shouldn't be working in the industry. That shouldn't just be something that is acceptable to them. Ridiculous."
"It's ok. \n\nI would rather get something else but my boyfriend and his friend have a weird obsession of coming here instead of ordering first. It's not really a big deal till the sun goes down. Then the local college crackheads come out to play. \n\nThe area is pretty sketchy in my opinion and having some cracked out guy talk my ear off while the stoned employees take their time on my pizza is not an ideal Friday night... well it could be for some people. \n\nThe music is kinda loud in the establishment so prepare to have to talk louder then normal to get your order semi right. \n\nI had hungry howies deliverd to my place once. I told the delivery driver to keep the change (was like $5 tip) and he said wow in such a way that I thought he was expecting a bigger tip. \n\nAnyways, I like the howie rolls and the cheese, sausage and green pepper pizza. But when in doubt, if its 2am and your stoned and hungry, just have them deliver it to you instead of waiting with the crackheads at the store."
Open 24/7. I just have to say every time we come here the girls that work inside are very nice and if they get a chance they will talk with you. Since they see us at least once a week we talk more. It always is clean inside and they are usually stalked up on drinks and snacks etc. \nOf course we will be back.
"3.5 stars rounded to 4. Biggest gripe is the looooong lines, especially during their Xmas BOGO promo. Had to wait an hour, and barely made the 4pm cutoff to get in on the promo (they had told us if we didn't get to the register before 4pm, it would be full dinner price per person!)\n\nOnce in, the selection was out of control. Everything and anything you can imagine, plus free beer and wine. Quality of food was very good as well.\n\nI'd suggest going to lunch for $12 or so (with the players card) as dinner is a bit pricey. I think they take reservations as long as there's not a promo going on."
"This review is for the Parts Department.\n\nThe RDX is being cranky (pun intended) and is having a hard time starting in this hot weather. Living in Vegas means you have to replace your vehicle battery more often than other places. I called the local usual chain auto parts store to get pricing and then called Acura of Las Vegas. The OEM pricing of the battery is very competitive and fitment is spot-on versus a non-OEM battery. With my discount, it costs much less than a similar Sears or Interstate battery."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in AZ, and a great place to come with friends for great food and beer. The best pasty is the chicken pot pie, it's to die for! And the staff are all friendly and efficient. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are large, so we always have leftovers to take home. Cornish is the best!!"
"I dont even know why anyone likes this place. All their meats taste exactly the same, like nasty rubber salami.\n\nAnd there was a fly in my soup.\n\nEven their commercials fucking suck. Did they really think Spongemonkeys singing the most annoying song in the world would make people want to buy sandwiches...?\n\nI'm all set with Quiznos. Thanks, but no thanks."
I really enjoy gambling at this casino because of the vibe and the younger crowds. But there service and the rooms suck! I get comps here but it never seems like they're willing to make you happy. The rooms are old and dirty. The mall is okay. Nothing special! Go across the street to the cosmo if you want both great service and amazing rooms!
"Chino Bandido is a staple for my sister and I. I'm not going to lie, when describing this place I feel the need to mention that while it's not much to look at on the outside--inside it delivers some of my favorite guilty pleasures.\n\nI encourage anyone who is trying this place for the first time to take a few minutes and allow the staff to guide you thru what they have to offer. With their complimentary taste test , you can try a few of their most popular dishes and learn how to order off of their moderately challenging menu (but once you get it, its super easy). I ALWAYS go for the combination of double jade red chicken, refried beans, and plain fried rice.\n\nThe snickerdoodle at the end is perfectly baked. Every time. Love this place."
"My favorite pizza place in Phoenix, bar none. Amazing, life changing pies. You must eat here. \n\nOther reasons why I like it:\n- cheap, good bottles of wine\n- dog friendly\n- light rail accessible\n- romantic vibe (but not too romantic, totally ok for just casual dining with friends)\n- friendly staff\n- free of Old Town Scottsdale douchery\n- desserts with nutella\n- fresh & often local ingredients\n- no ridiculous wait times like Bianco (usually 30 min or less during peak times)\n\nHighly recommended."
"It was 9am and we were hungry and we wanted a traditional american breakfast, so we walked down the strip hoping to find a decent and affordable breakfast buffet.  Most of them were pretty expensive and by the time we walked all the way to Harrah's we were exhausted and extremely hungry, so we thought we'd give it try.  It turned out to be better than we had expected and more!  They even had freshly made cotton candy and gelato!  Prime rib and cocktail shrimp for breakfast!  I think their breakfast prices changes after 10am and luckily we got there before 10am.  They also have a omelet station.  I've never been here for dinner, but breakfast was awesome!"
"Singh Farms Saturday Mornings is a great spot to get a bite and grab some top notch home grown produce the only day of the week they sell to the public. I suggest getn there early. This is a sweet local hidden gem you may never have known was there hidden under the Palo Verde you barely noticed driving by it on the 101. As you walk around it just keeps going. I'm pretty sure I saw a Turkey there last time...? If you grow food in your garden, you want their top soil. Sing Farms Saturday, hit it!"
"Best brunch in Madison and spectacular Bloody Marys. Lunch and dinner fare is tasty. Love the atmosphere, large number of big screens, and big beer selection."
"This is my favorite sushi in the valley, especially when someone else is paying because it's pretty pricy. The sushi always tastes incredibly fresh and the menu has several creative options. I'm not usually a big fan of yellowtail but a friend insisted I try their yellowtail sashimi appetizer. The fiand was so fresh and delicate and the ponzu sauce was so fantastic that I had to restrain myself from licking the plate. I tried big eye tuna sashimi for the first time here and was blown away. I've since tried it at other places and it didn't come close to the flavor and texture of the dish at sushi roku. We had some standard rolls which were also great but my absolute favorite thing I had was the lobster Roll with soy paper and a misoyaki butter sauce. It was so unbelievably delicious! I've been back several times for that roll alone. The ambience is very cool and is great for a special occasion or business dinner."
"I have a confession to make: The pastries in the Sicilian Pastry Shop frighten me. \n\nEvery time I go past and glimpse at the rows of gigantic cakes, puff pasties, cream buns and iced deserts, I get visions of Tony Soprano and his crew. Some times, they select half a dozen pastries to eat in the strip club with their espressos. Other times, I imagine them pistol-whipping customers that dare to look in their direction as they demand half the shop's takings and the baker's freshest cakes.  \n\nI'm sure they taste good but are they worth the possibility of being iced to death? ;-)"
"DO NOT GET KEYS MADE HERE!\n\nI am so annoyed with this Ace. I moved into a new place and needed to get keys made. The cashier paged someone and after waiting about 15 minutes I headed toward the exit, then he finally arrived. I had 5 keys made, 2 didn't fit.  Went back to have the 2 fixed, 1 still didn't work. Ugh!\n\nFast forward a year later and keep in mind my deteriorating memory, I once again had to get keys made and returned to this location. I got 5 made, 2 didn't work (sound familiar). When I went  back to get the keys fixed the woman who helped me told me it is not usually the fault of the people cutting the keys, but the calibration of the machine. She assured me the machine was just calibrated so we should have no issues. \n\nAnd guess what? One of the keys STILL doesn't fit."
"Been going here for years and never had an issue.  Just had dinner there last night and the service was great from start to finish.  The food came out hot and ready for us.  The Cheese Steak is always a hit as is the Chicken Cheese.  Had the Pizza before and the sauce is of a different spice than most.  It is really good, and not your ordinary tomato sauce.\n\nKeep up the great job!"
"I was so excited to try the dinner buffet at the Wynn.  I've had lunch there before and it was great.  We waited in line for a little over an hour but i figured it would be well worth the wait.  Everyone at the Wynn is super friendly and the customer service is excellent.  However, the food at the buffet was average for the most part and some even below average.  The seafood was good.  Crab legs and shrimp were great.  Had some sea bass that was totally over cooked and dry, there was no fresh fruit, only turkey and roast beef available.  Never been to a buffet without prime rib.  Asian food was completely horrible.  They had dim sum that was soggy and cold.  Money is better spent at another place"
"Chicken cobb pool-side\nSprouts, avocado, so good!\nSix dollar Cokes - bargain?"
"Many have waxed poetic about the splendor of burritos.   Statues have been erected in their honor as a token of appreciation to their flexibility of ingredients, their filling nature, and, of course, their deliciousness.  Wait, there aren't really burrito statues across the world?  We should get on that.  As a result of the existence of this amazing food invention, you trek to your local Chipotle once a week for lunch and gorge yourself silly while pointing and laughing at those across the street at Taco Bell.\n\nWell what if I told you that there existed a place in Las Vegas that went above and beyond what you get when you visit Chipotle, Robertos, or heaven forbid Taco Bell for your burrito needs?  THIS IS THE BEST BURRITO IN LAS VEGAS   Full disclosure:  there are probably 120 other burritos I have yet to try here, but I'm not above hyperbole for my reviews.\n\nYes, the place is way too small and seats are way too closely spaced for their own good.   We sat in the last table for 4 available on a Friday evening and I had to eat my entire meal as if I were in a straitjacket.   I didn't care.   I ordered a Pork Verde Carlito's Burrito smothered with Green Chile and some Jalapenos on top.   You know that cliche from movies and TV shows where people eat something delicious and are constantly going \""Mmmmm\"" and exclaiming how good what they're eating is?   I became that cliche.  The pork was incredibly tender and flavorful, and the flavor of the green chile smothering it will make it hard for me to ever eat another dry burrito again.   This is not a small portion either.  For $7.25 I thought the amount of amazing burrito I received was worth it's weight in gold.   Here's the kicker:  I was still hungry afterwards.   Not hungry in the sense of \""that 3 lbs of pork and chile and tortilla has left my stomach empty\"", but hungry in the \""I want to eat every single thing on this menu right now\""    Everyone at my table seemed happy, though my friend who got the Frito Pie may have exploded before he made it home as none of us have ever heard from him again (kidding)\n\nFor drinks we got some margaritas to start which I found to be very weak.  Very syrupy and not enough tequila for my liking, but for $3.00 I kind of expected that.   Then I braved a Michelada because I'd never had one before and I'll try anything once.   Never again, but I was glad I tried it.   On my third choice I settled for Modelo on draft and like Goldilocks, it was juuuuust right.  \n\nCramped, too crowded, too chaotic, bad margaritas?   Check, check, check, check.   5 stars just for the burrito?   Yup.   Let the first burrito statue we erect in Vegas bear the name of Carlos."
"Just got off phone with service manager, they returned my vehicle to me with a coolant hose disconnected. Service manager said \"" sorry but my tech did nothing wrong, must of been miscommunication between my wife & service advisor\""... Really, this is how your manager handles my survey complaint?"
"**4.5 stars**\n\nI visited Jean Philippe in the Aria hotel for the crepe and desert.  I am sure I would appreciate all the food and dessert here IF i didn't stuff my face prior to visiting this place.  I ordered the Ham Crepe and it was a my first time eating a crepe.  It was a positive experience, but it's something I could do without.  Glad I gave it a shot though.  Maybe I am not a Crepe type of guy.  I'll try a dessert crepe next time.  You can see how the crepes are made in front of you.  It is quite a delicate process.  I also tried the white chocolate cheesecake and that was amazingly good.  The cheesecake has a smooth texture to it and will melt in your mouth.  Eyes will roll all the way back when people eat this.  It was covered with a thin sheet of white chocolate.  Presentation is superb.  I would go back just for the desserts.  \n\nThe restaurant is set up in two sections.  One area is serves gelato and crepes, the other half serves desserts, sandwiches, and coffee / beverages.  The location has a very modern look / design to it and is very appealing.  The glass case showcases all the desserts they have to offer and it just makes you want to order 1 of everything.  I was very tempted to do it too.  I swear every dessert were chanting my name.  The prices are bit higher than what I normally would pay, but hey its Vegas, you win big and spend big.  To give you an idea of the prices, a large cup of soda is $4 (~ 32 OZ).  \n\nCheck this place out for great desserts.  Do not go if you are on a diet because just looking at the desserts will be considered cheating!  This sin is perfect for city.\n\nBon Apettit!"
"Laid back atmosphere, fresh food, very open seating. Delicious food. Plenty of parking."
"Growing up in high school, my friend Julia used to just rave about this place.  She swore the curry puffs were the best thing she'd ever put in her mouth.  She lived all the way across the city, though, so I never had the chance to sample it.  The last time she was in town, I went with her family.  I would have been less than impressed anyway, but it truly paled because I was expecting something spectacular both from her raves and the various awards it's received over the years.\n\nThe curry puffs were OK, but nothing great.  The rest of the dishes seemed like something I could get at any Chinese restaurant without the price tag that Cathay House put on them.  The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but the value wasn't there.  Wish I could have tried it 10 years ago."
"Great show for the kids and adults. Mac King doesn't get the respect he deserves. Maybe he needs to ratchet his show up a notch or two by incorporating some white tigers, pink elephants, or hot models.\n\nThe show is equal parts magic and comedy, and Mac King is adept at both. His improvisational skills are sharp, honed from decades of live performances. If you are a magic aficionado, you have probably seen other people perform Mac's tricks before, but that's true of pretty much every magic act.\n\nCompare the price of Mac's show to the other shows on The Strip and it just further accentuates what a great value the Mac King show is."
"had the best breakfast sandwich ever! good service, nice decor, only complaint is lack of wifi - but it doesn't matter much"
"Lights too low, music too loud, not many people inside, drinks too expensive. Plus it costs 5$ just to get in. Def not worth it. Try some where else!"
"I went to dinner with a friend here last night and it was my first time at this restaurant. The food was awesome. We had the fried egg rolls, pad thai, and yum neua. All were very good.\n\nThe service was wonderful - the server did a great job and was very prompt. The manager even came over to say hello to us and ask how we liked our food.\n\nI will definitely be back. It's not easy to find good Thai in this city and this place is definitely a keeper!"
"The food was just awesome.  The 5 of tried 3 different steaks and 5 different sides and we loved everything.  The steaks were perfectly cooked.  My favorite sides were the jalepeno cream corn and the brussel sprouts....so flavorful.  Also loved the sweet potato tots and asparagus. The waitress was sweet and her service very good.  My hubby and i had 2 huge steaks and 2 sides for under 60 bucks.  The only disappointment was that we had 5:00 reservations,  (as well as several other patrons),  and we all stood in the 105 degree heat for 15 minutes because they didn't open the doors until 5:15 (even though a sign on the front clearly says happy hour is 5:00-8:00.) When they finally opened the door there was no apology from the hostess, and she didn't even hold the door open.  She just opened it then closed it on everyone.  Despite the bad initial impression,  we will go back for the food.  We will just be sure to go after 5:15."
"All of Fox restaurants are legit, and Zinburger is no different. Delish ISH! Love the Breakfast burger w/ a fried egg on it. I get it lettuce wrapped, no mayo to keep it fairly Paleo. Sweet Potato fries are bomb and don't need the aoli they come with if you wanna keep the calories down."
Seems like every time we go to this branch there is 5-10 people in line and only two tellers. (Which is not too bad because lets face it BoA stock has dropped from $54.85 to $16.64 so you might expect a little penny pinching.) However there is no excuse for tellers to be so busy and have one or two supervisors wandering the floor shuffling papers and fooling with computer tablets. This one clown actually went to every person in line and asked why they were there and offered to show them how to use the ATM as if no one ever used an ATM before. Jump in and help the tellers when you see more than 5 people in line how about some team spirit instead of that's not my job.
"Vienna Beef FTW! Any hot dog place that proudly serves Vienna Beef is a hot dog place for me. After a lesson on the history of Vienna Beef from the boyfriend's iPhone, we were in the mood for some good Chicago-style hot dogs and since we were in the area (on the way back from a Cubs/White Sox spring training game), we stopped in. I used to live in this area and had been here several times when it was under a different name and it's still as delicious. It seems to me that they're still using the same good products. \n\nWe both got the \""hot dog and fries basket\"" which was just as it sounds. Good hot dog, served with all the fixin's (or however you request): mustard, onions, relish, tomatoes, cucumber salt, and sport peppers. Nom. \n\nLots of sports memorabilia on the walls- great for looking around while you wait for you food to be cooked fresh to order."
"On Thursday 3/28 I received a flyer from Rosatis at work.  Since we have ordered Rosatis pizza in the past and really liked their product we thought it was nice that they had a location so much closer to us now. \n\nHere's why they get 1 star.\n\nWe ordered an XL thin crust pizza for delivery and were told it would arrive in an hour and the total was $25.  No problem, that's normal for Rosatis, and quality food takes time.  \n\nThe delivery guy arrived on time (right at an hour) and was acting kinda weird.  He seemed nervous and set the pizza on the desk.  We signed for it and said thanks.  He just kinda stood there and looked at all of us (there were three in the room).  I asked if there was anything else?  He said \""no\"" and sort of shuffled out, looking at us the entire time.\n\nWe took the pizza into the other room and opened the box.  Now it made sense.  The pizza had been in a horrible collision as if it had been dropped and was like a ball of pizza in the corner of the box.\n\nI called to reconcile the problem and explained the situation, expecting we'd get a refund or the next pizza free.  The lady at the other end of the phone said this \n\n\""um... sorry.\""  So I said \""ok...\"" To which she replied \""are there any other major complaints?\""  So I asked her to get her manager and have him call me back.\n\nThe manager called back and apologized and said he'd give us $2 off our next pizza.\n\nSo we don't get a free pizza, but if I ever order from that location again I will get a pizza that costs $23.  Thanks for the $2.  I don't think I'll be cashing in on your offer."
Older but comfy.  Great for the you get crowd.be sure to eat at the Taco & Tequila bar!
Nice place for the family to discover the wonders of the sea. An hour is about the time you need to get around the place.
"For being a local hang out,  this place has the coldest draft beer around and the nachos and wings  aren't too shabby either...  Unfortunately this place has the MOST unfriendliest waitresses around. The minute you step in you are greeted by  a long face gal that can just sour the rest of your nite."
I was a little out of my element at this high class restaurant but it was worth the trip.  We went for breakfast and tried the Chicken and Waffles.  The baked chicken and gravy was fantastic.  The service was top notch.
"I like coming in here for a look and see, that's were I just browse the isles and pick up whatever I find I need.  Sometimes I find it and sometimes I don't.  I did have an agenda today, I am looking for a clothes hamper. \n\nThis place has all kinds of things for the bath and home, including a hamper, but not want I was wanting.  With three cats at home, it has to be sturdy enough to withstand their claws!\n\nThis is a great store for home furnishings, prices can be reasonable."
"This place is Horrible.  And I thought this was going to be a great day in paradise.  Course is very challenging.  Target golf, choose wisely golf, easy up and back down golf.   This appears to be fun but its a day of looking for your ball for 85 percent of the golfers.   Give up quick and just drop.  You need a Driver, 7 iron, wedge, putter and a .22 for all the fairway bunny bandits.  The downfall really is in course management.  Dry and ripped up.  And blind shots on an already tough course.  The grass changes the trajectory of all the shots.   There is no room for error until the ball lands on the course.   I do not recommend this course.  It was a beautiful day and the Cart girl came once and that was at the turn.  The Grill shuts down at 3pm.  I was hungry, and so was my party.....thanks but no thanks.  \n\nWe took our 8 person party to Brio across the street for happy hour which was the best thing of the day.  Where we all talked about the courses unhealthy appearance.\n\n4 Members and 4 Guests.   I am a guest.  I would hate to be a member.\n\nShot a 114 all said and done.   And I was happy to leave.   But I will be back to receive a welcome response from this poorly trained Staff."
"I've been to Nora's a couple of times, and I guess it's one of my favorite restaurants that I didn't realize was my favorite restaurant.  This time, we went back because I had a Groupon... $40 worth of food for $20.  I think the menu changed, because it didn't seem familiar to us at all.  Much more tapas-oriented now, which is OK by us.\n\nWe started with the torta fritta, which was fried dough served with meats and cheeses.  Then we had the arancini, which was baked risotto balls with mozzarella cheese.  My girlfriend loved that dish.  Next we had the polpette agro, which are swedish sweet & sour meatballs.  Also delicious.  Lastly, we had the pesto gnocchi.  I was craving gnocchi when I got there, but I was a little disappointed with Nora's take on it.  Just not the texture of gnocchi I was craving.\n\nOverall, I was very happy with our meal.  Total bill was $45 before taking off the Groupon, which means I paid $25 for all of this, plus tip.  Our server Julio was pretty attentive, though a bit difficult to understand.  Wish I had bought more Groupons!"
"Great portions , fresh food , amazing customer service ! Very convenient parking and great area one of my favorite spots"
"I'd heard stories about a place where you could decide everything from the type of base to the toppings and watch your creation being made.  I visited the website and looked over it.  It took a friend with a Groupon to  persuade me to go and I'm glad they did.\nThe place was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.  We got there a bit after 5pm with only a few people ahead of us.  The choices were amazing and I finally decided to try almond milk base, Life is a Chai Way.  They were out of regular caramel but suggested Salted Butter Caramel Sauce or offered to make something else.  Psychic? Or just good timing? I'd been craving salty fries all day long so salted butter caramel sauce it was - YUM!\nWith the temps going over 100 the next few days,  I will definitely be visiting again."
"My favorite pizza in Madison, WI.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA?select=jRGZL2b1hdZcoZszIcBQRw\n\nI could care less if the pizza is pre baked and that the crust is meh. Did you see what was on my pizza?! And yes, that is all it takes to wow me sometimes. \n\nSo glad I got to have that pizza again after a 5 year hiatus."
"Not impressed. The clothing was geared toward women in their 50's or 60's- like the matching outfits and printed pants. The prices, even after the discount, was not much lower than department stores like Dillard's. I tried going back but I didn't find anything."
So first the lady on the phone read my order back completely wrong. I corrected her twice and when I arrived in 30 min to pick them up I had to wait another 10. The order was still in correct and nothing was offered in return. I love NYPD but not this one and I advise to go to another location.
"My husband and I spent a weekend in Las Vegas 2 weeks ago. Before booking with travelocity i went to the stratosphere's website and looked at all the pictures. i was very impressed and excited about our relaxing stay. unfortunately when we got there it was a different story. our room looked worse than something form a motel 6. in fact i have stayed at nicer motels. Our room was old and disgusting, the shower didn't work. and it make the stay very uncomfortable. We go to las vegas every year to get away, we will never stay in this hotel again. we were very unsatisfied."
"So I've only been living in North Scottsdale since November on the *other* side of Scottsdale Rd. for most of my life. Getting fed up with my nails chipping after a few days of being painted I recently decided I would start getting regular manicures so my nails always looked superb. I live at Thompson Peak Pkwy and FLW so I have plenty of nail salons to choose from but on Saturday picked Paulene's Nails because it was on my way to running errands. I got in and was seated right away. For the most part, my experience wasn't half bad until the nail tech asked me if I was pregnant (either for lack of conversation or just to be rude because I have never been asked this in my life) to which I just kind of got a sour experience from there on out. She criticized my choice in color (black on Valentine's Day) and was asking questions about my boyfriend and I that were frankly none of her business. She was chattier than any other tech I've ever had. She ended up slightly injuring one of my nails from filing them down or perhaps cleaning them.   It's just a small cut that has practically healed but not something I should be receiving when I get my nails done.  A simple manicure cost $15 (not terrible) but they wanted $38 for a mani AND a pedi which is WAY too much in my opinion.\n\nNeedless to say I will be looking elsewhere for my manicure next time."
Quick and simple!
"Ok this is the way to get to Vegas, and this is the tourist mecca.  It was glitzy years ago but is now a bit divey and not so easy to get around.  I am not sure how else you would get to Vegas unless you want to brave the drive but the airport will not be the highlight of your trip."
"The worst Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh! The taste is ok, but not worth the price at all, neither the taste nor the amount. I'd rather go to Oriental Express or any other fast food to get a moderate Chinese food with cheaper price.\nI've been here several times with friends, nothing impressive, and the last visit was the least favored. The Lamb Kebab is really, really just a few bite... and it taste like fried, not roast on fire... I would like to pay only half the price, or even less for it...The Xinjiang Style Chicken was not in so large amount as the menu says (serves two), and it is the least authentic Xinjiang Style Chicken I've ever got (and much worse than the one I cooked)\nI never try their Sushi, seems much better than it's Chinese."
"Loving the Pita Jungle! Almost twice a month my friends and I meet there for gossip and wine and mediterranean food.. AND the crowd reminds me a bit of DC... (silly I know!, but I love when guys are in suits at lunch! ).. hehe! ABOUT the food... Greek Salad.. if your watching your mid.. this is what I say works! Large or small .. the large too much for me.. but its a good salad. IF no dates that week! THEN 'splurge' on the Spinach Quesadilla. its on lavosh bread... and not over greasy.. their version of pico de gallo, is fresh and works with the quesadilla.. and the tsaziki is a plus.. all med cafes need an awesome tsaziki, after all its just a given! They have a full bar.. good wines.. Gazpacho rocks! AND Ive had the seared ahi with fruit salad.. YUM! the portions are big.. be prepared... :-) \nNOW If I were here on a lunch hour.. idk..this place has a wait outside and in.. and its placement of tables is on the European scale (like elbow to elbow).. make friends , I guess!"
"This review is only for the bar that's located in the restaurant side. Our bartender, David, was rude, looked bored, and didn't want to be bothered by people looking for drinks and food. He honestly looked like he hated his job (and life). I can deal with shitty food, but shitty service pisses me off. Apparently Gilley's is where washed up bartenders go to die."
"Outside the establishment, taped to the window is a sign: do not leave valuables in car. I took note, but when they had it posted again inside the restaurant, I made sure to go back and grab anything that even looked remotely interesting to the zombies that were milling about. \n\nLittle did I know that the real robbery would occur after we got our food. \n\nThe curry was very thin, almost water. All of the dishes came on shallow plates, five dishes later the three of us were still a bit hungry. The spicy beef salad was drenched in sweet dressing. \n\nI've definitely had better. They seem to be doing ok, judging by all of the celebrity photos and the fact that there were several large groups there that night. But I don't see a reason to go back."
"Finally, a place that advertises Spanish sausage and doesn't hand me a Mexican chorizo. I enjoyed a very nice lunch sitting on the back patio the other day. I ordered the cheese and sausage panini. The service was very friendly and I left much happier than when I arrived."
"Deduct.  Apparently whatever they said they fixed last time I was here, they failed to fix.  Either something broke again after they repaired it or they didn't fix it at all, or something.  Chances are pretty good I'll be back here again, (hopefully Doug will be back from vacation by then) but for now, two stars."
"I'm gonna keep this review short and simple.\n\nFood: 1/5\nService 1/5\n\nPork chop extremely overcooked (see pic)\nLobster Bisque: extremely salty\n\nService: had to ask for water refills, notified about soup and he said he would let the chef know, no other options for soup offered.\nPork chop was dry and hard told server (Dennis) and he just said \""oh\"" and walked away never to be seen again. Thanks Silverado steakhouse for the outstanding experience for my Christmas dinner. I will never step foot near your establishment again nor would I ever recommend you.\n\nYelpers beware!"
"THIS IS THE WORST MASSAGE ENVY I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!!! I have been a member with massage envy for over 4 years and never had a BAD massage.  Sure, I've had therapists that weren't my favorite but never a massage I could not wait until it was over!  Last week that was the case!  I booked an hour and half massage because work had been so stressful!  The therapist was late by about 5 minutes and then took forever to get going.  Once she got going it was seriously just like someone was lightly applying sunscreen on my back.  She would rub a few circles on my back; switch sides do the same thing, then switch back and do the same thing - for 90 minutes!  Meanwhile the whole time sighing like she hated being there!  She never did any other part of my body than the small circle rubs on my back.  It felt like time was going by so slowly all I wanted to do was leave!\n\nI finally called back the next day and talked to the manager about this poor experience.  She assured me that this was a onetime mistake and invited me to come back in and give their location another chance.  She offered to give me a one hour massage with one of their \""best and most requested\"" therapists free of charge.  I agreed and went back in.\n\nI went in for my re-do last night.  First, I checked in with the receptionist who was clearly reading the notes from the manager after I called her.  She brought one of her friends in the back office out to read it as well.  At one point there were 3 people reading the notes about me calling in and complaining.  They were all talking about it which was so awkward because I was sitting 4 feet away and could hear everything!  Ten minutes after my massage was supposed to start the girl finally came and got me.  The massage itself was better, but not by much.  When she finished I thought to myself, \""That was short\"" and then looked up at the clock.  It was still 10 minutes until 7 O'clock when my massage was supposed to be over!  So I really only got a 40ish minute massage! \n\nI went to check out and there was a new girl at the front who made a very bratty comment of \""was everything up to your standards this visit?\"" I said it was OK and left.\n\nDo not waste your time or money by going to this location!  You will regret it!"
Puke Palace!!!\n\nAdvisory: This location ONLY!\n\nI use to come here on my lunch breaks because it was right next to where I used to work. I would walk here almost once a week...JUST FOR CONVENIENCE! We only got a half hour lunch so I had to go somewhere close and the only other option was Mc Donald's and I'm not a big fan! \n\nSo hmmm where do I begin? Yes its that bad! \n\nOk the 1st time I came here I ordered a bacon cheese burger combo which after tax was like $8.00bucks!!!...OMG it took 20 minutes for me to get my order which meant I had to scarf this nasty sickening burger down in 5 mins because I still had to walk back to work and clock in! \n\nNot to mention on top of it taking forever to cook it was under cooked I saw it was rare pink!!! I was so pissed off and had no time to complain I just ate the thing and left to work. \n\nI tried this place a few more times only because I didn't have time to eat anywhere else. \n\nThe second time I ate here I tried there chicken strips. UMMM they were tasty but had blue dots streaming through them...not sure what that was but hey I'm still living! \n\nAfter trying various items I came to realize the only tasty and safe thing to order was their chili cheese fries which after tax came to almost 6 bucks for a large. \n\nLuckily I do not nearby anymore and will NOT be returning! \n\n*NASTY FOOD \n*OVER PRICED \n*DIRTY AND FILTHY DINE IN \n*DRUGGED OUT EMPLOYEES \n\nPS: The employees are ALL NASTY and DRUGGED OUT!!! \n\nI witnessed an employee with dirty finger nails. Also no washing of hands or gloves while touching raw and cooked food. This location seems more of a health department issue than anything else. \n\nPlease if you can avoid eating at THIS Dairy Queen Please avoid it! at all costs!
"Sat at the bar for a quick glass of wine and to order some food to go. I ordered A glass of red wine. It was good, i don't know if it was worth 9$ a glass though. The bartender seemed a little mad I wanted half spinach, half romain on my Cesar salad. I'm picky, but I am nice about it. We ordered the spinach pear Gorgonzola pizza. It came out cold, and wasn't that amazing. Probably wouldn't come back."
I have been a loyal customer since 1999. Makes me sad to right a bad review but since high schools closed their campuses Steves place has deteriorated tremendously. I went in as usual for lunch ordered my sub and returned to work with the wrong sandwich. I ate it upset but so hungry after picking off the dreadful items. I called spoke with a nice man who said come in I will write ur name down. I did and 4 people playing around in the back told me I need to speak with owner which I said no problem and their response was he is out of town. They all thought it was funny and I was so upset. If Steve's crazy sub ever goes out of business it will be because of the horrible customer service from his teenage and one grown man who seem to not care if customers ever comeback. Steve please read this and several others I have read that your staff needs to go. I hope someday I will be treated as a customer and maybe even get the sub I paid for.
"Poor Customer Service! I visit this location fairly often but tonight was the worst! Marvin, the manager took my order, and got it wrong. When I explained to him it wasn't what I ordered nor was it what he repeated back he basically shrugged his shoulders and said oh well. He did nothing to rectify the issue, not even a simple apology which I would have gladly accepted as mistakes happen. I asked for the corporate number and he said its on the website. I jumped right on the website to a \""contact us\"" form. Site stated the business hours are from 8a-5p and it may take 96 hours to respond as the personally respond to all messages. Approximately 10 minutes after I hit submit, I get this generic email stating we're sorry you're not pleased! I'm not buying it at all. I enjoy wingstop but I will not be returning. Throughout my years in customer service I've learned customers will tolerate a lot but poor service isn't one of them!"
"Great place for a quick, healthy bite, featuring flatbreads, wraps, panninis, salads, soups...even quesadillas!  No matter what you choose, you know exactly how many calories are in each (the calorie count is next to each menu item). \n\nI devoured the chipotle chicken wrap (380 calories). The veggies were plentiful and fresh, and the flatbread was the perfect thickness--soft but not flimsy. The chipotle sauce was flavorful, with just the right amount of heat.  My only complaint is the smaller portion of chicken--more is always better.  Try the peppadew hot sauce on your meal!  Wayyyyy better than Tabasco. \n\nIt would be PERFECT if there was one located closer to Scottsdale...So many tasty options, all at very reasonable prices--$5 got me the wrap, a drink and my choice of chips, a cookie or a brownie.  Beat that, Subway!"
"It's been almost a year & a half since I reviewed this place, so it seemed time for an update!  Mike C. joined me today, & the food theme was Mexican.  They have remodeled the place, gotten rid of the \""Old West\"" theme, & mostly gotten rid of the maze of booths you had to wend through to find your way back to your table from the serving area.\n\nAfter some excellent Albondigos Soup, it was on to the nice salad bar, which included real pieces of bacon, creamy cottage cheese, a good selection of cold fruit, & so on.  Unfortunately, it was somewhat downhill after that, as the \""Mexican\"" food was VERY gringo-ized & blah, apparently prepared for the Minnesota palate, certainly not for us around here who eat spicy Mexican food on a regular basis.\n\nWith that said, I still think this is a good place, & I'll keep it at 4-Stars...  just don't come on a Thursday unless you want VERY mild \""Mexican\"" food!\n\nLunch Buffet $9.50 or $8.55 for members of their (free) Fortune Club."
"Wow! I can't believe how wrong my meal was! I ordered the Chicken Banana Flower Salad for $8.75. While the dressing/lettuce/banana flower part of the salad was fine, what they served as \""chicken\"" was absolutely ridiculous!\nHave you ever made chicken broth from scratch? You boil a chicken until the meat is falling off the bone, let it cool, then pick through the pot....pulling out bones, cartilage and skin. Well THAT is what the \""chicken\"" in my salad consisted of.....bones, cartilage and skin! I seriously could not believe it....there was NO chicken meat of ANY kind! Just the scraps that one would normally throw away.\nI called the older gentleman that had waited on us over and showed him the bones and skin, to which he replied, \""Oh, well next time tell us you want it without bones and skin.\"" \nUm, excuse me? Is this guy for real? \nIf you're going to serve nothing but bones, skin, and cartilage, then you should call it a chicken BONE or chicken SKIN banana blossom salad, so that people understand what you are actually intending on serving them!  \nI was cool when he said this at first, thinking that I may have just hit a bad patch in the salad, but with my very next bite it was exactly the same thing....a big, splintery chicken bone with absolutely ZERO meat on it, covered by a pile of lettuce, chicken skin, and banana blossoms. \nTo their credit, when I finally realized that enough was enough and sent it back, they were VERY accomodating and made me a different salad, right away. \nI think it was a shrimp pork salad, and it was very tasty.\nI also noticed several of the employees huddled around the chicken bone salad that I had sent back. They were speaking vietnamese? thai? to what I'm assuming was the cook and pointing at the bones and skin, so OBVIOUSLY this was not actually the way that this salad was supposed to be served. And I must admit that I think it's a good sign that they actually checked it out, and LOOKED at what was going on with the salad, instead of just writing me off as a pain-in-the-ass customer, because atleast it shows that they care about the food they are serving. And hell, anyone can make a mistake.\nIn fact, I'd probably have only given them one star, except for the fact that they actually seemed concerned.\nMy boyfriend ordered Pad See Ew. He said it was okay. Not the best he's ever had, but certainly edible. \nI think if we ever try this place again, we'll just get the Vietnamese sandwiches or the Pho, as it appears from other reviewers that this is what they're best at."
I traceled over 30 miles for this cut of meat.  Thinking the best place to get if was a meat market/butchet....WRONG!!!  I purchased a 7# prime rib worth over $100 and found it to be the worst cut of meat....especially from a butcher.  It was grisly and full of fat more than I've ever seen on this type of meat.  Sorry won't be going back.
"AWFUL experience today...long story short, I am looking for a new dentist. I love our old one, but he's a little far from our house...so, I started by getting recommendations from my area parenting board (the best board EVER). From there I narrowed it down to 3 offices and despite my broken arm, took Truman in his Service Dog vest off to check them out in person. I had a fairly dreadful experience at Dr. Michael Zacher's office. For those of you that don't know, I am a disabled person with a service dog. He is a hypoallergenic poodle and extremely well behaved. I was instructed by Dr. Zacher's Office Manager Rhonda that my dog was not welcome in their office (which by the way is beautiful with tv's, comfy leather sofas and a children's play room). I explained to her that under federal law, a Service Animal cannot be denied access to a facility. And, that I have NEVER in all my time with him (going on 3 years) been asked to leave. I can assure you that I am a very pleasant, nice (even fun) person. Truman was nestled near my feet having a snooze while this happened. He was not in any way disruptive. She told me that she would ask Dr. Zacher. About 15 minutes later Rhonda called back and told me the 'there was not a good fit', and that I could not use Dr. Zacher for my dental needs. I am very upset at being treated in this manner. After all if I had come in with a cane, would I have been denied access? The only recourse I have is to report back to you here and ask you to consider this when making your choices."
"Item are cleaned and ready as scheduled, they offer inexpensive but quality work, and decent hours of operations.\n\nNote, there is a drive through for those of you with children!"
"I think the other reviews are unfair.  This place does not pretend to be a high-end eatery.  The food is for college kids who working through a hangover or need to load up for an all-nighter.  That said, this place does the job.  I stopped there after a long car ride from BMI airport.  I was starving so everything tasted good (though  also had to remove a good amount of the fries to eat the sandwich like another reviewer).  It did take a really long time to get the sandwich even though the place only had 1 or 2 other customers.   I had no problem with the bathrooms but I imagine they are in worse shape on the weekends after everyone's been out to the bar.\nThey have rolls of paper towels at the tables instead of typical paper napkins.  I did have to use a lot of them after unwrapping my sandwich.\n\nBasically a 2 star type of restaurant; sandwich shop/fast food, but it does a 4 star job of it.  Good, but the food could use a little more 'engineering' to taste better vs just paying for a lot of calories."
The worst customer experience we have ever received! My family and I were going to purchase some new books like we have done many times before but the way we were treated by a B&N employee (older women wearing glasses) was anything but family friendly! If you're a miserable person please refrain from dealing with the public. Looks like Amazon will have to be my new book source.
"Zero knowledge about insurance billing and general office procedures. Office manager argues and has a bad attitude. I would not recommend this place, nor will I ever schedule another appointment. Go to Lenscrafters if you have Tricare/United Healthcare."
"I took my family here for dinner about a week ago. The one thing I was disappointed with is their salad bar selection. I used to frequent Ruby Tuesday's years ago and their selection was larger. However, I guess since their salad bar selection is smaller, they offer more food menu items. I ordered the flavored iced tea and I was impressed that the server mixes it up for me in person. I also love the shrimp dip appetizer. I ordered the chicken broccoli. It was delicious. I know next time to have my sons split a food dish instead of getting their own. Our server was prompt and polite. We left there stuffed."
"Fun to Play - but not to Stay.\n\n\nYou get what you pay for - Harrah's is not the worst place to stay, it's a great price for the location Center Strip, but the rooms, especially the bathrooms are small (though you do get a small balcony if you stay in the Mardi Gras tower.  Their check in desk is hands down the slowest in Las Vegas (i've stayed all over the strip, and it's not even close)  \n\nThe hotel amenities are among the worst on the strip.  Their pool is super small and has maybe 50 chairs available (great for place with close to 1000 rooms).  The spa was just awful, standing water everywhere a sauna that never got hot and a hot tub that all but required quarters to keep it going.  \n\nOn the brightside - Harrah's is a fun place to gamble, the dealers are fun and table mins are low and the cocktail waitresses are on top of thing.  Their sports book, while not the biggest is pretty nice as well."
"This place is truly a hidden gem located in Downtown Las Vegas.  They serve delicious food at rock bottom pricing!  Even if I'm staying at a 5 Star Resort, I take the trip to the Market Street Cafe to get a feeling of what old time Vegas was like.  \n\nThe staff is very friendly and hard working.  The restaurant itself is very clean and spacious.  You come in hungry and leave fully satisfied.  \n\nI highly recommend their Steak and Eggs as well as their Tocino and eggs specials.  Most guests stop by late night for their Oxtail Soup.  I have yet to try it but eventually will.  \n\nI actually started salivating while writing this review.... hahaha  \n\ncan't wait to get back."
"There was something just a little off about this restaurant.  Maybe the fact that it was virtually deserted influenced my perception, but the interior was just too dark and gloomy, this despite the fact that our table had a picture window view of the Las Vegas strip in its full neon glory.\n\nThe hostess seated us at a table that was broken--the bench seat backs were gone and were \""being repaired.\""  There were at least two other similar tables on either side of us, so I dont know why she seated us there.\n\nAt first our server had a bit of an attitude, but she became very pleasant later on, so I forgive that.\n\nAnyway, the sushi was okay, not spectacular.  I did enjoy the monk fish liver.  But the California roll was mealy.  Also, eel is suppose to be served warm, mine was cold and tasted refrigerated.  The tempura was kinda greasy, which is just unacceptable.  The Saki selections and mixed drinks were very good.  \n\nOverall, a ho-hum experience.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the sushi restaurants in San Francisco, but this place just isnt up to snuff."
"All the staff are very friendly and upbeat . . . loud music pumping from the speakers . . . it's more of a party than anything. When there is a long line at the window, the staff run out to the cars beyond and take orders so when you get to the window, your drinks are ready. It's definitely an indulgement to get a specialty coffee as they are a little pricey (except for $3 happy-hour), but I allow myself one every couple of weeks. The loyalty card is great so you can earn stamps toward a free coffee of your choice. I absolutely prefer Dutch Brothers to Starbucks any day of the week!"
"We had a big work dinner at the MGM Grand location on a random Tuesday night.   It was a relatively big group and I realize that the restaurant is NOT designed for such groups.  However, everything was sub-par.  The salad was ok - apple/walnut with lettuce - too much dressing and not enough flavor.  The app was really salty - shrimp with some sort of creole sauce BUT the worst part was the awful biscuit - hard and dry.  The main was salmon for me with andouille sauage.  The sausage was AWESOME but that salmon was dry and not good.  My colleagues had the steak and the restaurant over cooked most of them - well done steak should NOT be served esp for a fancy work event.  Lastly, the dessert - bread pudding.  It was not good - tasted like oatmeal with cinnamon sprinkles.  Overall, I was disappointed and would NOT go back there again."
"My girlfriend has been raving about the Rainforest Cafe and her experiences that she has had with them in Chicago, so when we saw one was available at the MGM Grand (which is just a quick walk from the Excalibur where we're staying), I got a bit excited based on that.\n\nBeing inside the MGM Grand, I expected expensive but the cheapest meal item I found was $15+. That's a bit too much to pay for a salad without a drink. The waiter seemed nice and offered me a margarita or beer. A margarita would have cost $11 to start so I just ordered a Coke (which was $3 I believe.) I ordered the appetizer sampler because it seemed I'd at least get quite a bit of food for my money.\n\nNow, I knew that the reason for the expense would be the convenience of being inside the MGM Grand and the 'show' that is put on by being surrounded by a \""rainforest\"" of sorts. The entire thing is animatronic and features a storm that goes off every half hour or so. Honestly, I found the whole thing laughably cheesy and couldn't believe this is what we were paying extra for. The entire thing would have been impressive If I was much younger and living in the 1980's.... MAYBE.\n\nAs for the quality of service, it was mediocre at best. The table next to us was seated and ordered later, but had their drinks refilled before mine. The waiter often disappeared and it took my girlfriend asking him to get drinks refilled. Food was okay, nothing special and nothing I'd pay extra for.\n\nAll in all, not impressed."
"I should have payed attention to all the warning signs and ran away.  In a strip mall strike one when it comes to bbq. No smoke smell whatsoever.  Strike 2. 1st plate came out fully sauced.  Strike 3. I should have been out of there.  But I had a Groupon.  Sigh\n\nOrdered 3 meat plate with ribs, rib tips and brisket. Came out all sauced and brisket chopped. This is a good way to hide bad bbq. I asked if the sliced brisket and they tried to to tell me it was.  Please sell this to someone who is clueless not someone who had reviewed 30 plus bbq restaurants from great to awful.\n\nFinally got my plate and was really unimpressed.  Everything was lackluster.  Rib tips sigh, ribs sigh and the pulled pork okay. It all needed the sauce.  Not good for a bbq place.  No smoke ring or Smokey flavor. I almost doubt there is a smoker on the premises.  Not sure outside of the sauce I would even call this bbq. \n\nThe sides mac and cheese and baked beans were better than the meats but still not awesone. \n\nThe one thing that earned this place a second star was the 1 dollar banana pudding. This is worth a stop just for dessert.  As I would never go here for any other reason.  The banana pudding itself earned this place the second star. \n\nI would not recommend stopping here of you like good bbq whatsoever."
Wonderful place for burgers.   The trio was a great way to try 3 different options.   Tyson our waiter was wonderful.   He took care of everthing we needed and in a timely fashion.  We will be back again soon.
"Well......No self parking to begin with. You either Valet or park in the California's lot a block away. The room is TINY, yet modern and comfortable. The bathroom is TINY and at an incline so luckily they have a warning about that or youd fall flat on your face walklng into the bathroom! Hallways are narrow and short so never a long walk from the elevator. The casino is ALWAYS busy and you do notice that they really need to do something about the smell in there.\n\nDespite all this, its still not a bad place......unless youre looking for a pool in which case i'll let you know when i'm done laughing"
This place is CLOSED now. Waaaa! So take your stingy butts to Chipotle 3 stores down.  They got $5 burritos but NO FREE CHIPS! We will miss that!
Excellent food! Tasty and filling ... comparable to Chipotle with some items that are not available there.
"I ordered a beef and cheese sandwich, which was forgettable. It was beefy, but flavorless. Considering that I have spent time in the East Coast, this in no way resembles hot sandwiches out there. I also found it to be on the expensive side. Their sides look interesting, but will sample them only if I'm in the area, which is right off the Meadows Mall and the 95."
Delicious Pho and summer rolls. Have also had it to go which is nice. Service could he a bit friendlier. Great Thai iced read and iced coffee!! Parking can be a bit tricky but there is extra parking around back!
"For me, this is heaven. \n\nI love to see all of the new styles and seasonal colors on display. It truly makes me happy. The very best part is the sale wall all the way to the back. It's a glorious oasis of size 4's just waiting for me to come by and pluck them, like ripened grapes from the vine :) Delightful!"
"Wonderful food, terrible ambiance. Better for take-out, as the name would suggest. \nFantastic eggplant, beautiful curries, great drunken noodles. Swallow your capsaicin pride and order a notch low on the 1-10 scale; they don't mess around. The thai iced tea was not as good as I hoped, but it was free with a checkin, so I can't complain.\n\nFour stars overall for fantastic food minus terrible ambiance. You're going to a restaurant to eat, after all."
"Such a great atmosphere, friendly staff and a wide variety of sushi/non sushi. Such a great surprise, can't wait to go back again!"
"I was harassed, belittled, embarrassed and even physically manhandled by Jay, one of the managers. When I asked to speak to his boss because I was so insulted by how he was treating a woman he physically laid his hands on me, rubbing my back all while telling me that he was so high up in management that he could do whatever he wanted. I have never been treated so poorly, will NEVER return or recommend this place. Jay needs to be fired... or arrested!"
"I am giving one star for a reason...  I used to love this place, food quality was good and service was great.  But that all change today, and it was unbelievable what the server had told me.  The Nigiri was not fresh today, food was ok.  The service I would give 0 star if I could.  Every time we are trying to order, the server always give us this bad look.  And we don't really eat that much, trust me.  The worst part was the server lie to us in our face saying there is a limit of the Ice Cream per person...  Which is not true and I told her I have been here plenty time.  She immediate change her story saying it is not limited \""BUT I THINK EACH OF YOU HAVE 1 MOCHI ICE CREAM AND 1 REGULAR ICE CREAM I THINK THATS ENOUGH FOR YOU GUYS\""  I seriously start to laugh and tell her forget about it.  And this is my first time in my life left a $0 tips.  I thought it's AYCE!!!!  As a business owner, I feel sorry for Sushi Wa owner to have staff like that."
"We stayed at the Flamingo last week since my friend had a free night from the last time he was booked there.  During that time, the front desk lost his reservation and apparently was very unhelpful with finding him another spot to stay...leaving him stranded to fend for himself on his first night in Vegas.\n\nWe got a late flight so checked in at 11:30pm (after an hour long wait).  the room we requested was unavailable, even though we called ahead of time to make sure they still had our reservation and our room.  They preceded to check us into a temporary room with a room change to be made the next morning.  Renee on the front desk was a sweetheart and the only person in the hotel who really seemed to care.  We preceded up to our room and all of a sudden I started coughing and sneezing and was having a severe allergic reaction.  My friend went out in the hallway to get ice and noticed we were in one of the only \""Pet Friendly\"" rooms in the hotel.  I have severe allergies to pets and no one informed us that it was a pet room.  We called down and were placed on hold for 15 mins when we decided to not waste our first night there and hung up to head downstairs to the casino.  We came back to our room at an obscene hour only to find ourselves locked out of our room.  I guess the reasoning was that they changed our room and keys but neglected to tell us this.\n\nThe next morning we phoned front desk to see if our room was ready.  They gave us a timeline of 1pm but when we went to get our new room keys,  the room was still not ready.  Were were given a fantastic room on the 20th floor with a strip view, which is what we wanted in the first place. The only plus of this whole experience.\n\nWhen we checked out we had a charge of 160$ in internet...OUT OF THIS WORLD.  when we explained to them how disappointed we were, and how the internet barely worked, the front desk (including supervisor) refused to do anything about it.  They also blamed us for not reading the terms and conditions or telling them about my allergy.  Internet is charged per person per location, so 3 charges were from our initial room., and another 3 from the new room..in the same day.  We had to ask for the number to the internet company and call from our Canadian cell phones because apparently all the phones in the Flamingo are for in house, which I know is a complete lie.  I work in a hotel and this is by far the WORST customer service I've ever received. If the Flamingo is supposed to be this wonderful \""centre of the strip, historic, Vegas resort\"", the staff should stand beside it. We never heard an apology out of anyone.  The internet company ended up taking off the charges for us, and could not believe that the front desk did nothing about it.\n\nI will NOT stay here again, even though the casino, restaurants and rooms were great for the price.  Customer service is #1 and I was overly disappointed with the service received."
"we loved our suite!!! gorgeous and clean.\nnoise level---none, but maybe its because we came in the winter season.\nwill definitely stay here again...\nbtw, out suite with separate living room was 45bucks/night----awesome deal!!!!"
"Really Excellent food, with an authentic feel. I've had Vietnamese food in many locations in Montreal (and other cities) and this one ranks high for service, and overall food quality. Looking forward to trying something new on their menu on a future visit !"
"2/5 standard chinese.\n\ni'll start off by saying it was my fault for getting chinese in phoenix. but a senior in my office was heading there, so of course i had to go. the food is standard chinese/cornstarch fare, though i'm sure there is a saving chef's specialty dish."
"Beautiful hotel retreat right on the Strip. Since there's no casino in here, it's nice to come back to a quiet hotel to pass out. Lobby is located on the 23rd floor and all the hotel rooms are 22nd floor and below (23 floor and up are private residences). The lobby area is pretty grand and it's definitely a really nice way to be welcomed into Vegas. \n\nService is good but there were a few details that were missed (like...forgetting to clean our room haha). I wouldn't say the service here is more spectacular than what you can get at other nice hotels but I'm just being snooty. Esp if you're going to pay a premium for staying here. \n\nThey do have a complimentary house car that will take you anywhere but check with downstairs since it never seems to be available. We only used it on our last day when we finally snagged a ride to the airport (actually, it wasn't available but we said we'd wait for it since we weren't in a rush). \n\nAlso key? There's a 24-hour CVS located right next door for all your late night munchies as well as a Starbucks right outside the hotel. Also, it's located right next to Aria & City Center so from a location stand point, it's pretty damn convenient."
I bought Biz In A Boxx twice.  Once for my son and once for a friend's son.  Both kids had incredible experiences with the product.  My friends son has the middle level and actually started a business online buying and selling rare Lego pieces!  He makes a transaction fee on each purchase and has made a small fortune!
"Gay nightlife is Vegas is sad.\n\nWe went to Piranha, because we were in the neighborhood. They had a line at 2:30 on Friday, so Saturday - we returned for the full experience. We thought, hey, we never see that in SF. Must be a good sign.\n\nSigns can be misleading.\n\nThe club is an interesting space, it's got a VIP area (who knows why) and then a general floor. Everything is small, bars are laced through the area along with people who were awfully cocky. Drinks were crappy and uber-expensive, I had a Three Olives Grape and soda for $10. And it tasted more like Perrier with Splenda.\n\nThere was a go-go boy here who couldn't dance at all. It was like watching a limp piece of beef flop around. Yuck. You can tell if a go-go boy is straight or not, by the way he dances. And this one was straight. The other one was the better \""straight\"" go-go boy.\n\nA Piranha with a lack of a bite. Maybe, next time it would be worth it to do VIP. But other than, as the old saying goes . . . \""there's no place like home.\"""
"It only gets 2 stars bc the beer is very good. Other than that, everything else completely sucks!!! Service is slow.... We started off with the ice cold \""fresh\"" pretzels..yuck..my husband got the fish and chips. The fish was very watery( as if it was frozen fish). I got the prime rib dip... Bland as can be! The au jus was basically brown water... And I paid a $1 up charge for onions rings... I got 4 of them... Rip off! The prices are wayyy too high for the crap food you receive! Beware people!"
"These are hands down the best chicken fingers I've ever had. Get the \""special sauce.\"" Get a second; it's worth it. They use a recipe developed in Alabama. \n\nI live in the northwest valley and I'm kind of glad. Because if I lived in Tempe, I'd be 15-20 lbs heavier because I'd be gorging myself at this place once a week."
"A fantastic little locally owned dive in South Scottsdale. I can't count how many times I've driven past George's, but I never had a desire to stop in because the strip mall it's located in is pretty shady looking. But then I read all the good reviews and decided I had to check it out. I'm glad I did. \n\nThe menu (which is posted on the wall, and takes up a lot of space) is huge. In addition to the pitas, there are pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, burgers, platters, and appetizers (both Greek and American). The very friendly girl at the counter wasn't even able to tell me what the best items were, but that's because a guy sitting just inches away started to rave about everything. I decided to go with the Original Gyro (hey, the place is call George's Famous Gyros, after all. It's $6.75 and comes with a salad or fries (I went with the salad). I also tried the Baklava since the raving customer told me it was the best he's ever had.\n\nThe Gyro was phenomenal. As good as any Gyro place I've ever eaten at. It's all from Chicago, and you can taste it! It looks small at first, but you'll be surprised at how much meat the pita is filled with. I recommend paying the extra 25 cents for extra sauce. The Gyro is so stuffed with lamb, that you'll appreciate the flavor it adds. The salad is pretty big, but it's pretty much just a standard Greek salad. The Baklava was great, but pretty small even for it's $2.25 price. I would also suggest that George's drop the salad or fries and charge a dollar or two less for the Gyro a la cart. I really didn't want either, and would've preferred to save the cash. The wait for my food also felt a little long, but its probably because most of the food was made fresh, so I can live with that. I got my money's and taste bud's worth, and then some. I'll definitely be back at George's Famous Gyros to see what else is good here."
I came here for a staycation and couldn't be happier. The room is fabulous and the hotel exceeds my expectations.  Food court is a hot mess. Eat before you get here.
"This club is really cool, great place to take your girl for drinks and still be able to talk to her. Cheap to get in, elevator ride up is fun because you see the whole strip up. The view from the club itself is amazing, drinks are pricey but well made and strong. Must check it out."
"Interesting place. We sat in the bar at 6:30 on a Sat night and it was pretty empty. It turns into a bar later on and is open until 5 am. We ordered a porterhouse (surfs for free and the shrimp were delicious), brussels sprout side (wonderful and cooked al dente), potatoes au gratin also excellent but the steak wasn't super thick and the Caesar had bland dressing.  The calamari starter was mediocre because of the breading but the spicy marina was very good.  We would go back and try a few appetizers off the happy hour menu $8 but it was fairly expensive considering the quality.  I would opt for a drink at the bar once it gets busy or a quick stop on the way home from the airport so we will return. Be sure and join the online club and you will get a $20 credit to use with your first meal just by providing your phone number when you ask for your bill."
Spend a little more and take a taxi. Just rude. Tried to tell us that even though we paid for hotel pick up that we had to walk 3 hotels away. We knew more about the events going on than they did. No accountability.
"It's been awhile since I've paid less than $12 for a movie ticket during prime time, and let me just say it's o so nice. The theater has ample FREE parking (none of this having to validate garbage) and the theater isn't overrun by youngins. The people who frequent here aren't the type to add their own commentaries during the movies which is a breath of fresh air. Its a nice atmosphere and great place to take the kids to a movie. \n   The theater rooms themselves are clean and large. This will now be my go to theater while in Pitts."
"This place is worthless if you need immediate care during the day!!! My kitty has chronic UTIs that can lead to severe and life threatening blockages. On several occasions they have done little or nothing to accommodate him during such instances....stating that they are booked and that I should visit an emergency vet. Well then why am I paying you monthly if you can never see my pet when he needs to be seen? I was told \""you do know this is a wellness clinic?\"" So, apparently sick pets are not a priority for them. The Desert Ridge location is FAR better about getting him in...even when they are full, they squeeze him in between patients. It is a shame, because I really like Dr. Cherico. Furthermore, the techs are not very skilled in handling feisty pets. My other cat does not like coming to the vet, at all, and often becomes very agitated. One instance the techs left me in the room for 20 minutes to try and get my hissing, spitting, and scratching cat in her crate by myself. During a subsequent teeth cleaning she was allowed to scratch herself in her own eye leading to an eye infection that became an ear infection as well. It was awful. I do not recommend the 90th location at all!!!"
"AMAZING\n\nI just had lunch here and it was AMAZING. I love this place. I can't believe it took me this long to stop in! I had the Pad Thai and eggroll. This food is fresh tasting, fulfilling, and pretty inexpensive. I would recommend this place to anyone."
"This is the first and unfortunately last time I will be visiting the Liberty Market. My idea of a good breakfast is good service and an enjoyable, relaxing time, all three of which I did not experience during my visit. \n\nThe place is utter chaos. When you walk in you think that there are available tables, but then someone comes over to you and lets you know that she is \""seating the table right now\"", and you can order and she will find you a place to sit. That's fine, but a sign near the door stating, \""please wait to be seated\"" would solve about 99% of the \""hostess\"" running around and rearranging people, and 100% of the confusion for first time visitors. They would almost serve themselves better by letting people seat themselves....It was stressful enough to watch the poor girl run around trying to seat people. \n\nOn that note, I saw her let people sit down until she had to seat a party, then she made them get up and stand, which I thought was incredibly rude. She also seated my party of two, and after we sat down, SHE MOVED US! To a smaller table. Fine, we are only a party of two, but once you make up your mind on where you are going to seat a party, keep it, its rude to make them move after they have been seated. \n\nWe ordered our food, I got the Chorizo Quesadilla...good, but nothing great that I couldn't get at other establishments. We even commented to each other how the food should be outstanding...it must be for us to want come back, but again, it was nothing to rave about. \n\nThe food took a long time, and the place is LOUD. The busers are around in flurries setting up and taking down tables, but it's beyond impossible to flag one down to get a box for your food at the end of the meal. \n\nWe left more stressed out then full in our bellies. Granted we visited on a busy Sunday morning, but customer service should always be a companies top priority, here it wasn't. I felt like we got nothing but a stressful expensive meal instead. I rated Liberty Market \""fairly\"" at one star, because like the rating says, I think not. I would not visit again, nor would I recommend to my family or friends."
"Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better."
Never eat here. They got my order wrong and put some spicy sauce on my taco that made me throw up.
"Joe's Real BBQ is one of my favorite places. Comfort food in a comfort environment served by friendly people - just the best.\n\nLocated in downtown Gilbert, the historic brick building is solid and homey. We try to visit at non-peak hours or on weeknights, but if you show up at dinner time on a Friday or Saturday, you'll be greeted with a long line of patrons waiting for their opportunity to step up to the counter to order some tasty fixins :) Despite appearances, the long line does not usually entail a long wait - their counter service team has the process down to a science and they move people through relatively quickly. \n\nThe line moves through the dining room with booth style tables to one side and large wooden tables to the other side through the center. Once you reach the front of the line, you make your way past a selection of bottled drinks and up to a soda fountain complete with fresh brewed root beer and home made lemonade (my pick) Grab a tray, napkins, and utensils, then slide on up to the counter. You place your order and move forward while they prepare it. By the time you reach the selection of desserts, your meat and side are landing on the glass top in front of you. I usually go for the BBQ sandwich meal, as it is just enough - 1/4 lb of meat on a bun + 1 side dish. My typical meat of choice is the Chopped Pork, although when I'm trying to be \""healthy\"" (ha!) I also enjoy the extremely moist chicken and turkey offerings as well. As far as side dishes, there's just one choice for me: Cheesy Potatoes. Usually served lukewarm, they're cheesy with just a hint of spice and they're delicious. \n\nNow, the desserts ... I really can't walk away without getting one of their freshly baked chocolate chip cookies: the chips are usually still melty and warm. However, their Rootbeer cake is incredibly moist with a unique, yummy flavor and just a hint of frosting, and my husband loves their lemon cake. They also have a to-die-for corn bread served with honey butter, but I often skip it as I'm so carbed up from everything else I've already ordered (darn) \n\nDon't forget the barbecue sauce! I am actually aghast to say that the first time I had Joe's, I didn't like it! This was because I had the original barbecue sauce, which I've discovered is just too sweet for me. Once I learned about the spicy habenero barbecue sauce, I was good to go - it is delicious and adds the perfect pop of flavor to my sandwich. \n\nIf the weather is nice, skip eating in the dining room and head out to the yard outside. There are rows of picnic tables perched beside a large, grassy lawn which is the perfect place for kids to run around and burn off steam while the adults finish up their meals and chat. The area is bordered by a white picket fence which contains the kiddos from the busy street just beyond, so that you can relax while they play. The whole area is crowned with strings of lights that lend a lovely glow as you dine. If the weather is not-so-nice, I usually try to grab a booth on the far side of the room, so I'm not eating amongst the people standing in line. There is also an enclosed patio area which works well as a hybrid of the two dining experiences - I find that it is a bit noisy usually. \n\nThe restaurant itself is quaint with an obvious Arizona Agriculture theme - my son loves checking out the giant John Deere tractor that holds court at the center of the room, and he often peers longingly into the upcycled fuel pump... now turned into a gumball machine. \n\nIf you're jonesing for Joe's but don't want to wait in line, consider calling ahead and then picking your order up at the window outside - it is a good way to get your fix :) we've also gotten take out for several get togethers that we have hosted/attended and it really takes the pressure off of having to cook because everyone likes Joe's!"
"Went in on a Groupon, food was good but also greasy, but not enuff for me to go out of my way to eat there. \nWent there at lunch, it was dead, but yet took forever to get our food."
"The portions are HUGE! Probably the biggest biscuits I've ever seen (I didn't order them). Amazing, fluffy pancakes and they give you 2 syrups. I built my own omelette and since I don't get any meat, they let me have extra veggies. It seems like it's a very meat centric menu but that's ok. They seem to work with you on things. It's a rustic lodge environment. Family friendly but also free flowing booze. There is a bar and counter with open seating. I'll definitely come back with friends and family. Now I'm going to finish \""m m m my mimosa\"""
Eggs where runny. Yolks where raw. Asked for a diet soda as I am diabetic and can't have juice. The waitress never brought my cold drink and thus I had to attempt to wash my hot food down with my hot coffee. I choked profusely. The waitress did her best to avoid our table with having had only 3 visits to our table. Once for drinks then taking our order and last to give us the check. No tip no return for us. Is customer srvc. Dead???
White guilt told me this was some kind of racial slur against chinese people. Yelp told me it was actually a killer chinese restaurant. Yelp was right! So so so so good!
"My family and I have been to this property for brunches 3 times now. The first two times we went, it was incredible, and definitely one of our favorites in town.\n\nThe view is the best. I enjoy Sanctuary's view all day 5 days a week, and as awesome as it is, I think Copperwynd/Alchemy Restaurant might have a better one. It is a small, trendy, dining room with floor to ceiling windows that can be rolled up to make the entire dining room open to the elements. It is located off the lobby, but has a very cozy entry way which seperates it just enough to make you feel as though you aren't in a resort.\n\nOur first visit back in 2006 was a champagne brunch that featured one of the best seafood selections we had seen at a brunch. Coming from my family, that's saying a lot, as they do brunches all the damn time. The food was incredible that day with perfect service. The second visit was much the same. \n\nThis time though...\n\nOne salad looked as though they opened a bag of Redi-Mix and dumped it in a bowl. The quality of their seafood display is now down to shrimp cocktail, smoked oysters/salmon, and crab legs. The actual fish quality is decent, and just decent. \n\nService on this visit was really hit and miss as well. The executive chef came out and talked to every table, and the bussers were spot on with drink service and clearing plates/folding napkins when you went for another food run. On the flip side of that, our waitress had us waiting for new silverware, and bringing my mom the wrong type of hot tea twice. Also, the kid behind the prime rib carving station needs to be taught customer service. He literally stared at me from when I was 10' from the station up until I got there. I waited for him to greet me and it never happened so finally I started putting horseradish on my plate hoping he would get the point and he started carving meat. Not a big deal, but it was just a lot of little stuff that piled up. Perhaps the biggest thing is they have done away with the champagne, and didn't lower the price of the buffet. \n\nI'm fine with the service, food, and having to pay for my champagne if you don't charge me $54 per person for the buffet. Wrigley Mansion has their buffet priced at $62 with a MUCH more elaborate selection, live music, champagne, and a staff that is as close to perfect as it gets. Sorry Copperwynd, but if you guys are trying to scale back, you're doing it in the wrong place... quality is not a place to skimp!"
"What a great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The beer list is extensive and amazing!  There is something on there for everyone, whether or not you are a beer lover.  The food is equally amazing- the steamed mussels are one of my favorites.  It's a fun, energetic atmosphere.  I always make sure to hit this place up whenever I am in town."
"Celebrated my mother-in-law 70th birthday dinner, the food was ok...some of the vegetables were cold, lobster tail was a bit salty; however the servers were nice."
It's OKAY. I don't go here regularly actually I only come here for lunch break at work. It's not too bad but not authentic. Their pollo fundido chimichanga is good rice and beans not so good. The service is not so great the food is better than the service. If I had a choice between here and else where is see what the other choice is first lol.
"Karla is absolutely the BEST hairdresser in town!  She is personable and attentive while in her chair.  As owner of the salon, she cares about her staff and ensures they are all learning new techniques and styles often.  The salon is ecclectic and fun and always very clean!  And being right beside The Common Market is just an added bonus!!"
My friend and I were coming back from a business trip and had a 2 hour layover in the Vegas airport. We decided to grab some dinner. Service was a little weird. I ordered a quesadilla to share with my friend and a burrito for my entree. The waiter looks at me and ask you gonna eat all that?  I wanted to say on second thought No. We are leaving. Should have as he food was not very good either. Next time I need something to eat in the Vegas airport I won't be going there.
"This review is for the Phoenix Airport Location.\nI wish I could give the establishment and endless supply of negative stars, but alas...one will have to do! Currently renting a Jeep Wrangler from Fox for a 10 day road trip. Thought it was going to be a smooth ride but unbeknownst to us we got SLAMMED with additional fees! Beatriz made several up sells that seemed like they were for the week, when in fact they are for the day. My hat is off to her, she is a good saleswoman, and should probably start selling used cars...she could make a fortune. Going further, their customer service is horrible over the phone. We were transferred several times, each time the person on the other end of the phone knew less and less. The only thing we did find out was you can not change or cancel any of the add-ons over the phone. My advice to everyone is go with a company that treats you with respect, and does not take full advantage of you. Go with a reputable company like Enterprise. Fox should change their name to Wolf."
"When you've graduated from Taco Bell and it's too depressing inside an empty Roberto's, you're ready for Cafe Rio and its addictive fresh awesomeness. \n\nDon't get me wrong: you won't forget the Los Tacos of the world, and I still love a good lunch at Mariana's. But Cafe Rio is wonderful. Big fan of both barbacoa and grilled salmon. Whole menu is great and worth the extra buck over your average fast-casual spot."
"Centennial Toyota has been our go to spot for car shopping for years. My family got a total of four cars from them (one lease) and while the salespeople are usually polite and not very pushy, the price you get might not be great and the service for the few visits i personally had were pretty horrendous.\n\nMy recent experience at Toyota was less than pleasant though. It was a big waste of time. I convinced my girlfriend and her sister to check out centennial toyota simply because my history with them and naturally i expected a rather fantastic quote from them. I did my research and called several dealership as well as printed the true price paper from U.S news cars website, I even had a friend who sent me their receipt from Henderson toyota for the exactly the same car. \n\nI started off by letting my gf test drive the car and then the scary negotiation begins. The salesperson was very polite but let me say my previous purchase and my loyalty played absolutely no part in the negotiation process. I was quoted $3000 more than the true car pricing gotten off of the cars website and about $3500 more than what our friend got at Henderson. What bothers me the most is that the salesperson kept asking for my bottom line. It's safe to say that he missed the point, he was playing the bargaining game with me and I just wanted a hassle-free experience. After we told him we will visit another dealership and my gf's mom has to co-sign with her on the car even if we buy it right now, he looked dismayed and became obviously less excited about us. He somewhat hastily ended the conversation and gave us a not so great price written on the back of his business card and we left very unsatisfied. He never mentioned anything about the $25 test drive gift card btw even though I showed him the coupon that they sent us. The whole thing took almost two hours.\n\nWe went straight to fletcher jones afterward, and guess what, we bought our car there the same day. Their initial offer and the only offer for the same car beats the Centennial quote by around $4000 and the recent graduate discount was $750 vs. $500 from centennial. Yes, the cars were exactly the same with door protector being the only difference. We had NO negotiation because we felt the price was great and all of us were surprised how easy it was. With signing and everything it took about 3 hours total. \n\nCentennial later sent me an email after I told them my disappointment. The manager simply told me that I should've just called them and that they will not be beaten by any body on price. That's completely missing the point. If they offered me a good price and played no bargaining game with me in the first place, I would probably spent a little more to save the trouble. It's safe to say my loyalty with this place is completely gone. \n\nWill I go back to Centennial Toyota? Probably, since buying a car is all about playing these games. I am not sure if buying at Fletcher Jones can as easy as this one. But will I ever convince somebody to go to Centennial simply because my so called \""Loyalty\"", absolutely not. There is no loyalty, at least not with what happened to me."
"Battista's. Hot dang, the food was gross. Terribly, terribly gross. My manicoti was just a solid block of bad cheese with pergo-like sauce on it. But then it was paired with something (spinach) that was inedible. Seriously, I don't know how one makes spinach taste like that, my only guess would be artificial flavoring. Yes, it's that type of place. Then cap it off with cheap wine that'll give you a killer headache and some sweet hot chocolate standing in for coffee. Blech."
"This is the most unprofessional dentist office we have ever been to! From the first phone call to make an appointment to the first visit and exam, we have been completely unsatisfied! \n\nThey never explained what was being done and made us feel bad when my daughter had milk for breakfast when we were never told she couldn't have dairy prior to her appointment. \n\nMy daughter was in so much pain she came out crying. When I asked them if it should be pressure and not pain that she feels he dismissively said, \""sure!\""\n\nThen they never gave us after care instructions. I had to call them when I got home to find out if she needed to wait an hour before she could eat or if it was okay to give her motrin even though she had laughing gas. \n\nPrior to this, my daughter loved going to the dentist. If you do not want your child traumatized, do not go to this dentist. They are unprofessional and do not care!"
"Good pizza; super yummy. EXCEPT for when my boyfriend threw up all night, and I had to rush him to the ER. We thought he had colitis... Until the next day when I threw up! I don't throw up and haven't since I was 8. So this made me feel the worst I've ever felt. My boyfriend's aunt also got sick. I read recent reviews that workers sneezed and made the pizza and such. If you're going to eat here, make sure you watch the people that make your pizza!\nTo be blunt, this is probably the most disgusting experience I've ever encountered."
"I had originally posted a 5-star review, but have now retracted it. While at The Brake Shop to have my brakes inspected, I also asked for an oil change and tire rotation. After they drained the oil, they realized they didnt have the proper oil filter, and could not locate one. They added some oil back in my 2012 Audi, and replaced the oil filter.\n\nWhen I went to Jiffy Lube the next day, the service guy there wouldn't touch it - there was oil all over the engine. I had to immediately go to the nearest Audi dealership, where they stated that either the oil filter was replaced improperly, or an incorrect oil filter was used. Had I driven any longer, this could have cause severe damage to my 1 yr old Audi.\n\n2 Stars because the store manager was very friendly, and didn't try to upsell me anything. Negative 3 stars for the poor garage staff."
"What an embarrassment! We took our friends from LA to this establishment for dinner on Saturday night. After a 50 minute wait, the dish I was craving, roasted pork chops, was no longer available. The drinks took over 15 minutes and the worst of it all, the place sold out of ALL desserts. How can you not have ANY desserts available on Saturday night at 10PM! Our waitress gave us every excuse possible why they were out of desserts, which made it that much more pathetic. We will not be back and St. Francis is fortunate they are in Phoenix, because this would never be tolerated in NY or LA."
"BlackFinn is like Buckhead Lite, if that makes sense. This place is literally like stepping into a good ol' boy frat house, maybe at Clemson or UNC. But as I've previously stated, this doesn't mean that the place isn't fun. It just means that you should know what you're getting yourself into when you head over there. Not a place to go for a casual drink, unless you're going midday or on a quieter night early in the week. \n\nLots of TVs in this huge bar, so it's a pretty decent place to watch a football or basketball game, especially since a lot of fans turn out here to check out their team. Located literally across the street from the Arena, it gets pretty packed before or after Bobcats games/concerts. It gets especially nuts on Friday and Saturdays, so be warned (or advised, if that's what you're looking to get into). \n\nThere's always a cover, which is a pain in the butt, but it's generally a good time if you're looking to really tie one on with friends."
"There was nothing I didn't like about the experience. We started our meal off with the bruschetta which was topped with delicious marinated tomatoes. Then I had the citrus marinated beet salad with goat cheese. Divine! Best salad that I have ever had! My partner had the radish cucumber salad which he said was a little plain (thus only 4 stars). Now for the incredible entrees... I had eggplant Parmesan which was simply incredible, it was served with a pasta which was a perfect balance of rich, creamy, garlicky. Yummy! My partner had the rigatoncini with Piemontese meat sauce and he said it was delicious! And to top it off, our drinks were perfectly made each time.  We didn't order any speciality cocktails but stuck with out favorites; a greyhound and Jack and Coke.\n\nOf course, I must mention the service... I was satisfied. Food came out at a nice pace and everybody was friendly and polite.\n\nI highly recommend this place especially if you're staying anywhere near Crystals high end shopping mall."
The employees here were extremely helpful and very nice. They helped me find exactly what I was looking for and very quickly at that. I definitely recommend this Ace for anything and everything you may need.
"What the heck happened here?  I have used this car wash for years and have, for the most part,  been happy with the service.   Today I visited and it was the WORST!  Although there was next to nobody there, I did not get checked in, however when someone pulled in behind me, they got served right away.  I had to get out of my car in order to get someone's attention.   When I walked into the store I was hit in the face with the overpowering smell of Pinesol.  Seriously, you can't clean BEFORE you open?  The car wash was mediocre at best.   Usually the place is packed on a Sunday.   Now I know why it's a ghost town."
"How's about a 30-minute hike to get away from the woes of the city? Exploration Park is a beautiful park for children and hiking spot for families of all ages to enjoy! At the halfway point, there is a small bench area where a breathtaking view of the Strip can be seen; or teenagers can venture up there to gossip about their high school lives without being overheard by other vicious gossip-mongers that you can find in school. \n\nAt the top of the peak, there is a circle terrace and another bench area where the view of the city is even more dazzling. The trail is a very small hike and really good for kids and beginners that want to step into the world of the outdoors. Make sure you can handle this small mountain before taking on bigger game ;) \n\nAt the bottom is a big play park for children with multiple swing sets and slides. They even designed it so it looks like the Ol' Vegas West!! It even has a tiny mountain replica that smaller kids can \""hike\"". It's just way too cute for words! \n\nSo how about a hike? Exercise, exercise, EXERCISE! Get those New Years Resolutions done while letting your kids play!!"
"Gotta give it a 4 since the pizza is pretty good, not the best, but the best you will find on East Sahara.  \n\nI have never dined in, and probably never will because the place always seems a little dead and the waitress/cashier/hostess/manger person is always having a spat with the cook.  I have picked up from here many times, there is always a different person running the show are that individual has never been very personable.\n\nThey do not deliver, so dine-in and carry-out are your only options.  Definitely call ahead and time your drive to arrive at the restaurant after your pizza is ready. Get your pizza and get out! That is my advice.\n\nThe pizza has been consistently good.  You won't be disappointed with the pie."
"I was in the mood for pizza and Amore served it up with great service.  I like this place and not just because I love Da' Bears!  The bread is baked fresh daily and plentiful, and I was able to order sausage and peppers as an appetizer.  As for the pizza I recommend the Margarita specialty pizza that comes on thin crust.  This is a casual place that does take time to prepare your food as everything is made fresh and to order, so for those that complain about the wait might want to bring better dining partners so the time can fly by as you wait.  I will come back as much as my diet allows, but it's worth every minute of extra time on the treadmill."
"THEhotel is THEmost elegant of all THEhotels on THEstrip. You don't feel like you're in Vegas when you're in THEhotel, with its lofty and airy but dark paneled walls, beautiful and simple bouquets of white flowers, and an excellent collection of art hanging on THEwalls (THElobby has pieces by Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Long, and Richard Serra). \n\nTHEsuites are spacious and THEbeds are comfortable. \n\nTHEswimming area includes a gigantic wave pool and a lazy river as well as a few other pools and hot tubs, with a \""beach\"" full of lounge chairs and cabanas that you can rent for $250 or more per day. THEbeach and pools were incredibly crowded, so we only stayed a short time. \n\nOne complaint - they charge for wifi, which in a hotel that expensive, you'd think it would just be included rather than nickel & diming you. \n\nAlso check out my review for miX, which is THEfancy restaurant in THEhotel, owned by celebrechef Alain Ducasse. It was nice but incredibly expensive. \n\nMy favorite thing about THEhotel - THEsticker that they leave on your toilet paper that says \""THEtp\""."
"Place has gone down hill.  Total tourist trap for deep wallets and/or suckers.  The ones in NY and Boston are fantastic.  To be fair, service was excellent.  That's about it.  Food was bland at best."
"Ehhhhhhh.\nOverhyped in my opinion. I've tried it a couple of times at a couple of different locations but came away with the same impression: burgers - nothing special, good but not great; shakes - same; fries - meh.\nI'll give it another shot the next time I'm in Scottsdale and try to remember to order off the \""secret\"" menu. Maybe that's where the really good stuff is."
Smelled like they wiped all their tables with dirty smelly rags... I can't eat in these conditions.
"UGH! Yesterday, I sent my boyfriend out to get us Roberto's because we just needed our rare fast food fix taken care of. I do not expect much of these places and I know it's not mamas home cooking, but this experience was dreadful, and we ordered to go!\n\nI ordered the beef chimichanga. It looked good from the outside. My boyfriend started saying how his chicken tacos tasted bland and way too greasy. I thought he was just being jaded, but once I started digging in to my plate, I noticed I've been eating tortilla and cheese, I thought that was strange so I began to dig in deeper, and sure enough, NO MEAT just about five layers of tortilla and SOME cheese. I was beyond livid and starving. My boyfriend was just as mad because he said that the guy taking the order was giving him such an attitude and didn't give him what he asked for (green/red salsa or limes.) My boyfriend drove all the way back to this location to demand another one prepared properly and sure enough with these dead beats, they accused him of eating all the meat. I'm sorry but why would he order something, only eat some of it, waste gas to drive back, ask for another one if we just wanted the meat? I want the entire thing and it became about the principle by then! Of course more attitude followed. Once he arrived back home, I opened my box and saw a bug WALKING ACROSS my damn chimichanga! I totally lost my appetite and just said forget it. NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS OR ANY LOCATION AGAIN. What happened to you, Roberto? We used to be like THIS! *Crossed my fingers gesture*\n\n\nEveryone who rated this place a four-five star, I hope you loved your nats as a garnish because I'm sure my plate wasn't the only one. YUM!"
The service is ok but the food is not worth it.  Found a 10 inch strand of hair in my food!! Gross
"What a disappointment.  Saw on facebook that their fall produce stand was now open.  Arrived to a few buckets of greens, one box of potatoes, pumpkins and jars of salsa, butters and a few other things.  No one so much as greeted us or tried to assist us.  We could not have purchased anything even if we had wanted to."
"We went to DW with friends for an early Valentine's day dinner. This was our first visit. My daughter recommended this place and we were not disappointed. It was so difficult to figure out what to order because everything sounded so good and looked so good going out!\n\nFirst I tried the strawberry infused rum which was delicious and not too sweet at all. I did also have the strawberry Caribbean mojito drink (can't remember what it is called). It was good but I thought it had too much mint and strawberry pulp.\n\nAt the table for appetizers we had jerk calamari (not what I expected, kind of sweet), flautas (excellent) and a chorizo and shrimp dish (also delicious).\n\nFor entrees I had the special which was a pan-fried skin-on snapper with coconut rice and mango salsa (out of this world), hubby had jerk lamb chops which he loved, most had the ox tails (got rave reviews as did the spicy mashed potatoes), shrimp scampi and chicken pasta. Not one bad review at all with entrees.\n\nWe shared a slice of carrot cake among the table and it was delicious. The server brought us a slice of the most chocolaty cake that I have ever had on the house as well.\n\nIt is a loooong way from our house but we will certainly go again. There are still things I want to try on the menu!"
"My friends and I really enjoyed our experience at Trump. I have always stayed at one of the hotels on the main part of the Strip, so at first I was a little wary of staying on the edge at Trump. I am SO glad that we did, though. Because Trump doesn't have a casino and is nonsmoking, the experience was just way more relaxed - and we were still able to go to other hotels for restaurants and clubs! The staff at Trump is excellent and everyone we interacted with was super professional, courteous and just plain friendly. The rooms are large and clean, and I absolutely adore the deep tubs in the bathrooms. We spent Saturday by the pool and reserved a cabana, something I highly recommend doing. The pool is low key but the music is great, and Sebastian (the person helping us) was the best! My only complaint is that the cabanas are poorly designed - the AC is positioned in such a way that it actually sends cold air OUT of the cabana instead of into it...weird. We also ate a lot of food at Trump, both in the restaurant area downstairs and through room service. Room service was AMAZING (get the onion rings!) - I highly recommend ordering in after a long night, they serve 24 hrs. The breakfast downstairs was stellar too - I loved the crab cake eggs benny. Overall this was just a great experience and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"
"By far, one of my favorite places to eat in the East Valley! The food is always delicious, and the veggies are so fresh! The milkshakes may be pricey but well worth it!"
"Hands down the best buffet in all of Vegas and I've been to them all countless times over the years.  The only other buffet that comes close is at the Bellagio, but the Wynn's is better.  Rio is great too, but the Wynn serves a considerably higher level of cuisine.\n\nNormal dinner is $35.95 and I saw that on Fri/Sat nights, dinner is $38.95.  I've had the dinner buffet here before and it was fantastic, but this time, I hit it for lunch and it was only $22.95.  The selection is not all that different from lunch to dinner and at that price, is just a few dollars more than a buffet at a place like Harrah's.  If you go for lunch, you can have the very best and it won't cost much at all, now that's true value.  Quality and selection-wise, there is just no comparison and with the exception of the Bellagio, nothing else comes close.\n\nI'm not even going to begin to describe all the incredible items that I saw and enjoyed.  One of my favorite regular items in their selection is the smoked salmon.  That's the first thing I go for every time.  Yikes, I must have eaten the price of admission in smoked salmon alone! :)  Even their dessert selection is downright astounding...all I can say is highly, highly recommended!\n\nIf you do only one buffet in Vegas, this is the one.  When I die, heaven better look like this!  Long live the king."
Really good food!  I was pleasantly surprised!  Do I have a rival to my coveted Thai Spices????  One more visit to decide!
"The first thing that struck us is how cocky this young waiter was.He was probably thinking \""WE AT SWAGAT ARE THE BOMB!!\"". Son, I just moved here from the San Francisco bay area.I know and cook Indian food and trust me you are NOT the bomb.Far from it.\nFood was OK.Nothing exceptional and definitely not what the reviewers here are going ga ga about but that is personal choice.We tried the chicken tikka and the vindaloo which was flavorful but definitely not worth the price we were paying. Quantities were not adequate for the amount we were paying.Is Indian food really that expensive here in Madison? The prices here are ridiculously overpriced for Indian food and every single Indian restaurant has the same price range for all dishes which would make me believe that they have some sort of Indian restaurant owners union that decides on what the prices are going to be!!\nAnother thing that irks me is the inclusion of south Indian food along with your Rogan Josh menu which raised a big flag for us regarding the quality of the food. No serious Indian restaurant owner would EVER include a idli sambar dosa on a menu that has Rogan Josh or biryani on it.PERIOD!\nJust looking at the quantity of dishes on the menu and we knew this was going to be your below average Indian fare.Definitely not coming back here.Unless of course the prices go down..way down."
"This place is now called Medley Buffet. Located inside Aliante Hotel and Casino, a locals casino, this small buffet can be found. The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of their \""Hawaiian\"" night every Tuesday. They have Hawaiian treats such as Kahlua pork, pineapple upside down cake, etc. \n\nBut the real highlight of Hawaiian night is their lechon...which would grab any Filipino's undivided attention! This was the only reason I went here on gym night. We got a table, grabbed a plate and looked for a big flock of Filipinos. If you see a big group of Filipinos in one spot, it's either they're gossiping about somebody or there's lechon in that spot! There's a reason why Anthony Bourdain calls lechon \""the best pork\"" he has ever eaten! I love pork too and I like cochinillo from Madrid and lechon from Cebu called Zubuchon. Lechon is normally served at an important event such as a wedding, graduation, baptism, family reunion (or whatever reunion) and birthdays. My excuse is it's still my birthday.\n\nSo we found the lechon...chopped up and ready for the pickins. Ooh, there were bottles of MANG TOMAS to dip your porky treat in. A testimony of legitness. I filled my first plate of just lechon: meat and crispy skin...and a spot for Mang Tomas. I don't eat rice because I'm a weird Asian. The meat was nice although there were some parts that were dry. Tip: for juicy pork, pick the part closest to the bone. If you want fatty, tender cuts, get the belly...the only down side to that is you could be crunching on pig nipples. But whatever. Eat the skin while it's still hot. I know most of us like taking lots of pictures of what we're about to eat so we have something to post on Yelp and social media websites...you're putting yourself at great risk of stabbing/cutting your gums if the once crispy pork skin gets cold. Lechon doesn't let you mess around! It's serious business. The only fine detail they forgot was the apple inside the pig's mouth.\n\nThey have the usual buffet desserts: pies, cakes, gelato, frozen yogurt/ soft-served ice cream, fruits, etc. i like the frozen yogurt and spumoni gelato. I tried the pineapple upside down cake which was more muffin than it was cake. But I still liked it.\n\nSo yeah, LECHON TUESDAYS!!! Hoy! For only $20 you can eat as much lechon your arteries would allow you to eat before clogging up and if you/ your tito/tita, ate/kuya have/has an Aliante players card, it's only $15/person! Compare the savings if you got your own lechon for $100-200 depending on the size of the pig because nobody in town will sell lechon in small portions - you get the whole pig or none at all."
"Stacy's Smokehouse came recomended and it lived up to thier words.  Nicole at the front was friendly and helpful with making the correct choices...go big, because you'll come back for more if you don't.  The onion rings and bbq pork sandwich were delicous and I'll be looking to come back again soon."
"Scam. For profit, non accredited scam school. You are better off spending $90.000.00 on mega bucks."
"There are much better places to stay in the Marriott family. Skip this place.\nDirty towels, pool under renovation (which no one told us about ahead of time), lots of broken down things in the room, inconsistent stories from the managers (Grace & Saul - have they even had any sort of training??).  There's absolutely no level of security either. No card scan to operate elevator - seemingly anyone could walk in off the street and have access to all floors. \n\nRenaissance Hotels come with the reputation of a  certain level of service, and this place is a miss on all levels. There are so many better options within a short walking distance of the convention center. Save yourself the hassle and stay there."
"They charged $110 to tell me that my gas cap wasn't screwed on tightly. After my furious husband told them that we would obviously not be back, the manager told us that was fine, and proceeded to flip my husband off as we drove out. Nice customer service. \n\nJust for the record, we went there about a year prior to this service call for new brakes and spent about $400. The team back then was completely different and had great customer service which is why we went back in the first place. \n\nDon't go there."
"Love this place. Love it.\n\nLove the view of Princes Street, the Scots Monument, Waverley, the Balmoral and the Gardens. Love the quotations engraved on the paving stones. Love the artwork on the walls. Love the blink-and-you'll-miss-it Writer's Museum. Love the way it cuts itself off from the city in the space of a half dozen steps. Love the network of closes, and terraces that overhang and wind off it, reminding me of a hundred years ago. Reminding me of Labyrinth. Love David Bowie. Love the inspiration. Love the real taste of Oldtown.\n\nLove it."
"I had bought a Halloween costume on clearance the previous year, and they didn't take the little plastic thingy off my costume, and I didn't realize it til a year later when I went to put on my Halloween costume and felt the plastic thing. I went back there, (of course, i didn't have the receipt, but the clearance sticker was still there), so I explained that i had bought the costume last year bla bla bla, and that they never took off the thing, The lady started arguing with me that she couldn't just take it off cuz i \""could have just stole it from there that day\""... really lady? Look at all your costume currently in your store, you don't sell this costume this year! I asked to speak to a manager and she says \""I am the manager\"". So i asked her if I could pay for it again for her to take it off... she agrees... so shes trying to figure out how to ring it up, and couldn't figure it out... then she says 'hold on, I'm gonna get the manager'... Uhm what?! I thought she was the manager? so she gets the manager and the manager just tells her \""take it off, we don't sell the costume anymore, there's no reason to make her pay for it again\"" the girl just stood there like \""really? but but but...\"" the manager was like \""just take it off, give it to her.\"" So I politely thank the manager as the other girl takes the plastic thing off, then I couldn't help but say \""I thought you said you WERE the manager!?\"" and she says \""well, i'm the assistant manager\"" I haven't been there since. What a joke!"
Just nothing good to say. Grilled salmon and grilled veggies swimming in oil and the salmon was burnt. Server never ask if ever how it was. I guess I shouldn't leave out that the rice tasted like it had been sitting around in a warmer for days.
"TEXT MESSAGING\nMe:  \""Wanna go First Friday at Beauty Bar?\""\nCousins:  \""I'm down, what time?\""\nMe:  \""Let's meet at my house by 10:30pm\""\nCousins:  \""Okay... what do I wear?\""\nMe:  \""It's all casual and chill.  Just come as you are\"".\n\nEver wanted to go somewhere where you don't have to worry about looking cute or packing on the foundation and blow-drying your hair?  Sometimes it gets annoying getting ready for over an hour, smelling good only to come out the total opposite.  Not Beauty Bar... no, no, no.  I love the fact that I can wear jeans, a baby-t, pull my hair in piggy-tails with a puma hat over it, tennis shoes, eye-liner and lip gloss, and I'm all set to party and chill.  \n\nWhen my cousins and I arrived, there was already a line where people were waiting to be let in.  Luckily, the line wasn't unbearable and only waited for about a good 10 minutes before entering.  I knew the bouncer since I found this place through my old work promoting and marketing Kool cigarettes, and he was always friendly with us.  I was about to just walk right in since that's what I was used to, but I was abruptly stopped by the cashier.  \""Five dollars, please.\""  Damn!  First time I've had to pay to get in.  At least it's only a $5 and not $20 or more.  Can't complain.  Maybe if I wore a skirt and she was a lesbian, she would've let me in after a cute smile at her.  For guys, it's $10.  So be ready to have cash at hand.  Otherwise,  you'll have to go to the ATM and it's a waste of a walk just for small bills.\n\nIt was a crowded scene, people with drinks in their hand and/or waiting to get a drink at the bar.  At times, there are people who do art off to the side and a lady who will give you a manicure.  Never seen anything like it.  I liked the originality of it.  Mostly, it's like a lounge without any seats on the inside.  After walking deeper inside the club, there you're lead to a small dance floor and the music is like techno/dance.  That's where the bathrooms are too.  I'd hate to dance where I can smell people's shit and puke.\n\nFurther down, you'll hit the door that leads to the outside.  This is where all the b-boys and b-girls are doing their thing. The music is underground hip-hop.  Don't come here if you want 50Cent or Justin Timberlake.  Commercial HipHop is not welcome.  If it's a good crowd, it's a great night.  But this night, my cousins and I were bored.  There wasn't much happening and all the seats were pretty much taken.  So, we were just standing around.  I needed to get sloshed if it was gonna be like this the whole night.  Drinks are $5 a glass of anything.  I loved that!  Since I was a light weight, I got tipsy with $15.    Woohoo, what a cheap drunk I was.  We finally got a couch to sit on so we raced for it.  I was starting to have fun until I felt like I had to entertain someone the whole night.  That was my exit.  We stayed a good 2 hours and left.  \n\nI love First Friday.  I'd go back just so I can try to dance if there were anyone else dancing.  I guess I'd be like a karaoke dancer - I'd have to be wasted to feel comfortable on the dance floor."
"When it's a Tuesday night, and Cadillac Ranch is in dive-bar mode, I like it a lot. Chill music, nice patio, great specials on beer. Since the bar was outdoors, my pals didn't have wander off to have a smoke.\n\nWeeknight specials are awesome. $3 pints of some good stuff like Mission Blonde Ale. I can relax here, and the interior looks so nice I'll definitely come back during peak hours. I'm a fan."
"Pros : clean place\nCons: lots. The service was horrible, especially when you are paying pretty high for the food and drinks. Cocktail Drinks cost about $10 and entries average about $16-$24. And when you get bad service for spending so much, that would drive me crazy. \n\nDrinks and food were ok. Not the quality I expected. There r lots of other restaurants on mill ave that are far better.\n\nIn short, I personally would not recommend this place to any of my friends n relatives."
"I get it. I understand the premise. At first it was cute and funny and amusing, but when you place a hat on my 13 YEAR OLD daughters head that says \""I'm the load my mom should have swallowed\""............. i looked at the list of things that you say you are NOT and i realized you covered all those bases.\nSo if you're looking for a place with uncomfortable seating and mediocre overpriced food. This is it."
"It can be a long wait sometimes, but they are able to text you when your table is ready. Warning though, they will only hold your table for 5 minutes. This place is really famous for their Frozen Hot Chocolate. I've tried their coffee flavored and i have to say it was pretty good. The prices can be a bit high, but you are in Las Vegas so it'll always be high (think of how much the Starbucks is across the street). I got their grilled cheese with tomato soup and that was delicious. So was their chicken strips, but when you think about it, you can probably get that somewhere else for a cheaper price. It's the ambience, location, and that frozen hot chocolate that you're kind of paying for. I recommend that you have a Total Rewards card because there is a discount for that. Enjoy the that Frozen Hot Chocolate!!!"
"Update: As of 9 June, Memphis Best is only open Thursday-Saturday, 1100-2000. Gunny says they're shifting their emphasis to catering over the summer. Whether he'll go back to Mon-Sat in the fall remains to be seen."
"I've been eating here since I was a kid and it was on 10th street. In fact, I used to live behind them and be tortured by the smells. When I used to travel with my boss, we would just order a bunch of falafel wraps to go from the woman that used to answer the phone by yelling, \""KASSAB!\"" Awesome roadtrip food. \n\nNow, more often, I get the portabella wrap. It's messy, but worth it and you can just eat the last few bits with a fork. Great pickled veggies and hummus.\n\nIt's gone more upscale since the old days, but also pricier. Oh well, glad they can survive the rents on Carson."
"Gluten free and whatever, typical over priced Las Vegas restaurant with subpar food. One dish was so bad we had to send it back and the menu outside the restaurant wasn't even the current menu. I try to order things that are naturally gluten free in a normal manner without asking if it's gluten free. I have severe gluten allergies that make me deathly ill and I didn't have any issues eating here other than the food not bring that great."
"Since Im big into breakfast foods, Im always on the look out for a new place.. and whadda ya know. .I found \""The Place\""  How convieeeeent.. \n\nI read the reviews and when asking a few people on Facebook about it, I heard nothing good good responses, so why not give it a shot.  I heard that you have to be early or it gets insane.  We showed up about 9AM and waited for maybe 5min.  Not too bad. \n\nThe menu looked incredible and as I watched the servers take food to the tables, I could see that the amounts of food give were enormous.  I couldn't wait.  Checking the reviews on Yelp, I ordered a chorizo omelet with avocado, and all the fixens.  I thought I'd love it, but I think I was more overwhelmed with spice than anything. and I love spicy food.. what gives?  \n\nThe second time we all went, we got there at 8AM and sat right away.. this time I was told to order biscuits and gravy..  Damn were they good.  I got an order of those along with a huge pancake.   Here's what I loved about their pancakes.. they tasted home cooked.  Like when your mom takes out the old griddle that still has last weeks charred food on it,  yet still cooks on it, and it has that home yummy taste? Yep.. that's their pancakes.   Downed that with some iced tea and it was one awesome breakfast.  \n\nIve been here three times now in two months... I think Im hooked."
"This is my favorite spa in Las Vegas. I enjoy the fact that women and men are separated. I feel completely at ease and relaxed. After a long week I try to come here as often as I can to rejuvenate myself. Facial and mudd bath are a must! Amazing! I get a body mask and a hair mask and wear it for half an hour in the steam room and I feel like a new woman every time I leave this place. I will always come back here for my spa treatments, love it!"
"Awesome place to go for Poutine. Eat in or Take out! There's a nice park down the street where you can take your poutine and have a picnic by the lake.\n\n I'm from Vancouver where poutine is simply cheese curd and gravy on fries. When I came to Quebec, the birthplace of Poutine, I had to try what has been immortalized into French-Canadian pop culture.\n\nThey have a long list of different kinds of toppings.  You can choose ones with beef, chicken, bacon, hot dog wiener, or even vegetarian.  The presentation would not win any awards for \""plating\"", but then this is a comfort food, and what more comforting than your favourite topping on fries.\n\nWe had La Bacon, La Taquies (sour cream, tomatoes and guacamole) and the Special of the day (Turkey with onions).  Our favourite was La Bacon.\n\nSo good, So filling, So worth the visit."
The duck fat fried French fries come out to start and you know you're in a good place. We tried a few things off the main menu but the Rib cap is seriously the best thing I've ever had.
The service is not that good and the food is also not that great
"My husband and I went to Vegas for his birthday in the beginning of March and we stayed at Paris for the first time. We were excited to be staying there for the first time, especially since it had been given four stars.\n\nWhen we walked into the hotel I was pretty impressed with what I saw. It seemed very nice and I liked how everything was designed to be like you're walking outside in Paris. When we walked into our room though, I was somewhat disappointed. For the price we were paying it wasn't as nice as what I was expecting, or what I'm used to. Everything seemed old and a little dingy. The bathroom was the nicest part of the room. Now, I know that most people think, \""Well, the room doesn't matter that much because I'm only going to be in it a few hours to sleep.\"" I agree with this to a point. When I'm in Vegas I'm away from my kids so I stay out later than normal, so I usually catch a little nap in the afternoon before going out again at night. So I do spend a little more time in my hotel room than most people maybe. \n\nAnother turn off, our room smelled like sewer! It was disgusting! I mean, how am I supposed to rest up for another wild night when I'm trying not to gag?! It was gross.\n\nAfter being out and about during the day, we would always come back to a clean room. However, one morning while getting out of the shower I reached for towel only to open it and find that it was DIRTY! Also, we left our room on Sunday morning and the hall was littered with room service trays, glasses and beer bottles. No big deal as long as it gets cleaned up, right? No one cleaned it up until Monday afternoon!\n\nOverall, we were disappointed. Not very clean, and it stunk! We won't be staying there again.The valet service, however, was good"
"So this is what fatherhood has come to.  I haven't been out to eat since my son was born.  Craving an opportunity to write another review on Yelp, I'm stuck reviewing my last oil change.\n\nI went in, the place was dead.  The guy told me there was a 90 minute wait (not to mention it's a first come first serve establishment)  He said it would be best if I come back.\n\nGo back 90 minutes.  No one around.  The guy says it's going to be a 30 minute wait till they can look at my car.  I say I'll wait.  40 minutes later and my car is still sitting where I parked it.  I get frustrated and leave.  \n\nTwo days later, I arrive right when they open.  This time NO people and NO cars.  It still takes them 45 minutes to do a basic oil change.  \n\nI may be Jewish and the phrase \""get the car serviced\"" is a childhood slogan in my family, but even I can change the oil quicker with no tools than these putz's!  Even though I had a $10 off coupon the hours I spent waiting for them to do the job is not worth it.\n\nDon't bother."
"Being from Texas, I am a fan of Tex-Mex which believe it or not, is hard to find in these parts.  Although not Tex-Mex, I had high hopes for Los Dos because of the rave reviews of my husband's friends and family.  Everyone was promising me this would be a break from the disappointing Mexican food I had tried in the valley.  So, off we go...and what a let down.  The food was okay, but definitely not all it was hyped up to be.  I love mouth scorching spicy food but you get the impression that the dishes have no flavor because of the overwhelming spicy flavor is all you can taste.  The service was virtually non-existant and we got the impression that we were a burden to the waitstaff by dining there.  So, the search continues..."
So disappointed.  My husband and I decided to have a little stay-cation because I am 8 months pregnant with twins.  Upon a riving to the hotel we were under the impression we would be greeted by vallet. Surely one of the great hilton hotels would have someone to park cars on a busy Saturday afternoon.  NO there was no one outside. Secondly the front desk gal was very friendly.  Good greeting she educated me on the package my husband had bought as I checked us in while he was parking the car. After I checkled in  I looked for someone to help me with our bags. Again no one there to help. So With a luggage cart in hand I found the elivator....ok so now you are telling me there is not even someone to help me get this thing to the 8th floor . When I got to the room they key card  that i was given didn't even unlock the door. So that meant toting the same bulky luggage cart back to the elevator back down stairs though the lobby. While 8 months pregnant mind u. I had it. I called my husband he came up to the room and went down stairs to get a new card. I checked out the room nothing extraordinary.  But I was jus ready to relax except I found old french fries in the couch and a dead fly on the bed....we will not be returning to the hilton.  For 200$. This has been a craptastic experience.  I really wish I had jus booked a room at the Sheraton or the local holiday inn.
"Food is not anything special and hibachi is way overpriced. While dining an ant crawled off my sisters plate and when we told them about it they made it seem like we were making it up, however later on in the night more ants appeared on our table and when we told the sever she wiped the table down with a dish rag and went on with no care. For a meal that was over $150 I expected better service and a much cleaner atmosphere. If you're thinking of coming here maybe try Ohjah instead; cleaner atmosphere, tastier food, fresher sushi, and much better customer service."
"Boss:  \""You want to go to a conference in Montreal?\""\n\nMe:  \""Umm, hell yea, I heard there is good food up there!\""\n\nThis place had a line when I got there for lunch on a weekday.  The wait was not that bad, but man it was worth it.  I ordered the smoked meat with...LOTS OF FAT!  Of course, fat = flavor...right?  Well, it was pretty damn good.  I mean, it didn't change my life or anything, but if I lived here, I would probably hit this place up at least once a month.  Cheap, delicious smoked meats.  Sit down, order and make yourself a sandwich."
"Yesterday, for the second time, I hiked up Siphon's Draw and today, for the second time, I can barely walk.  This is a tough one!  Like Natalie W stated, it does start out pretty easy but gets steeper and requires some tricky hand and feet placement.  There isn't a clear trail to the top and it isn't highly populated, so make sure you follow the white and blue spray painted dots.  For you Camelback hikers, it's about twice the distance - it took the bf and I about an hour and 45 minutes to get to the summit, and this is with continuous hiking with maybe a 2 minute stop for water.  \n\nThe view is definitely worth it!  Make sure you take lots of water and a snack or two for the top!"
"Worst service EVER! We sat down at a dirty table (because all the tables were dirty) around 12:15 pm. We ordered margaritas on the rocks WITH salt. We got no salt so we waited another 5-10 mins for our salted margs. Then we waited for our order to be taken for about another 10-15 mins while our server was standing next to the kitchen. Well, we ordered and it was NOW 1:57pm and our food was still not to our table. One of us had ordered nachos and at 1:57 they came to tell us they were out of tortilla chips! Are you joking???? That's something they should have known from first hand! I will NEVER go back! I've worked in restaurants since I was 15 and I've never seen any sort of thing like this before! We were not the only table waiting for our food that long either....."
"Dang I love Tempe Marketplace. They have it all, a huge plethora of stores to choose from for your every need. The place is kept clean, they always have visible security and there aren't ever a bunch of homeless kids running around being ab noxious. From the upscale steakhouse to the pottery painting store, I love Tempe Marketplace."
"I used to LOVE this place a couple years ago. My friend wanted to try it & I was down, considering I really enjoyed their crepes. \n\nOrdered the Nutella crepe w/ banana (extra $2.00). It was good, but not as good as I remembered. Maybe not worth my $10 anymore, which totally sucks. It didn't seem like there was a whole banana in there either, ugh. \n\nNot sure if I'll be back here again. It kinda lost its edge in my book. I'd rather use my $10 somewhere else."
"Right on Duquesne's campus and a perfect place to go before a concert or Pens game at the Consol Energy Center.  It can get crowded before games/concerts so make sure to leave plenty of time. The bar is also fun to hang out at as they have great game day drink specials.  I ordered the 2nd Shift pale ale for the $3 special-the bartenders said it tasted just like Yuengling which it did.  For dinner I went with the cobb wrap which was a cobb salad (egg, cheese, chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, bacon) in a wrap. The hot bacon dressing was delicious. My date ordered the turkey club with homemade chips which he too enjoyed. My only complaint is that I ordered mashed potatoes as my side instead of fries and they charged me $1.99 extra."
"I know and love L.A area pastrami and this place is ok for the high prices. The over price burgers are ok.  They have coke products advertised on menu but only carry Pepsi products. I will not be returning, I will save my cravings for when I go visit L.A"
"This is the only fast food restaurant I eat at.  I usually come here if I need a quick fix.  That fix usually comes after the gym, when there is no food at home.  You can't go wrong here.  The burgers are great.  I always get a triple meat burger with grilled onions.  2 of them.  The young kids they got working here are are always polite, quick, professional, AND they can speak english.  I find this to be the case in the California locations as well.  They must have a great training program."
"I've been reading some of the other reviews and I honestly don't understand why people don't like this place. Maybe my experience was just different. (I went here for a private event with open bar on a Sat night from 8-10pm) but my whole group had an AMAZING time. (That could also be the multiple free drinks we all had) but in either case, I would definitely recommend this place to others. It's much more mellow than the other clubs and you can actually move around without being elbowed and jostled and groped everywhere you turn. You definitely have to check out the outside lounge because it's phenomenal. The music out there is different than the music they play inside but it's still really good. And the view is wonderful. As the night progresses, they bring a live band into the indoor lounge and the band plays cover songs all night long. The drinks are good and they're made strong and there's a lot of fun flare bartending you can watch while they make your drinks. I had so much fun that we managed to stay at this place for 4-5 hours and didn't even realize it until I started to get tired."
"The moment I saw this food shop, I immediately thought of the movie Ms. Doubtfire, and felt this must be the kind of store to get food one pretends to have cooked! Everyone's happy and none the wiser.\n\nIt's the only store of its kind I've seen in Edinburgh, and I'm not surprised it's located in Bruntsfield! A La Carte prepares meals, which the customer buys frozen and the menu is really quite extensive. They do soups, poultry, pork, meat and vegetarian dishes as well as desserts, and whilst there are some fancy meals such as fruity moroccan lamb and leek filo tarts, a lot of the dishes are surprisingly simple and homey. Macaroni and cheese, shepherd's pie and meatballs and spaghetti are on the menu and capture the spirit of what most of the other dishes are like. I would personally make a lot of these meals myself rather than pay for them, but I guess some people go for this sort of thing.\nWhat excites me more about A La Carte are their baked goods, which are fresh each day! They do scones, cakes, bread etc, which I'm more than happy to buy."
"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....\n\nLast year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  \""You can't do that.\""  \""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling.\"" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  \""The owners don't allow it.\""  \""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.\""  \""No.  You'll have to put it away.\""\n\nNow.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  \n\nA couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    \n\nI'd kind of like the \""Restaurant Impossible\"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."
"Seriously - more than one entrance would be nice.....y'know, like one that didn't require me parking in the middle of the parking lot and then walking around 10+ stores and restaurants in the 100+ degree sun simply to get to the entrance.\n\nThat said, overall a very nice theater once you get inside, and with an IMAX to boot I'm sure I'll be back regardless of how assinine the process of getting inside is."
"The smell of this place is very strong ( in a bad way )  when you step foot in it. \nI understand they have alot of items you may not find in a traditional store, but I dont care. I couldnt get past the front of the store to check it out. I respect that the seafood and other items are supposed to be \""fresh\"" but I amot the first person to have this feeling about the place. I go to other stores that are international stores , carry meats and seafoods and they dont smell anything like this."
The food isn't to bad.  Its a great local bar.  Very friendly and great bartenders.
"The location is perfect, next doors to our dentist... and I think their chicken is awesome... the Spicy Honey Mustard and Asiago Parmesan... also MUST TRY.... their homemade Asiago Chips... nice!!!"
"I've given this place a try several times, but I just can't seem to get a good meal out of there. I had their alfredo pasta and it had absolutely no flavor at all. It just lacks flavor, everything I order I feel like going back into the kitchen to add a little seasoning. There are plenty little Greek places around that serves up good home made food and for alot less $$ too, I wouldn't bother with this place again."
"I stayed here Thanksgiving weekend, and all I can say is that MC is an absolutely disgusting establishment.\n\nGranted, MC is your more economical choice for staying on the Strip. I wasn't expecting anything extravagant, but after my experience here I would have gladly put down the $30 extra a night to stay at a decent hotel.  My terrible visit began with the hour-long wait to check in.  I know Thanksgiving weekend is mega busy for Vegas, but come on.  When I finally made it to the check-in desk, I was informed the room I booked was unavailable, and was assigned one equipped with handicap facilities. No big deal.  That is, until I got up to the room, pulled back the comforter, and discovered a pool of BLOOD on the the sheets! It was everywhere and so horrifically disgusting!! \n\nI immediately when back down to complain, where I had to wait another hour just to talk to someone.  When I finally did get a hold of a person, they were only willing to change out the sheets.  Uh, hell and no on that! My God, there was BLOOD on that freaking bed!  The MC staff acted like I was complaining about a full trash can or something!  \n\n I demanded a room change, even though they kept insisting there weren't any available rooms.  They kept giving off this whole, \""What's the big deal?\"" attitude to the whole situation, which I was not having. Finally, after asking for a refund, they offered to upgrade my room for free.  The new room was decent, (of course though, the bathroom lights didn't work and we had to call and have them replaced) in that there did not appear to be blood on the bed, and since I had already wasted my whole day dealing with the MC staff I took it to try and salvage some vacation time.\n\nNaturally, at check-out they tried charging me for the upgrade.  Dealing with MC was a nightmare.  I strongly urge others to avoid this place.  Overall, you really don't save that much compared with other hotels.   Save your time and sanity and go somewhere sanitary."
"Pitbull Pest Control got rid of things that crawl in the night successfully for us, without all of the usual poison.  This company has organic safe insecticide solutions which are much safer than the regular poison most exterminators use.  We find it reassuring as pet owners, to know that our pets are exposed to less poison... as exterminating is a necessity in Las Vegas."
"You definitely haven't experienced Vegas to the fullest if you leave without seeing Cirque du Soleil's O show!!! I got lucky during my visits cus my parent's were able to get me complimentary tickets not once but twice to experience this breath taking, phenomenal show. I'd seriously pay if i had to cus it is seriously just... O-mazing. O-tastic. Ridiculous! If you're a Cirque fan, this is a must. I'm not going to go into any details but throughout the show, there's so much going on! Just how I like it, everything felt so spontaneous and even overwhelming (cus so much was going on at once) but it was seriously... elaborately and beautifully put together.\n\nMy first experience there, we sat in the very front row and we definitely got a bit wet... but i didnt care cus the show seriously just kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole night! (show lasted about ... less than 2 hours) but second time around... lesson learned. If you sit behind row D... you'll be safe and dry and the experience is just as spectacular! I definitely want to experience the show from the balcony seats one day though (FYI: heard it's actually less expensive AND you get the whole view of the stage!!!).\n\nSeriously, do yourself the most memorable favor by treating yourself to enjoy this show. warning: it will sweep you off your feet =)"
From being greeted at the door by the owner to the kind and gentle attention one seated the experience and ambiance matched the excellent quality ingredients of the food.  Great value for the money.  Recommend come early evening or very late night.  The place is packed with locals and tourist.
"This is like a more expensive, less tasty version of Macayos. \n\nI went here with a group of about nine people, and even though six of the nine people were present, they didn't seat us until everyone was present.  Hmm, ok.  This was on a quiet Monday evening.\n\nWe're seated and I will give credit to the server as she was very pleasant and attentive.  There was rarely a time a beverage glass was empty. \n\nThe food leaves a lot to be desired.  I had the carne asada taco plate with a side of guacamole.  It was as if nothing had any seasoning.  I understand Americanized Mexican food, I really do, and I did not go in here with the expectation of getting super-flavorful food, but I did expect some seasoning.  \n\nI definitely won't choose to come back here."
Never disappoints!
"I know it is a McDonald's. I get it. But as far as a fast food chain goes, this particualr McDonald's has my loyalty. \n\nTalk about your fast friendly service. Whether I am ordering just coffee or a couple hash browns for my boy and I on the way into school I know I will be through the drive-thru in 5 minutes tops!"
"Finally got something I've never had at this place: Good service....obviously a Phoenix landmark that should be visited by all at least once, but new location loses some of the old charm.  Limited menu, but pretty good...expect a long line..."
"Located in the Arroyo shopping complex, close to Chipotle this is the place I've been going to to get my eyes checked for the past couple years. The doctor is cool, friendly, and never rushes through the exam. He takes the time to explain things and answer any questions. The rest of the staff is friendly and very helpful. They'll help you find the perfect set of new frames and their selection is fairly extensive. A lot of designer brands and plenty of affordable ones too. Their prices are comparable to other optometrists I've been to. They're also good with kids, so you can bring the whole family down here to get everyone's eyes checked out."
"The first room they gave us was dirty and when I came back down to tell them, they informed me that there were no non smoking rooms left but then they said they had one left.  A King size bed which wasn't the great since it was for my Dad and myself but we were too tired to wait for the maid to clean the other room. The maid service was awful once we were there. On the first morning, we had a \""please make up our room\"" sign up from 9am until 3pm and when we got back, they still hadn't made it up!  No free breakfast but you do get a $10 credit which doesn't cover much. Staff friendly but I wouldn't go back."
"okay, i want to start by saying that i was dressed like a champ and had no money. my two friends however, had a couple dozen K  on them and were dressed \""okay\"". we were treated like shit almost everywhere we went in this casino because of that. Michael Mina was an outstanding place though. if you're hungry and love wine, go there!"
"Food was decent, but the manager on duty was super shady. First, no service, we didn't get napkins or water until 20 mins later when we asked for it. At the end, I paid with cash, and waited for change, but there was less $10 bill when the manager gave us the change. When we confronted him about it, he said there might've been a mistake and he corrected it. This is just not right, some shady things going on! It is unacceptable for a restaurant to not give the right amount of change, and it seems like this manager was trying to do it on purpose!"
"I had my hair cut by Mariana and she did a great job.  I have extremely fine hair and she did her best to give it some life.  She listened to me talk about what I was trying to achieve longer than any stylist ever has.  She also gave me some good tips as she was styling.  She was very nice, talkative and happy so it made for a good experience.  Plus it didn't break the bank.  I already booked my next appointment!"
"This nail salon, which used to be a nice neighborhood shop, has fallen.  On a day I was pressed for time, I made an appointment.  After waiting \""just a minute\"" for 20 minutes, then using the dirty restroom, and being told \""2 more minutes,\"" I decided to take my business elsewhere.  I will not be returning."
For the price and location  not a bad value. But I wouldn't stay here again. I saw check-in lines go well over an hour during my stay. It looked like the airport TSA line on a bad day. Just wouldn't be worth it to start a weekend with that experience.
"I LOVE THE Pink Spot!  \nIT is so cute inside and smells soooooo good! the staff is ALWAYS nice! The ice cream is to die for, where else can you get a home made ice cream taco or cookie sandwich, chocolate covered bannana, and bond bonds.... Last night I had my first European Sunday! YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM"
"To my surprise, it was the buffet that I liked the least. The quality of food was not there. The food was presented in a way it didn't make me want to eat it but I gave it a try anyway since I was already there and had paid for it. A lot of the food that I tried didn't taste good and it tasted more like canned or frozen food. The place smelled bad, not a inviting scent for sure and was not very clean. Even the dishes were dirty, the waiter had a hard time finding me a clean fork that wasn't stained with residues. What a shame."
"Good time, really good food.  Nice view of the strip."
"My team and I were trolling the strip looking for a place to eat. We decided that a burger would be simple and ideal. We found this French themed burger place inside of the Paris hotel and thought it should be good.\n When we walked up to the doors, we were greeted by a couple of hostesses that were way too ugly to have such a shitty, snooty attitude. They barely acknowledged us and just pointed inside to the bar and said \""seat yourselves\""\n We were too hungry to care so we sat down at the bar and the bartender just seemed tired, overworked and didnt really care about the people. To him, we were just another party crew passing through Las Vegas.\n He handed us all dirty, sticky greasy menus and disappeared for 10 minutes.\nWe finally gave him our drink orders and he was snappy with his response and seemed so annoyed by us, the people who tip. \n When I ordered my Guinness, he just poured it in the pint, one pour and let it sit and settle by itself. Any self respecting bartender would NEVER pour a pint of Guinness so poorly. If I were a manager or the establishments owner, I would give him his walking papers just for his lack of respect to Guinness and the art of the \""Perfect Pour.\"" I let that slide in hopes that the food would be great.\n  \nI ordered the Blue Cheese burger and when it finally came out, I sank my teeth into it and, while it was a tasty burger, it was without a doubt the greasiest thing I have eaten in very long time. \n It had disrupted my stomach that I could not even eat it anymore. It was heavier by the grease and not by the meat. Huge bun designed to fill you up and distract you from the fact that youre eating a greasy pile of beef in a huge doughy bun.\n  I perhaps wouldnt have been so disappointed by this if the $15 burger at least came with french fries, but I left with a stomach ache and never a desire to return.\n\nI would never recommend this place. If you want to eat a burger. Do NOT go here.\nThere is a Fatburger right down the strip and is worth the extra time/distance walking."
"Did not want to give one star. Horrible service, grouchy servers..... Worst service ive ever had. Do your family a favor.... Don't eat at golden china..... Especially if your Hispanic"
"We went on Friday night to Don and Charlie's with some friends.  We didn't have a reservation so the wait was quite long, which really wasen't a big deal because I knew the wait would be long.\n\nThe owner saw that we we had been waiting so he found a table for us.\nThe problem was the waitress was quite busy and when we ordered our food she assumed that we would be sharing so she had everything split.  We asked numerous times for ketchup and she kept forgetting.  \nThe biggest problem I had was that I ordered ribs.  They were so dry that I had to pour lots of sauce over them.  Earlier that night the ASU football team was there, I think they cooked a ton of ribs and had extras that they didn't use, so then they served those to us.  They were the worst ribs I have ever had!\n\nI do love the decor and maybe the food would be better at another time."
"Good service, tasty food. However, I have never been to Tibet so I can't compare it to the authentic one."
"We went there for my friend's birthday tonight. It's my first time giving a reataurant a 1star. The food was over salty, however, that was not the worst part. The service is the worst in my life. The waitress kept giving us nasty looks and horrible attitudes, she yelled at at one of us for forgetting to sign the receipt. The waiter,waitress or even the boss were talking about us in korean. Maybe they thought we cannot see them pointing and laughing at us. At last, the waitress dropped the bill in front of us when we ate for only 15minutes. That was the worst experience in my life and i will never go there again. NOT Recommended!"
Having the Chicken Parmesan tonight. Very good as far as coffee shops go. Service was pretty good. Very busy tonight.
"I normally don't like to rag on a place but have been coming here for a while because the food is excellent. Excellent. But, the service has been consistently worse and worse. I'm not one to rag on a family place for bad service -- normally I'm not expecting super fast highway food. But, this place is getting to the point of ridiculous. Took us an hour and a half for dinner the other night. Not terribly busy. One server who was friendly and one busser who was doing... what? We couldn't figure out. Also, as one commentor noted, they'll let the phone ring and ring and ring without picking it up if too busy. Drove my boyfriend nuts and definitely made for a less than stellar meal. \n\nWill we be back again? Likely. The food is fantastic. But we'll probably only go when we have an hour+ to spare."
"Ambiance is amazing....very Zen, without being too Zen-y.  The massage rooms are bliss, iPods with playlists to be chosen by the client, something gorgeous to look at (flowers on the floor) and scented (or un-scented) oils that are so beautifully fragrant.  The staff is exceptionally kind.  Lockers area is complete - could leave for office right after a treatment.  Good for solo spa-goer....areas set up for solitude and the atmosphere encourages quiet.  Divine."
"Jamba Juice. Here is a company whose stock cost me a pretty penny on the market a couple years ago.  Even though this company stock burned me I still come in from time to time to relive the glory days when Jamba was opening up a few new stores around the country every week. The menu has gotten a whole lot bigger since then but it was nice to see they still have a lot of the classics. I found it interesting how similar some of the smoothies taste from menu to menu, but as the prices went up the ingredients became much healthier. I wish I could remember the two smoothies that I am referring to specifically but oh well...\n\nI am giving this Jamba Juice two stars because it is a great representation of why this company will never be great. There is a huge lack in management here. The employees are all super causal and in no way embody Jamba Juice's company character of being a healthy, intelligent and delicious choice. In my experience the employees here have not necessarily been rude, but just unpleasant. The pleasantries go a long way with costumer satisfaction. I have already mentioned how I feel about the smoothie menu above and now its time to tackle the baked goods. Wow. These are just plan bad. The baked goods section is full of wraps, pretzels, etc. that are all pre made from corporate just waiting to be heated up as the costumer come in. Clearly a huge smudge on image of Jamba being a healthy alternative."
"Meatballs are excellent. Love the atmosphere too. Make sure to sit inside, way better than outside trust me."
"This is for the nightclub only. \n\nWe had a group of four guys and five girls. We were on a promoter's guestlist, so we skipped the general admission line. It was the longest wait at a club all weekend, maybe 10 minutes, max. The girls were free, the guys were discounted at $30 (wtf is general admission price then for this club?), yikes.\n\nWe headed upstairs...we had about 20 minutes of the open bar left. I found an open spot at the bar right away and got a drink. After all of the girls got our round of drinks, we all headed to the dance floor.\n\nThe opening DJ played old school music...not like good 90's old school music, but like between 2000-2005, that reminded you of high school dances. DJ Vice was the headlining DJ and he was pretty good. \n\nPeople were not joking when they said people are next to each other like sardines in a can. I don't know what it was about this crowd...if the girls here are lightweights and took full advantage of the open bar, or what. But these people were DRUNK. And not even drunk, but ANN0YING drunk. \n\nThe trapeze girl floating above the crowd was pretty cool. It's a nice looking club, but it's WAY too crowded. I'm not quite sure what the hype is about this club...but whatever. To each-their-own. The only way that I'd come to this club again is if I had a table. 0ther than that, this one can be checked off my \""to-do\"" list."
"Kate and I recently held our wedding at the Orpheum (ceremony and all) and it was fantastic. The service, the food, the setting were all something special. \n\nHats off to an excellent event coordinator, a helpful bar staff and some very tasty scallops (even if I was too busy to actually eat one)."
"I've stayed at almost all the big hotel casinos on the strip.\nI've stayed at Red Rock, the M Resort, and others off the strip.\nI used to live in Henderson, NV so I'm familiar with the area. One day I came back to visit friends and voila...There was a big beautiful rainbow high rise called, The Eastside Cannery! Now, I consider it to be one of my favorites. \n\nFirst, it is not on the strip. So if you don't have a car or know your way around Vegas, I wouldn't recommend it. That being said....Parking is easy and safe but there is no cover so in the summertime you need a sun visor for your windshield. The pool area is relaxing without all the fuss. Mostly locals in here so people are older but friendly. Table limits are low so you can enjoy yourself for awhile without breaking the bank. The rooms are clean and pretty modern for a local casino. There's free Wi-Fi and a mini fridge in every room. The big glass windows provide lots of sunlight and a beautiful view no matter what floor or room. Better bring your own lotion, soap, and/or shampoo if you require a large amount. Their dispensers are attached to the wall and refillable to save money.\n\nIf you have a car and know your way around the city, I recommend the Eastside Cannery. It's a great place to lay your head, have a cheap bite to eat, and gamble a bit. At about $50 a night, you can't beat it."
The mac and cheese and the ginger gin drink was great. My wife didn't like whatever chicken dish she ordered but we'll be back.
"For a change of scenery or you simply are sick of all-you-can-eat buffets, I would suggest this place. Just know that, like all other Asian restaurants, you are going to get terrible terrible service. The staff will act like they are doing you a favor by feeding you. The food at other Sam Woo's restaurants in Southern California is much better."
"On a long walk with the wife and we ducked in here.  SUPER friendly waiter named Brian.  Excellent service,  great breakfast (Top sirloin and eggs w/ sourdough and potatoes) for $7.95.  Coffee was good too.  I even asked to speak to the manager so I could let him know how happy we were with the food and especially the service.  He was very gracious and saw him give our waiter a \""thatta boy\"".  Not one negative."
"I HATE IT!!!!!!!\nThey charge you twice the amount, than you would normally pay at the neighborhood corner SB's.\nIt's the same coffee dammit!"
I have a food allergy and they had no idea how to prepare my food safely. The worst chipotle I've been to in any state.
"BROW SERVICES  WERE FIVE STAR!!!!!!\nNail service 1 star or less!!!!!!!\n  \nI bought a Groupon for three gel manis and pedis.  The Brow Lady is next to one of our favorite wine bars, so I thought that would work out great---park DH at Evo's, go get girly, then get treated to a nice dinner.  I made the appointment for the mani/pedi, then looking at my unruly brows, added on a brow shaping/wax.  I arrived at the The Brow Lady---receptionist was a nice young girl, and within moments I was greeted by Brandi, the Brow Artist.  I was with her for about 30 minutes.  She was wonderful.  Really warm, personable, professional.  She did a super job on my brows---gave a little more up-to-date shape, cleaned up all those \""downies\"" (as she called them).  I was loving her.  She mentioned she does reflexology---so now I am really excited.  I am envisioning making monthly appointments, getting my brows tidied, my nails done, my feet rubbed.  Followed by a nice dinner and a glass of wine.  Does it get any better?  I work hard and a lot of hours, I cherish the rare hours I get to pamper myself.\n\nFor the service, Brandi had to remove the color I had penciled in on my brows, and after, she offered to fill it back in because who wants to go to dinner with pale brows?  I really liked the color pencil she used and how nicely it blended, so I ended up buying one.  In fact, I was eyeing their whole make-up bar wondering if it wasn't time I did a cosmetic update....  I know---I am a product slut.\n\nSuffice to say, I was TOTALLY HAPPY with Brandi and her skill and customer service and I could easily have made her my \""go-to\"" for brow care.  But...\n\nI do want to mention this----I am a really good tipper.  And I ALWAYS tip full price on a Groupon, because I don't think the service person should have to suffer because I have a coupon.  And I was very happy with Brandi, so I tipped her 25%.\n\nThen she passed me on to the nail tech...who did not speak to me, did not make eye contact, carried on slightly inappropriate conversation with the other nail techs and ignored me and obviously was not listening when I told her how I liked my nails shaped, overwhelmed me first with music from a laptop and then her cell phone (I like Alicia Keyes and Beyonce, but not full blast 18 inches from my ears!), made me writhe into awkward positions to get my fingertips under the uv light rather than arrange the work service so I could do it easily, got defensive and a little rude when she clipped my nails too short to shape them the way I like (I TOLD you before you started!), had bright red polish all over the skin at the sides of my nails and the finish of the nail was not smooth and mirror-like, but had ripples and divots.  I was so upset that when she made a shooing motion toward the pedi-chair and said: Go sit there, I told her no, I am skipping the pedi.  I wasn't going to let her do a thing further to me.  I already had a half-assed gel manicure that will cost me $10-$20 to get stripped.  Then when I went to check out---pay for the brow wax and pencil---receptionist asked if I wanted to leave a gratuity for Brandi and Ashley (that's when I found out nail tech's name).  TG I had already given Brandi her tip.  And for the first time ever---DH couldn't believe it when I told him-- I didn't leave even a single cent of tip for that  unprofessional, inept girl---that's how upset I was.  My few hours of pampering ended very badly.  And I will never set foot in the place again, so I have lost the money I spent on the Groupon.\n\nYou may wonder why I won't go there if I liked Brandi so much.  How do I know her and that nasty girl aren't BFF's?  Would you put your precious brows in the hands of someone who might have a vendetta against you for dissing her friend?  Plus, now I just have a bad taste in my mouth for the whole establishment.  But in my opinion, Brandi should be working at one of the high-end spas----she has the personality and skill and customer service.  It's a shame she is wasted on a poorly managed place like The Brow Lady---and I say poorly managed, because I certainly would not stand for an employee providing the kind of service that Ashley did, and I wasn't impressed by the behavior of any of the techs.  So I was really torn on how to rate my experience---I tried to cut it down the middle, but as they say---treat a customer right, they'll tell two people---treat a customer wrong, and they'll tell a hundred."
Lame reservation policy- needs to be 4 hours ahead or you have to just show up. I think if you have the availability you should make the res. had a small party- now they lost the business- dumb
"I am a local, residing very near The Four Seasons. This is a first class operation.  We go to Talavera several times a year, to celebrate,or to have a quiet meal, etc.  Pork Chops are fantastic.  Warm rolls, whipped butter sprinkled with Hawaiian salt.  Everything done with precision and expertise.  You will want to try some things you never had before!  Service impeccable, as one would expect at The Four Seasons.  I love that they call us by name:  Mr and Mrs.  We will go back again and again.  Views are incredible, outside dining, too.  Very special place.   Great Onyx bar."
"I had the $19 prix fixe lunch today (5/14/10).  It was excellent!  I started with the onion tart and salad.  Main course was the couscous.  For dessert, I had the George V, a dark chocolate pastry filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, topped with peanuts and over a black sacher biscuit.  It was delightful.  \n\nYou can't go wrong with this lunch.  I really liked the small restaurant."
I was hosting a baby shower and ordered food from Roberts. Every time I called I felt rushed off the phone like they could care less if they had my business. Customer service is poor.\nSo I am setting up for the party and notice MOLD yes MOLD on the fruit and cheese platter. Then I notice that I only have half my order of grape leaves. I called them and Wendy walks into the party with a replacement platter. By that time my guests knew there was an issue with the food. How Embarrassing! \nI agree with a past post that they are a bit rude at times too. \nThey may be known for their cakes but I would steer clear from the catering.\nNEVER AGAIN
"Samurai Sam's tries hard at creating some Asian inspired food\n\nThe three of us came here last week, each ordering something different. I had three chicken tacos which were good, but had virtually no meat. As you can see from the photos, it's hard to find any. Lots of veggies though.\n\nAs for my friends, they each ordered different types of teriyaki bowls. Both came with a lot of rice, but again not much else.\n\nSadly, you can get  nearly twice as much food at Panda Express.  It's hard to justify coming back, our bill came to $24.70, including two soft drinks and one water. So, Two Stars and yes, we have had better.\n\nSorry!"
"This is located conveniently next to the hard rock hotel. When they say everything is bigger in Vegas, they aren't kidding. This cvs was huge and had everything you could possibly need. The pharmacist was very helpful - I have a cold on my vacation :( \nThe employees were very nice, but I feel like for the volume of people they had, they should've had more registers open."
Rooms were very old they need to update it the casino and hotel itself was not bad.
"Great food as always.  The owner is incredibly professional, friendly and charismatic;came buy three times to check in on experience and even asked if we wanted more antipasto salad items(on an already generous, well-priced portion.)  The service is great.  Homemade breads.  Extremely generous portions.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to all."
"Worst return policy in town!  The store manager did not even respect me, the paying customer, enough to come to the customer service desk to discuss a requested return. I tried to return a brand new dress with the tags attached and the original receipt, however, because I purchased the item more than 30 days ago they refused to issue me a credit to my Visa.  I was given a store credit.  My fiance tried to return a defective bottle of cologne this past weekend (the pump spray stopped working) and they would not exchange the defective item for a working item. We will be taking all of our business away from Ross and shopping at other discounters like Target, Anna's Linens, Tuesday Mornings, TJ Maxx, anywhere but Ross."
"The two stars are for one thing.. The SLICE.  It is a descent piece of pie that would only be completely wonderful at 3am after a long night of drinking.  Other than that, this place is grimy, creepy, and nasty.  I would suggest trying one of the other Fuels outside of the city.. Trust me.  \n\n-Ian M."
"This Pizza Hut is very close to my house and we are frequent customers.  The staff is friendly enough and, in my opinion, the pizza is great.  We usually get the hand tossed pizza and honey barbeque boneless wings, which I LOVE.  I've also had their thin crust pizza which is good as well.  They usually have some deals going on too, like $10 any size pizza.  Their quality is consistent and their prices are reasonable."
"Got in for free since we stayed at the Venetian.  Pretty convenient since we just prepartied in our rooms and came downstairs to dance.  \n\nThey played awesome music the whole night and the service was pretty good (bouncers were polite).  Only gripes were that the boys were just sooooo grabby.  They figure that since they got a booth and give you a drink, they have the rights to touch you.  Ummmm, no.  \n\n I just enjoyed the music, danced the night away, stayed close to my friends.  I would go here again if it was free."
"This is definitely my go-to place for AYCE sushi!!! I've tried numerous AYCE places in Vegas, and this place never disappoints. It's also one of the cheapest places to go to with an abundance of choice of rolls to appetizers. Their service here is pretty great. They've always taken care of me whenever I go there. If ever there was a conflict or mistake on my order, they're willing to fix it without any complaints. The one waitress there, who I think is a co-owner, is super sweet! Last time I was there, they screwed up on my order BIG TIME but she took care of it and was super nice to me. \n\nMust try their calamari and shrimp tempura for appetizers! Cinderella roll and Lasagna roll is so good-a-licious! And I love love love their nigiri. It's always fresh and it's like the fish melts in your mouth. I can never get enough of the salmon and tuna nigiri. My mouth is watering just thinking about them! \n\nThe only down side is the wait for the food sometimes. It's not always consistent but other than that.. I am super in love with this place! That would be the only reason why I didn't give it five stars.  \n\nDefinitely give this place a try! I doubt you'd be disappointed.. BUT don't go there with super high standards.\n\nFYI: This place does half rolls! I always order half rolls, so I can gobble up on all of my favorites!"
"Such an awesome show. So much fun to be had. The music is great, the dancing is outstanding and the comedy is top rate."
"Very disappointed in this restaurant for a few reasons. Though we were the only two people standing in front of them at 6pm on a Friday, the hostesses largely ignored us for two minutes gossiping quietly even after I said \""hello\"" and went ungreeted. That's fine, sometimes you get that when you hire teenagers - I get it. Our waitress was nowhere to be found for a good 10 minutes after we were seated and she was nice enough. Service was fine, not outstanding (after our drinks were empty for most of the meal) but no huge complaints - she was busy. I get that too. Unfortunately my boyfriend came down with food poisoning about seven hours after the meal and had to seek medical attention. The doctor confirmed it - all we had to do was say \""Famous Dave's.\"" We had to come back to the location afterward to pick up an item we had left and my boyfriend asked to speak with a manager to let him know he had gotten sick - the manager told him there was no way it was the food there and immediately gave him the brush off. Obviously the manager couldn't outright admit fault due to legal reasons, but that was the final straw for us. We won't be back."
"meh.\n\nif you are into hanging out with as many frat brothers as can be squeezed into a half block, this place is totally your jam.  \n\ni'm not.  \n\nit's crowded.  the service sucks.  the drinks are watery.  the food is just.... well, shitty bar food. and it's loud.  and did i mention crowded?  i am sure it appeals to a lot of people.... who go to college, wish they were in college, or wish they were boning someone of college age.... but man, i'm a realist.  that ship has sailed.  i was so hoping it would be a nice outdoor venue for people who didn't want to hit the campus scene.  it's not though.  it used to be.  now i avoid it like that plague.  \n\nif you are looking for a dj who cranks out the frat favorites of 2007 and does it loud and proud... you will love this bar.  if you are looking for a chill place to hang out with your friends and have a couple decent beers, there are other options."
"We asked for table side guacamole and our waiter said \""I'll make it for you then bring it out\"" then I said \""no, we want TABLE SIDE GUACAMOLE\"" he again said \""trust me on this. .. I'll make it for you then bring it out and I won't charge you the table side price.. we are too backed up in the kitchen.\"" I told him to go tell his manager what he told me or I was going to tell him.... judging by the managers reaction when he came to our table... he most likely told all his servers to do this on their shift. Eat at the one on Las Vegas Blvd or go elsewhere."
"On our last day in Montreal, a group of friends and I did a bike tour around the city with Fitz & Folwell. We had to reserve a few weeks in advance, and our preferred date (Saturday) was fully booked - so definitely call ahead if you have interest. The tour starts at 10 and is advertised to end at 2 - but be aware that if you do have slow riders in your group (and we had a couple who crashed a few times, which slowed down our tail rider), it will go longer. Our bike tour ended at 3:45 PM, which was substantially later than we anticipated - but the weather was incredibly gorgeous out (70 degrees with nary a cloud in the sky), so I did not mind at all.\n\nIf you show up around 15 minutes ahead of time, it's easy enough to get set up - you head out back (which is really just walking through the back of the store to a back road, where it's easy to get people set up on their bikes). After a short introduction (we had Frederic as our guide, and Mimi, a McGill student, as our tail rider), we were on our way. There's much more of a balance at the beginning of talking about the sites are you ride through McGill through downtown, and eventually down through Old Montreal to the water; once you bike past Old Port (which you will stop by later on), you get a decent amount of stretch where you are just biking beside Lachine Canal to Atwater Market. There, you'll eat lunch (which, for us, was pizza...and they even bought me a beer, which was quite awesome) on the old, unused tracks that ran along the canal before heading back. As mentioned previously, you'll stop by Old Port before heading up through the Latin Quarter and Plateau Mont-Royal back to the shop. It's a very informative tour that mixes in the sites of more modern Montreal with its older past. Frederic was very charming and knowledgeable about the sites, and didn't talk for too long - which can be a drawback of informative tours at times. The way the tour is designed, such that it does allow for an extended stretch of pure biking, was a nice way to make it feel more like you're just out for a bike ride and not stopping all the time.\n\nIn all, this was a phenomenal experience. If you are looking for a tour that will give you a great overview of the main areas of Montreal, this is a must-do. The shopowners are incredibly friendly, and it's right by Mont-Royal as well - so it's centrally located. Even if you haven't biked for a long time (and this was my first time in nearly 10 years), you won't feel like you're in danger, mainly because Montreal drivers have a sense of courtesy that some (like those in my native New York City) lack."
"Don't let the Pizza Hut exterior fool you; this is a decent place to grab a quick, fresh and cheap sushi combo lunch. \n\nHave been a few times with friends and mostly order the Sushi A combo for $8.95, which gets you two maki rolls (generally go with the California and Spicy Tuna), a ginger salad, and an egg roll. The ginger dressing here is quite good, but be sure to ask for it on the side unless you want your lettuce literally drowning in ginger goodness. The veggie egg roll isn't too greasy and the sushi is average but fresh. All this for $8.95 makes it a great lunch deal if you're in the Cotswold area. \n\nA must have if you aren't ordering off of the combo menu is the Cherry Blossom roll. It's the best roll I've had at Koishi and comes out looking like a flower, which gives it a little extra something, in my humble opinion. \n\nService is a bit on the slow side but generally friendly. And there is plenty of parking on the side and behind the building. Only gripe is that it's tough to get in/leave with the barrier in center of Sharon Amity and the no U-turn signs, but no worries; it's worth the bit of extra maneuvering."
I knew our trip to Vegas would not be complete if we did not watch a show and since we booked at The Mirage it was but natural to include tickets to Cirque de Soleil's The Beatles LOVE. The theater's seating is circular which is not your traditional theater seating so it's a bit tricky when you buy tickets online and choose your seats. My husband and I were in the 201 section row N and I believe they were good seats. The performance was great and totally reflected the Beatles songs they chose.
My favorite neighborhood grocery store! Great selection of some interesting variation of the foods I like to eat... all at reasonable prices while maintaining high quality.\n\nI also like the fact that these stores are not very large. Makes it easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. \n\nMuch more fun to go to Trader Joes than to WholeFoods... in my humble opinion.
"Was a big fan until yesterday. Hot sauce used to be the best, now just tasted like tomato sauce. Food was awful, they're only excuse was that they are training new chefs. Sadly, we will not go back."
They need to hire a receptionist who is willing to give business to their salon and stylist. I just got off the phone with THE WORST receptionist of all time who had no clue on how to run a salon. talking my business elsewhere.
"Imagine those restaurants that you went to when you were a kid with your family.  Where you were forced to be dressed up and try to act like an adult.  Because the grandparents decided the restaurant, it probably had its hay day about 40 years ago and hasnt changed a thing since.  They still remember it as having great food and a wonderful atmosphere.  \nThese are the memories I get at Bravo Franco and I didnt even grow up in Pittsburgh.  Unfortunately, the hay day of Bravo Franco seemed to have passed, if it was ever there, a long time ago.  \nThe service was decent which is its lone bright point.  The food just wasnt very tasty.  The Snapper special was swimming.  The veal looked tough.  The Cappucino was watery.  Trying to find a bright spot on this one."
Bad Service at the desk.
"I'm going to revise my review of Quiet Storm.\n\nYou may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulously-designed vegetarian sandwich. In my experience, however (considering the 30+ Cubanos I've eaten there), you're more likely to get a sad, mediocre rendition.\n\nConsistency is not their strong point.\n\nAdd to that the likelihood that you may be dosed with some surly owner attitude, and I've decided to steer clear.\n\nIt's a shame that I no longer feel it's worth it to chase the beautiful dream of my first meals at Quiet Storm. It's also a shame that many of their staff are wonderful, friendly, and helpful, and yet their efforts are overshadowed.\n\nSorry, Quiet Storm. As a Pittsburgh vegetarian, I want to love you. But you broke my heart."
"For a place being famous for their meat...it didn't live up to par.  I ordered the Rib Eye and it was really dry and flavorless.  I understand the Ribeye is a fattier cut but my piece was over 50% fat.  bleh. In addition, my Medium Rare was VERY rare.  On the side note, the fries here are great! ironic, everything I liked at this dinner was non-brazillian related. \n\nSome of our party opted for the all you can eat bbq but everyone wasn't feeling too great 30 minutes after our meal. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was their grand salad bar. Not only salads but had many sides. My favorite was actually the mini baby back ribs and corn cheese bread. I felt like I should of skipped the $40 steak and just opted for the all you can salad bar. \n\nTip: they have restauarant.com or if you have the Planet Hollywood Hotel Chain players card - they will give you 10% off your bill."
"What a great place!  I've been going here for the past year about twice per week.  The facility is always clean and the staff is friendly.  The concept of this theater is nothing but fun. They have a bar located in the lobby with seating if you choose to have a drink while waiting for friends. You can take your drink with you in the movie if you do not finish it.  There are \""2\"" theater types. Fork N Screen permits children where \""Cinema Suites\"" only permits 21 and over. Both serve the same food & drink menu. The Fork N Screen has more seating but the seats do not recline where the Cinema Suites are far more private and the seats recline. I love the little red help buttons next to each seat if you need service, hit the button and voila... they show up! The food is average, the apps are pretty good, and the drinks are fun. There are really good restaurants located in the Esplande if you choose to have dinner elsewhere and then see a movie.  They also validate for parking for 4 hours!  Overall, this is a great spot for a night alone, date night, girls night, or a family afternoon. AMC also has a stubs program ($12.00 year) I use it to earn points and free dollars to use."
"I tried to go here last night; party of five.  The hostess told us that it would be an hour and 45 minutes before we could be seated, even though there were only a couple of people waiting and there were a few tables inside and all but two tables outside were being used.\n\nNo problem, we went downstairs to RA and had a great meal."
"Still a great hidden gem!\nIf you're looking for good seafood, without having to hit the Strip.. this is the place\n\nMy husband and I were without the kids, and needed to eat near the Galleria. \nBefore kids we went to the Oyster Bar which we loved. So we decided to head back after 10 years. \n\nStill the same great service and food! \n\nWe were immediately greeted and told to sit anywhere we would like, I choose the bar next to the cooking pots. The aroma coming out of the pots was wonderful. Clearly whet my appetite. \n\nWe looked over the menu, which had all of your favorite seafood selections. We were up in the air between the Cioppino or Boullabaisse. Both looked and smelled delicious. After having a side salad, which was large we went with the Boullabaisse. \nLots of seafood - Clams, Mussels, Crab, Shrimp and chunks of white fish, swimming in a flavorful saffron broth filled with leaks and onions. YUM! \nCouple of beers & wine, our meal was complete! \n\nOnly drawback, the clams were a bit gritty.. but that can happen... \nGlad we went and need to go back sooner than 10 years from now."
"It really takes a lot to agitate me and yet the girl(s) at Rebel Oil #66 on the corner of Decatur and Flamingo managed to do just that.  I went in for gas.  The card reader at the pump was not working so I went in to pay for my gas.  There are two girls standing behind the counter talking ane one doing some type of inventory in front of the counter.  They ignore me for nearly 3 minutes.  Now you may be saying,,, \""Come on, its only three minutes\"" but when you are the only one other than the three of them standing there it seems like an eternity.  No \""Hello\"", \""I will be right with you\"" Nothing.  They just kept talking to each other and refused to acknowledge me until I cleared my throat.  All I got was a look.  No greeting, no inquiry, no nothing she just gave me the \""What do you want?\"" look.  So I ask for my gas, she rings it in and I walk back to my car.  No salutation,,,, nothing,  Just the look of irratation that I had interupted her morning coffee conversation with her coworker.  I am sure it was important and had something to do with cold fusion, world peace, molecular chemistry or something like that.  (Insert sarcasm here).  I get to the pump and low and behold.... nothing.  The pump wont turn on.  I go back in.  Still no inquiry what so ever so I say. \""I am not getting anything on the pump\"".  She goes over to the register and a few seconds later spouts out  \""Ok, go ahead\"".  Wow, she actually does speak.  Back to the pump.  Same problem.  I go back in.  I ask if they can just change my pump number.  She says \""Did you hit the green button?\""  (No, dumbass, you did not tell me I had to hit the freaking green button.) Since fairness is always in order this time I did not say anything I just turned around and walked back to the pump.  I finally get my gas and as I pull out the first thing in my mind is I am going to rip this joint on Yelp!  \nYou would think that with the hundreds of gas stations around (a lot with cheaper gas), the people working in them would make at least a tiny effort to be polite and friendly.  I guess Rebel Oil #66 on Decatur and Flamingo does not think that is necessary.  \n\nJoin my quest and get your gas somewhere else please."
"Went on a Saturday night a couple weeks ago.  It's no cover before 10pm, but on that particular night (which happened to be a fight night) the place was already packed by our 930 arrival time.  For the price and the amount of time to wait in line (0 minutes 0 seconds), this place kicks ghostbar's pretentious butt!  The view is nicer because it's right on the strip, you can actually sit down (the tables aren't all \""reserved\""), the bartenders are friendly, the music is kept at a volume high enough to hear but low enough that you don't have to shout over it, and the crowd was lively.  Too bad the patio was closed off that night, no doubt for the fight night VIPs and hangers-on.  Dunno about the restaurant, but judging from these reviews here I might have to check it out next time through.  A+++ will do business with again!"
"My sister and I ate here, after we saw an ad about the restaurant which made the place seem like it was a hot spot for celebrites. There were pictures of Rachel Bilson and even Paris Hilton celebrating parties there, so we felt that it must be good. FIX was described as having gourmet \""college food\"". It definitely had those bad things we all loved in college when we had no time to cook. We ordered the Mini Kobe Burger sliders, and the famed Buffalo Chicken wings. We even ordered some fries, which came in a cute little swirl like container. All of the food we ate was good. The price can be on the upper side, but it's still a nice trendy place to eat at in the Bellagio. I might suggest eating the steak, since it is also advertised as having one of the best steak in Vegas (as do many restaurants by many different critics!)"
"Just making sure to give Sambalatte the love that it deserves!\n\nThe Nutella latte is still at the top of my list and my husband loves the regular latte.  Came here tonight around 8pm and they had a jazz duo playing the trumpet and keyboard.  Absolutely LOVED it!  It just added to the charm of this coffee joint.\n\nWhile their drinks are great, I'm obsessed with their macaroons.  They are a little pricey ($16.50 for 12 of them) but they are tiny bites of deliciousness!  Tonight I ordered 10 of them to go- one of each flavor and two for my husband to eat while enjoying his coffee.  They put them in a perfect little box for easy take home.  Yum!\n\nOur friends enjoyed their gluten free almond cookies and some herbal lemonade.  She said they were both really good and her lemonade even had a pretty little flower in it!\n\nEveryone is really nice and I'm still in love with this little relaxing gem inside of Boca Park!"
"I started off my visit to Quaker Steak with the Atomic Wing Challenge, which is just eating six of their atomic wings.  Six wings obviously isn't much, but the atomic wings are quite spicy and they require that you sign a liability waiver before eating them (this is more for show than anything).  Yes, they're pretty damn hot, but they're bearable as long as you have a good tolerance for spicy food.  If you're comfortable eating foods with habaneros in them, then you'll have no problem with the atomic wings.  Here's a pro-tip though: if you're getting the atomic wings, ask them for a pair of food-handling gloves.  This way you can avoid getting wing sauce all over your hands, allowing you to actually touch your eyes or use the restroom later that day without torturing yourself.\n\nAnyway, after I finished that off, I went back and got some more wings - Louisiana Lickers, Arizona Ranch, and Golden Garlic.  I was impressed with the flavors, as everything was quite good.  The wings were nice and meaty too, which is good because a lot of wing places manage to hunt down wings with almost no meat on them, which kind of defeats the purpose of eating them in the first place.\n\nMy one complaint is that I think the wings are a bit overpriced.  A half dozen wings is $5, and 83 cents per wing seems rather high to me.  Still though, these wings are much better than most, so it's probably worth it."
"LOVE, love, love this place! Even still after I moved. I've yet to found any place that can compare to Yanni's Gyros. I'm so proud of myself for discovering this little gem!\n\nI'm not a big fan of lamb, but I seriously enjoy their lamb gyro. Their tzatziki sauce is so good, I always want to ask for more just to dip my gyro before every bite. They stuff their gyros with a lot of onion, that's a plus for me. And their hummus is delish! It's the best hummus I've ever had. I'm so addicted, I wished they could do shipments! I also had the pleasure of trying their garlic-feta fries, what a brilliant creation, it's a little spicy but you just can't stop eating it. I always make a pivotal stop every time I am in Vegas. They are pricey but it's money well spent.\n\nThe family are also very kind. I hope everyone continues to go here, I want to keep them in business forever!"
"This is for the lounge only-  Do not ever pay cover to get in here!!!  Cover should not even exist at this place, but if you can't find the guy in the casino making it rain passes, you deserve to pay.  There is no dress code to speak of- if that's your thing.  Went up, walked outside for a bit-nice view, too cold, went back inside, ordered a witch doctor, listened to music, watched bartender make witch doctors, finished drink, left, no more line to get in.  Uh yeah."
"Breakfast is always reliable here.  The omelets are always made just as ordered, the California Ham and Eggs has a nice big slice of ham again (got small for a while but back to size now - at a premium price too) and you can get raisin toast instead of white or wheat, a nice touch."
"This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right."
Bogey's is one of my favorite places to go. I've gone more than 30 times and I've never had a bad experience. The wait staff is friendly and efficient and always fun! Tuesdays they have trivia and $1 tacos and they have great beer and other drink specials through out the week! One of my favorite things about this bar is that I can go and have a great night out and not worry about spending too much money!
"The man at the front desk had amazing customer service. Let us know what places would deliver food late at night, made suggestions when we asked what casinos would be most convenient, and let us buy snacks from the \""shop\"" even though it was closed. He even walked us out to the parking garage to make sure we could open the gate and let us know the best spots to park. The room was super clean. Yes---you definitely have to watch out for the corners of the beds---the room is cramped and the base of the beds jut out. Also, our shower didn't drain well, but we were too tired to ask to change rooms for just one night. The hot-wire price was less than $40. Definitely a great deal."
"Think of Cheers.  If you go more than once you're family here.  The menu is varied and all done well.  The beer list is constantly rotating and they do a great job with the local brewers.  Staple of the neighborhood. \n\nFavorites:\nSliders: pork, chicken, or kobe \nSalmon blt\nChili\nRib Thursdays \nSpicy chicken sandwich \nTarot tots"
Our favorite Sushi restaurant!  Richard is awesome and the food and presentation is Awesome!  We are here about once a week!!
Friendly staff and I come here for the $5 gyro sandwich lunch special. Someone else ordered meatball and pasta and has been very content.
"Pre-renovation I was a huge fan on Tyber, and yes, due to it's proximity to my abode, it still gets more than one star, but taking out the games upstairs and replacing them with booths... not okay. \n\nThe food has always been decent (especially for midnight fare), the bartenders have always been great, but walking upstairs was a disaster. I never noticed a seating problem before, but apparently the owners did... oddly enough, the high tables were still busy as usual, but all of the booths sat empty. Only once the upstairs bathroom line grew too long did people start to occupy the nearest cushion. Also, instead of people being able to gravitate to a high top away from the stairwell like they used to, they were stuck standing right near the stairs (or the bathroom) and walking from one side of the upstairs to the other was more hassle than needed be. \n\nTyber has definitely dropped on my list of near-home stop ins, but on an off night where I think it'll be slow enough I don't have to head upstairs for a seat, I'll probably be back."
"I was at the New York New York lobby at the Strip and looking for a meaty place (burger, steaks, etc.). While walking around I saw this place, and went to sit in the bar.\nThe regular burger (with no cheese) was surprisingly one of the best burgers I had in years and I am not exaggerating a bit. It was organic and I orderer it to cook as medium well. The burger came out so juicy, tender, flavory and delicious that it literally made my day. I am planning on going there again tonight to get the same burger. And the added bonus is that it was under $10!\nBartender Dawn was funny and pleasant to talk to. We made a few jokes and had a good laugh. She also gave me some good tips on things to see in Vegas."
"That's it?  Don't even bother.\n\nThe casinos here do offer better pay.  We found full pay jacks or better machines at the Four Queens.  But you have to suffer through the slummiest of skank old school casinos.  Probably NOT worth it.\n\nWon't be heading back \""downtown\"" on future trips."
"Wish I could provide a better review, but it just isn't there.\n\nThe good:\nHe allowed me to bring my dog into the store while I looked/talked.  This is nice when vendors allow pets.  However, Delilah apparently had the same vibe regarding the guy as I did - creepy.  For me, it was the attitude and that he was obviously packing heat.  Kinda felt like he's the kind of guy that is looking for any reason to pull it out.  \nHe offered a couple of brochures.\n\nThe not good:\nCreepy vibe, and did a hard sell.  Also gave bad information regarding sidecars based on my other research prior to and subsequent to the visit.  I wasn't testing him - I wanted genuine guidance.  Didn't trust his at all.\n\nI was visiting from out of town, and mostly just 'looking', but if I lived in the area, no way would I go back here."
"I returned to Hatfield Family Medicine, 36 weeks pregnant, after a few years of not seeing a primary care physician. I rarely go to the doctor but have had regular visits with my OB during my pregnancy and he requested that I receive a vaccine from my PCP... I complied and made the appointment with the last office I had been to, Hatfield. \n\nWhen I called to schedule the appointment the girl that I spoke to on the phone was VERY rude, short and seemed to be talking to someone else in the background about something unrelated to my phone call. I gave her all of my insurance information (ID numbers and such) and set a date. I then asked her if my vaccine would be covered by my insurance policy and she bluntly told me that it was my job to find that out, not hers. Fine. \n\nOn the day of my appointment I arrived 10 minutes early, and signed in. There were 3 women at the desk when I arrived and not one of them greeted or even acknowledged me upon arrival. I gave them my insurance card and photo id when they finally got to me (I was the ONLY one in the waiting room at the time) and was then told, with a snotty attitude, that I needed to call my insurance and have their doctor added to my list as I had been assigned to another doctor. Again, Fine. \nI don't mind making a phone call, that I can only assume could have been done LONG before my appointment time, if someone would have had the decency to ask me to do so. They could have easily asked me to make the call prior to my appointment instead of snapping at me in the waiting room 5 minutes prior to my appointment because it wasn't done. (I should also mention that I am new to this insurance plan and had NO IDEA that I was even assigned to a doctor, let alone a doctor that wasn't theirs!!) \n\nMy appointment was in the very early morning, so I partially understand the lack of enthusiasm in the office, but after dealing with the front office staff I am fully convinced that their bad attitude is probably an all day type of thing. I was hoping that I could voice my concern to the doctor, but he too was rushed and seemed inconvenienced by my appointment. After seeing the doctor and receiving the ONE vaccine that I had to go through all this trouble for, I was then left to exit the office on my own and was, again, not acknowledged on my way out, even after stopping at the counter to make sure no co-pay was due. \n\nI work in the medical field and can tell you first hand that staff like this in any other office would be terminated... It's a shame that an office built upon \""family values\"" hires such unpleasant personnel to be the face of their business."
"My first time going to this spa and I love it! The customer service exceeded my expectation. It's a far drive, but from the many salon location near where I live I will defiantly take the time to go to this location. My main core in a salon is cleanness and customer service. Kathy was very friendly and knowledgeable about the product along with providing me clear answer to all my question. I would recommend making appointment as they seem to have consistent customer."
"Wow, what a complete ass the owner is. Walked in with a simple power board with some bad capacitors and he refused to even look at it. Went on a 5 minute tirade about the internet and amateurs and how he's sick of helping people and wasting his savings on this business. I just backed out of his cigarette-smelling store in disbelief. Stay FAR away from this nut."
"THEY WERE RUNNING! Superb service, superb price, superb quality. And running, I tell you, to keep the service up taking orders and refilling drinks and settling checks and serving food.  Holy cow. I dropped in for lunch earlier this week again, and everything was exactly like I said in my initial review. This place is a joy for me every time. Wow. Holy cow. Incredible."
We only went to this place once and I wasn't very impressed.  We had to wait outside in the hot sun for a table since the restaurant is so small.  The food was nothing exciting and it is not a comfy atmosphere at all.  The only good thing is that the prices are low and I am sure it would be fast service on a weekday since you order at the counter.
This cart features local and organic fare.  The pasture raised pork carnitas are fantastic.  Hands down the best food cart around Charlotte.
Ok food... I wouldnt go back. Not much else to say...
Slowwwww service. From waiting 30 minutes to be seated (with open tables) to waiting 20 minutes before being able to order and 40 minutes for our food.
This is a unique concept that is well executed.\n\nFull disclosure: I am a clothing rep and I visit vintage and reuse boutiques as part of my job.\n\nPreloved is mostly affordable and has taken their idea full swing. Definitely worth a visit.
"Having recently moved to Highland Creek, my fianc\u00e9 and I started exploring the area for good food. We saw this place while we were driving by so decided to give it a try. \nWe went in on a Wednesday night. The place wasn't too full, just about 3 other tables were occupied. We were told to pick any table. The server took our beverage order and got us our menus. For a restaurant with about 10-12 tables they only had one server and she wasn't super knowledgable. Maybe she was new. She seemed nice, even though we had to remind her twice to bring us the chilli oil (again, one server for too many tables). \nWe ordered the hot and sour soup and Triple Star for our entree. The hot and sour soup was pretty bland. It lacked flavor, salt and spice. Even some salt, pepper and soy sauce didn't fix it. The Triple Star (a combination of chicken, shrimp and beef in a brown sauce) was decent enough. I would definitely order that again, although it's nothing super awesome to write about. \nAt one point the owner came out to survey the place. By then there was just one other table still occupied. He asked them how the food was etc etc. He did look over at us twice and made eye contact but didn't think it was important enough to ask us how our food was. Oh well, I go to a restaurant for not just food but service as well. I didn't feel welcome here. I'm not sure I would consider going here, especially when there's another decent Chinese restaurant just 5 minutes away. Oh and by the way, no fortune cookies with the check :("
"My bf and I decided to take my cousin here for dinner per my cousin's request.  I wasn't sure what to expect but was very impressed by the service and food.  \n\nWe were served with this refreshing tea that was in an original looking jug.  The cups were made of some kind of silver metal and I think it was a bowl too.  Different.  Our server was very attentive and constantly came to our table to make sure we were okay and if we were ready to choose our dinner.\n\nWe finally chose and this was what we ended up with.\n1.)  Albap 8:  Kimchi, vegetables and fish roe on top of rice in a stone pot.  This was really good.  The fish roe gave it a good flavor.\n\n2.)  Ribs:  This was a little tough to eat.  I'm used to my ribs falling apart very easily.\n\n3.)  Chicken in hot sauce:  Too hot for my liking.  They said it wasn't too hot, but my pallet says otherwise.\n\n4.)  Side dishes with gaikon, asian broccolli, kimchi, beef, and I can't think of the names of the others.  But it was definitely a lot of side dishes on top of what we had ordered.\n\nOverall experience was top notch!"
"Every time I come here, I want to leave with something.  The 16 international flavors of Coke is interesting.  It costs $7 and they give you a fair amount, so you could split it with like 2 or 3 otehr people.  Must try it.  Obviously a very touristy place but it's fun."
"I get really annoyed with these \""fancy\"" hotels who don't offer the refrigerator and microwave in their standard rooms, which I can get at a Holiday Inn Express or a Comfort Inn for probably half the price.  \n\nAlso, for the love of all things holy, don't charge people for WiFi in 2011 after they already paid you an arm and a leg for a room that isn't worth it.  That is RIDICULOUS.\n\nThere's at least a half-mile walk (without a sidewalk) to anything except a small convenience store.\n\nThe room was comfortable enough, but no greater than any 3-star hotel I've ever stayed in."
"Absolutely love Nevada Nails everyone is very friendly here. Lyn the manager is very nice and very good at what she does, of you are looking for designs Lyn is your girl . Lyn also does the best eyebrows.\n\nJORDAN  IS THE BEST. He takes his time (literally) but everytime he does my nails they last twice as long. I've been coming here for a year and half and do not have any plans of going else where"
My daughter went here and ordered the sampler platter and is highly allergic to shrimp she asked to subsitute it for something else and they said no.  They could put it on the side.  I called the manager and they said it is not cost effective for them to do this.  I called corporate and they said they do not do substitutions and they have no way to ensure there is no cross contamination with products people are allergic to.  This is a scary thought.  I work in a restaurant and there is away to do it.  Please if you have allergies or medical issues and you are not able to have certain items do NOT go to any Black Angus.  This is there company policy.
"if you're looking for a nice night out, keep looking..."
Terrible service. The guy was very mean. I'm glad I am just a tourist. But don't go here. There are other great kosher places around town. Jerusalem grill has a friendlier staff.
"I've stayed at nearly every hotel in Madison in this price range. There's not a lot of variation in the quality of the hotel or the rooms themselves. The devil, as they say, is in the details.\n\nPros:\n\n*free Wi-Fi\n\n*free parking\n\n*comfortable bed\n\n*warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in\n\n*convenient location\n\n*indoor pool and whirlpool\n\n*on-site restaurant \n\n*friendly staff\n\n*free local shuttle\n\nCons:\n\n*weird shower. Clearly they're going for a \""European\"" feel as there was only half a glass door on the stall so I experienced an unpleasant draft on my backside during the shower\n\n*it's a little dated. This used to be a Howard Johnson, and it still has a bit of a \""low budget\"" feel\n\n*slow elevators, and too few\n___________________________________________\n\nAs with any hotel in any city, price will vary during season. We happened to be in Madison during move-in weekend for incoming freshman at UW, so the price was likely higher than normal, but still was not terribly expensive.\n\nAlthough the location was great, it was also across the street from a house that some undergrads were moving into and hosting a kegger, so it was a bit loud at times, but thankfully it ended early. Come to think of it, the whole neighborhood is full of undergrad housing, so be forewarned.\n\nThis isn't my favorite hotel in Madison, but I would definitely stay here again."
"If I could rate them 0 I would. I am still sitting on the side of the road waiting for them to arrive I called 3 hours ago and they said 75 minutes and they still are not here. Last I checked 75 minutes was 1 hour and 15 minutes. After reading all the reviews it's clear this company does not care about their reputation. I have say in the Arizona heat for 3 hours because of their lack of professionalism.  Do not use this company at all seriously call someone else. I just called another company because it's been 3.5 hours and I haven't even gotten an update or courtesy call. The other company said 1.5 hours give or take 15 minutes let's see who shows up first. I will update with answer soon\n\nCentral showed up after 4hours, I did cancel the other tow cause I'm not rude, but I will never use central towing again because they were not remotely close to the time promised even 30 min late would have been forgivable but 2 hours 45 min late in 100 degree weather is unacceptable. Then offering no discount or anything stay away"
"Food is always fantastic and today's review is solely based off the amazing customer service. \n\n\nMy friend and I came here to eat lunch (12-27-2014) and this place was packed.... lines out the entrance. After we paid and walked over to find a table, there were several tables that opened up but still had plates. The manager (I am assuming he is a manager because he was one of the two wearing dress shirts) came over, cleaned off the plates and wiped down the table top as well as the seat. Gayle was our server and was very attentive, refilling our coffee, remembering each of our orders and desserts. Also at the end of our lunch, we wanted to pick up our dessert later so we asked her to keep it in the front. \n\nReturning after shopping to pick up our dessert, I asked the cashier for our cake and was very prompt even though it was busy inside. I saw the manager again bringing food out. My friend and I are restaurant owners and naturally we are very observant when it comes to front and back house/customer service. We were thoroughly impressed how the manager wasn't just delegating to get the task done, but he was jumping in to get things done. You don't see that in Las Vegas corporate restaurants much... at all!!!\n\nI asked the cashier who the gentleman was, and he stated his name is Scott and was the general manager. \n\n\nWell done Nordstrom, your 5 star customer service isn't just reflected in the department stores but also your restaurant as well."
Used to be a favorite place to eat for my wife and I until we found a metal screw in my wifes Huevos Rancheros. Dissapointing. I had eaten there for over 20 years. Still a great place to have a beer but I'll never eat there again.
"I've been a regular for several years now, and it's still my favorite place in town. Everything is delicious - everything. Close your eyes and point. Not only that, but you can feel the love and passion that goes into everything both aesthetic and edible. And they care about YOU. I can go for 6 months without being able to visit Baguette, and Olivier still welcomes me like family and asks how I've been as casually as if I'd been seeing him every week. \n\nI see a lot of people complaining about how to find the place. \n\nHERE IS A TIP FOR THE EASIEST WAY TO GET TO BAGUETTE. \n\nIf you are driving westbound on the 215, take the Buffalo exit. Go straight through the light at the top of the hill. You will be on a street parallel to the freeway, and you will drive right up next to the business park on your right before you hit Durango. There will be 3 total turns off of that side road (also known as Raphael Rivera Way). Take either the 2nd or the 3rd and you will be at Baguette. It is right in between those two entrances, up against Raphael Rivera. It truly doesn't get any easier than that. See? Not so hard?\n\nIf you truly have no choice but to drive through the business park (say, if you were coming east/southbound on the 215),  when you turn off of Sunset do NOT just drive all willy nilly through the middle of the business park. That's how you are all getting so frustrated and hitting dead ends. Look at a Google map. If you refuse to look at a map ahead of time, then stick to the west side of the business park. Take Ganger Rd when you turn off Sunset, and stick closely to that far west side of the business park as you wind your way to the back of the business park towards Raphael Rivera. Eventually you will see that row of buildings that Baguette is tucked into in the very back peeking through the larger business structures.\n\nBut seriously. Just look at a map. It's worth it.\n\n*After going today, I noticed that they've expanded their outdoor seating. TONS of places to sit now with plenty of umbrellas, it's very exciting for their lunchtime rush to see some extra room!"
"We met family from out of town here to eat (since that's where they wanted to go). I've had better, it wasn't awful... but I'm not inclined to go back.\n\nBest things I had:\n\n1) mini carrot cake complete with cream cheese frosting, it was nicely spice and how carrot cake is supposed to be.\n\n2) peel and eat cold shrimp and snow crab legs. The crab was sweet, the shrimp were nicely flavored. They both tasted fresh and not fishy.\n\n3) fresh fruit the melon, strawberries and pineapple were all juicy and flavorful.\n\nMediocre things:\n1) steamed veggies....they were a little on the soggy side.\n\n2) tiramisu cup, there was hardly any lady finger in it :( that's the best part!\n\n3) cappuccino mouse, very rich....but a lot of clear brownish fluid was in a pocket in it....not sure if it just wasn't mixed good or what?\n\n4) black beans, they're kind of hard to screw up :)\n\nCould have been okay but.....\n\n1) Chili Relleno. The cheese filling was good, but there was wayyyyy too much breading on it which did nothing but retain too much grease....if there would have been less breading and not as greasy this would have fallen in the category above.\n\n2)peanut butter cream puff. Dry, kind of defeats a \""cream\"" puff.\n\nYuck:\n\n1) crab salad....I don't know if it was imitation crab meat, or old crab... but this was fish and gross...the crab was also rubbery.\n\n2) California roll, ewww gross. I actually spit this out into my napkin. It was so fishy it made me gag a little before I spit it out!\n\n3) mac n cheese pretty bland and gooey....I think maybe they made it with generic velveta?\n\nSo, that's the run down of what I ate, about all I could fit in my tummy. So, in my opinion stick to the peel and eat shrimp and crab :) Not sure about the other meats because I don't eat it.....my hubby said they were okay, not the best, not the worst. He pretty much agrees with me on the \""Meh. I've experienced better\"""
"Sierra Gold is one of the best neighborhood bars.  They give me the VIP treatment every time we visit; a couple of the girls even remember my name.  Their food selection is fantastic.  When Steve, I think he's the bar manager, is there things do tend to run much more smoothly.  If you are a player, they really do take great care of you.\n\nLove the calamari & thin crust pizzas.  They offer the pizza @ 50% off for happy hour from 5-7.  Generous portion of nachos that is difficult to finish.  Good bloody marys - they have their own mix.  You would be surprised at how difficult it is to find good bloody marys around here.\n\nI always have much more fun at SG than I expected.  Good food, good service, & I frequently get lucky @ video poker here."
"This mammoth furniture/homegoods store can be daunting... and you can waste away hours on end in here looking at everything from door knobs to silverware to silverware to lights. **ADVICE-print out a list FIRST, you can do so at www.ikea.com! AND you don't have to go through the showroom/display room first either, you can skip ahead to the \""meat\"" of the store if you just go to the left and/or downstairs from the cafeteria (they have really good food! and it's CHEAP!). \n\nAlso-when you go to write the numbers down off the item you want on your list IN STORE-use the numbers that look like an IP address (example: 201.846.47) and write down the isle and bin numbers... you have to find your items in the warehouse portion before checkout and this makes your life so much easier!!!\n\nWe found some unbelievably good deals and the instructions are so easy to follow to put your new furniture/accessories together! Can't wait to go back and check out their holiday decorations! Love this place!"
"The young people in my life love this place. What is wrong with the youth these days? Their food tastes okay for fast Mexican fare. However every time, without fail, that I have eaten here, I have wound up spending extended time in the bathroom several hours later. Because of that I do not eat there."
"I went there to get my dress hemmed last Wednesday and he said the next Thursday and when I went it to get it the day it was supposed to be done, he hadn't even started and he told me he was working on it right now which was a bold face lie. And when I went back to get it, he charged me for 30 for a simple dress hemming. It is such a rip off. I won't ever go back there."
Good service... But personality wise a little snob'ishhh.\nFood is always AAA.\nGreat place to go with friends n family.
"3rd time to dine here. The service was excellent, the Norwegian Wild Salmon was grilled to perfection. Also, love the way they prepare their Calamari. Everything was great except the Cesar Salad, tasted okay however the lettuce was not crisp and fresh as it should have been for the price.  that is why I gave it four stars."
"I have to say, I was very disappointed with my dining experience at Havana Cafe last night... the place smelled wonderful upon walking in and everything tasted okay (though not as fresh as I would have expected for the price), but I was thrown off-guard by the plastic chairs and frozen fishstick-resembling appetizers!\n\nThe sangria is delectable and, in the moment, I enjoyed the ceviche. However, the tapas sampler was incredibly disappointing... I've traveled throughout the Latin Caribbean and this food did not meet my expectations. \n\nMost importantly, though, I awoke in the middle of the night to horrible cramping, chills, and diarrhea that kept me up for hours. I have strong reason to believe this was food poisoning from the restaurant (given I didn't eat anything else last night) and I have every intention of pursuing a full refund."
This hotel is off the strip and I think all the fun of Vegas is in the heart of the strips so if you are not there then it sucks. It's hard to get around like you have to pay for taxi and everything so I would recommend staying at another hotel in the strip!
"Dressler's is the kind of restaurant I like going to when I feel like having a very nice and very expensive meal, without having to look as if I'm an investment banker that's just made himself another half-billion dollars on the sale of who knows what, and that's my Mercedes S550 that's parked out front.* \n\nI've come here twice now, and both times, I've been knocked off my feet from how outstanding Dressler's is, both to its commitment to fine dining, and the way the staff treats you like an honored guest. Really, they do. Nothing I hate more than being greeted by a surly or condescending host/hostess that shoots you that smug \""You're Abe Froman? The Sausage King of Chicago?\""** look, while giving you grief over your reservation  - actually, we were 10 minutes late, but they weren't too crowded, so they sat us immediately.\n\nLast night was our second visit to Dressler's. We'd been looking forward to coming back after our first visit, which was wonderful in its own right. To our delight, we were offered a table outside. Let me paint the picture for you: you're facing the greenway off Metropolitan Avenue, you have an unfettered view of uptown Charlotte from where you've been seated - and watching the light show on the Duke Tower is truly wonderful - and you couldn't ask for a nicer August evening, free from oppressive humidity. In other words, the perfect spot for a fantastic meal and some people watching.\n\nWe were greeted by our waiter, who identified himself as Johnny Utah***. Seriously. Helpful, attentive, exactly what you want in a waiter.\n\nThe wedge salad is a staple in any fine dining establishment, and their Wedgie is no exception. Yeah, it's a wedge salad, but it's a phenomenal wedge salad. I also sampled their grilled sausage, accompanied by some very tasty arugula. Outstanding.\n\nFor our main course, my wife opted for the ribeye with a side of steamed spinach. The mark of a quality eating establishment can be narrowed down to a simple question: can you grill a good steak? Of course Dressler's can! When you can cut a steak with a fork, you know they're giving you top-quality meats, grilled by someone who knows how to grill a ribeye. She loves their ribeye; it just might be her favorite in town.\n\nI went for the seared Mahi, accompanied by gnocchi and a light lemon vinaigrette sauce. Perfect, in its preparation, its size, and its presentation. Best yet, I hadn't even been in the mood for Mahi, but if it looks good on the menu, then I know it's going to taste even better.\n\nFinally, yes, what you've heard about Dressler's cheesecakes is absolutely true. Best cheesecake in Charlotte, no question about it. Game over, pal. Dressler's cheesecake is the undisputed heavyweight champion. So good was their featured cheesecake - Oreo Cheesecake! - that my wife called it \""pure, concentrated evil that'll make you lose your load.\"" No kidding. I would have ordered a slice of my own, and given myself into such delicious evil.\n\nYou really can't ask for a better dining experience, without the pomp and pretense. Dressler's is fine dining without the snooty (SNOOTY?) or snobby (SNOBBY?) atmospherics.****\n\nWhen a restaurant is better the second time around, you know you've found a keeper. Dressler's is now on my list of Must-Eat Places. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.\n\n\n\n* Actually, it was my Mercedes C350. I prefer modesty over extravagance.\n\n** Ugh. Did I just quote \""Ferris Bueller's Day Off?\""\n\n*** \""Point Break\"" just so happened to be on last night. Of course I watched it.\n\n**** Ugh. Did I just quote \""Ferris Bueller's Day Off\"" again?"
"MONTE CARLO, an awesome name brand.We asked for a non-smoking room and we were sent into a SMOKING ROOM.I noticed that the carpet floor near the window had a minor crack.The room was NOT clean.The hotel was not nice because it is old.I will never stay in this hotel again and this hotel made me wonder why MGM Mirage made horrible hotels and never keep the old ones clean for there customers.Also,MGM's customer service need improvements.Stay at the Monte Carlo if you want a bad stay and want a feel of BARFED OUT EUROPE.This hotel is Sub-standard and below average.\n\n\nMonte Carlo,a great name,and a great disappointment."
"I'm on a hunt for a new sushi place, so I drove 40 minutes to go check this place out.  My review is strictly on their food.   I drove that far, because I trusted Yelp reviews on this place.  What a disappointment it turned out to be...\n\nYes, they have the abalone,  and otoro which I can't find in many other places in AZ...but that's about it.  Their cut on sashimi is poor, meaning, the sashimi chef's skill is not up to par.  The fish is cut too thin, and is jagged at the edges.  Everything is over priced for what it is.  I've had much better other places such as Gilbert of all places!  \n\nI'm all for paying top dollar if what you serve me is top notch!  But this place just isn't worth it!"
"Huge Menu, Friendly People, Good Food.  I really like oregano's for their wide selection.  I took my date here in lieu of cooking (unfortunate bill issues left me with no gas for a few days) and she ordered the ravioli and I got the BBQ chicken thin crust pizza.  It was really flavorful and I enjoyed it.  The only downside (which cost them that fabled 5 stars) was the fact that it is strictly call ahead seating.  This place gets BUSY... and when it gets busy the wait can be pretty bad because all of their food is made from scratch (you can taste it).  Other than that... fantastic meal and get the desert cookie thing they have.  SOOO Good!"
"I keep coming back here for their burgers but their drinks seem to be a miss which seems weird for a brewery.  I think they keep trying to be \""unique\"".  Beers have been warm, cocktails are a huge miss.  I've tried several different ones.  One I deemed the worse drink I've ever had.  Even my husband couldn't drink it.  I didn't see it on the menu this last visit, maybe they realized it was bad.  It was a mix of 4 things which included their signature beer but none of them blended.  Awful.  This last visit I just wanted a house margarita.  Everyone can make a margarita, right?  Turns out it was their san-tan arita which had an IPA mixed into it.  Sigh.  That would explain the color and flavor I didn't enjoy.  We happened to go on a game night and they shut off sound to the game so the live performer could set up.  I love that they give performers a chance but felt bad for the guy that was victim to bad timing.  Maybe don't sign up a performer on game nights.  Choose sports OR live performance.  \nBut back to the 4 starts.  Their food has been great.  I crave their burgers AND fries.  I'll just plan on not ordering any of their drinks from now on."
"I had signed up for the Pizza Dough rewards program to get a free starter. That was nice since it was my first visit.  Both the hostess and our server were pleasant and never left us hanging so they got an extra star there.\n\nThe food, however, was bland.  The mushroom pizza I ordered was served with white truffle oil, but sadly even the strong, aromatics truffle oil could not save the pizza underneath it.\n\nMy brother ordered the fish tacos.  This sadly was nothing to write home about either.\n\nOur friend told us some of the other food was better.  However, my brother and I ordered items that we would normally love on other menus.  That said, we probably won't be returning to CPK."
"Saw the LA Galaxy and Real Madrid soccer game there last night... The game was great, but the stadium could use some work.  Make sure you bring an extra amount if patience as you will wait in concession lines for a half hour and deal with quite possibly the worst parking exit strategy I have ever seen.  I was seriously concerned for the safety of my car and myself. Great game, but come prepared with extra hours of time and life saving patience."
"I hate to give something related to Boys & Girls Club less than 3 stars, but I just wasn't impressed.  While BGC is a great organization, my first experience with them was with the flyer they leave at your house announcing the next date they will be in your neighborhood to pick up.  I left my stuff curbside with the flyer as requested and the truck never came by.  This could explain why the thrift shop was not so great.\n\nThe thrift shop is okay, but the pricing scheme is completely off.  For every item that is priced appropriately, there are two that aren't.  I know it's a charitable organization, but I'm not going to pay near retail for someone else's crap when  I can go to IKEA or Target and get my own brand new crap for almost the same.  Amidst all the crap, however, my mom managed to find a big pile of non-crap that she's \""going to make a profit on.\"""
"What a monumental shithole Treasures.\n\nCover charge at 4:30 in the afternoon was $33.00. Almost immediately upon entering you're besieged with hustling bitches trying to shake you down for table dances at twenty bucks a pop. Should you decline, they'll step up their marketing skills by offering you a package of five dances for only one-hundred dollars. \nGod, they're clever. I think that works out to, oh wait, twenty dollars a dance.\nAs I said, clever.\n\nWhen servers ask for your drink order, they'll immediately ask how you're going to pay for it, suggesting perhaps you may be homeless and without funds for such a wondrous event. \nThe look on your face suggests you're experiencing a wtf moment. \n\n          \"" Cash or credit card?\"" she annoyingly barks while you're still in disbelief.\n\nShaken down at the door, now insulted, as if you were going to swill down a beer and beeline it for an awaiting cab without paying, you begin to reassess if any of this was worth it.\n\nWhether your response is cash or credit, they'll demand payment up front prior to taking the order. I believe this is because, and this is only conjecture mind you, their default statement is to not trust anyone who graces their shit hole establishment for fear they're part shit hole too. It's a projection thing I guess.\n\nDon't get suckered into a VIP dance in the back room by one of the many fleeting nubiles promenading about.. They're there for one reason. To take you to the 'back room'.\nIf you do get suckered into a back room dance, the fee starts at $100 with a $32 two-drink minimum, again, all paid up front of course. And god help you if you happen to get caught up in the moment, losing count of your five song 'deal'. The sixth song just shot the price up to $250 along with a now $50 two-drink minimum. \nIt's like being penalized for getting caught up in the music and whirling tits!\n\nYou're now knee-deep in the shit, having unwittingly purchased the multi-dance package and guess what? This time, the dancer doesn't shake you down for loot, she waltzes you over to some guy bigger than all outdoors, whose tone of voice is lower than a 30\"" subwoofer and whose countenance is that of a guard at Buckingham Palace.\n\n   \""Two hundred fifty bucks pal, how you gonna pay?\"" \n\nI panic.\nThe eighth song just began playing and I don't know what the rules are. The seventh shot the price from twenty to thirty-five. After everything I've seen thus far, I'm thinking they're going to ask me to pony up a nut when song number eight begins playing.\nI cut my losses and head for the door.\n\nWhen you've had enough of their bullshit and want to take a cab back to the hotel, guess what, no cabs. \nOh there are cabs, a cab line and a valet, but you're not going anywhere...not just yet. \nThat's because you'll need to grease the valet, this or else wait in a terminally long line of losers who didn't have money to line the valet's pockets.\n\nHere's what I did.\nI saw an off-duty cab about 100 yards from their driveway entrance and started toward it.\n\n   \""HE'S OFF DUTY!\"" the valet shouts. \n\n    \""FUCK YOU,\"" I respond politely. \n\nI offered the taxi driver a fifty to take me anywhere as fast as he could. This so I could begin erasing the entire shitty experience out of my memory. \nHe declines, saying he'll get in trouble with va-ray. (Asian)\nI make it a Franklin.\n\n  \"" Hop in\"" he says.\n\nEverything about Treasures smells to high heaven, including the plethora of Russian whores in cheap perfume and glitter. You'll know who they are immediately.\nThey speak with the same dialect as that ugly bitch from Rocky & Bullwinkle.\n\nI would only come back here if I won the lottery."
"Clearly worth 4 stars! One of the best sushi restaurants in the valley! It's better than Ra but not better than Sushi Roku. The service was also excellent. The waitresses are beautiful but friendly and didn't give off that trite Scottsdale \""I'm too good to work here\"" vibe. \n\nThe prices were not cheap. If anyone pretends this is affordable sushi, they are lying or stupid. We had a party of 4 and spent $130 including drinks. We only ordered maki rolls too. That same meal at Ra would have been less than a $100. It's not the most expensive sushi restaurant in the valley but it's not \""affordable or inexpensive\""\n\nThe only real knock on the place was it's claustrophobic atmosphere. This place is terrible for big groups. It's an ideal couples restaurant. We had 4 people and felt like our group was too big. There isn't much seating but they did their best to accomodate us. The restaurant is really narrow. \n\nI would recommend this restaurant but only for couples and for those willing to spend over $80 if you are going to eat and drink alcohol."
DO NOT EAT HERE.  They changed my tip and charged me $28 for lunch.  Absolutely ridiculous.
"Simply the best ramen in Scotland, chasu ramen all the way."
"I didn't want to yelp about this spot as I always called it my families little secret. But with the line and obivously the huge amount of reviews, it is no secret.  \n\nThis is a stop EVERYTIME I am in Vegas. Food is just amazing. Yeah yeah, Palace Station. I thought that the first time too. But this place is crazy delicious. Half dozen oysters for me with splitting something and that fills me up. \n\nI know I have had the gumbo, jumbalya, etoufee and I want to say I tried something else the last time I was in town but cant remember what it was. However I know my girlfriend looked at me with a food smile I have never seen.  She loved it! \n\nMake it a stop everytime you are in Vegas. Just hope your luck is used on the tables and not showing up here when there is no line."
"I ordered pizza for pickup, once I arrived home I realized there was hair in my food. I simply called back to this location and asked for a remake and for them to deliver it to me. I didn't think this was to much to ask considering it wasn't my fault. I was told that's wasn't an option (all while being super rude) and when I asked to speak with the manager was told there wasn't one even tho when I picked up my pizza I clearly saw a man with a solid red polo shirt on which was different from the rest. They need to work on customer service."
I dig this place. They give you a decent sized salad and these dangerous fried chips with a sweet sauce I pretty much drown anything I order in. The prices are great and they give you a decent amount of food. I don't go for the atmosphere because there really isn't one but the prices are cheap the food is good and the service is quick. They get a thumbs up.
"I've attended this bowl game twice. Both times, I left a little into the fourth quarter. Both times, some insane, game-changing play went down about the time I hit the parking lot. \n\nPoint is: you can pretty much count on a good game and it's not an outrageous ticket price. \n\nTip: take the next day off or make arrangements to go into the office late, so you don't have to worry about a late night out watching football and you can stick around for all the action!"
"I see a lot of four stars...perhaps I'm too generous with my five stars. I'm a giver.\n\nAttended a party for Georgie on Friday night and had a great time. \nEasy to find, easy to park, easy to get a drink. \n\nPlus- HEY they have the same turbo nozzle a/c vents that I have in my home. I could live there. Exposed brick? Me too! Felt right at home.\nI love the way they display their art, I'm assuming from local artists. \n\nI would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking. However, no problems there - thankfully. :)"
"We came here on a Wednesday night and waited for about 20 minutes and I wish we would have just gone to the buffet!\n\nAfter eating our appetizer which came out in a timely manner, we waited another 20 minutes for one of our two entrees.  While waiting, we noticed that there was a large Chinese family who sat 10 minutes after we did. They placed their order in their native tongue to the waitress and received all of their order. We were really disappointed, we had anticipated eating the sweet sour chicken with the chicken chow mein. Our waittress never came to apologize that the chicken chow mein wastaking longer than anticipated. When we brought it to the attention of the manager, she said some dishes take longer and my hubby pointed out that the Chinese family had chow mein orders, too, and she couldn't answer us!\n\nSo as we sat, we noticed that customers who spoke Chinese, had special treatment over other nationalities. We talked to a European couple next to us, and they had noticed the same trend. I would be interested to know if this happend to others?\n\nOH, and the food??? I would give it 3 stars!! Had better, elsewhere!"
"Can't believe it's taken me this long to check out Bistro La Bon for brunch. I remember see this place come to the odd strip mall and thought it would never amount to nothing. I am pleasantly and utterly incorrect. Bistro La Bon is a culinary force to be reckoned with and has earned every bit of my palate's attention. \n\nFirst of all, these guys are making their own bread every day. For everything. making baguettes and brioche isn't easy to do when you have a shining menu to go along with it. It's labor intensive and has to be done right. Happy to say these guys deliver hand over fist with flavor. \n\nLove the decor, too. It's not to stuffy like some other French restaurants. It's small-ish, but the bar can seat quite a few people. Also, the waiting area is ridiculously comfortable. Try not to fall asleep here on a Sunday afternoon. Or do. \n\nBrunch is just amazing. Swedish meatballs, brisket, au gratin potatoes, salad, plenty of bread, chocolate waffles, eggs, bacon, and..... dun dun dun....the best freaking brioche french toast I've ever had in my entire life. This french toast is perfect. Simply perfect. Not overtly sweet. Just enough sweet/fermenty taste of brioche, modest amount of syrup, homemade whipped cream. It's grilled on the flat top with just the right amount of charred bits. Goodness. Save room for these as they can be ordered from your server. Get ready to eat a baker's dozen. \n\nThe service is fantastic. Knowledgeable and friendly. All you need. \n\nFor $18 a head, I have to say this rivals brunch from many other places in town. I've heard it can be hard to get a seat at peak brunching hours. We made it in at 130pm and didn't have a problem. \n\nI can't wait to go back."
"It has to be said - I am the Wife of a Sports Fan.  We eat at sports bars.......a Lot.\n\nThis place is clean, the seating is comfortable and they have a GREAT basic salad (fresh spring greens, that thin shredded cheese, lovely sliced cukes and crunchy croutons) with the BEST ranch dressing - I mean creamy, rich, full-bodied Ranch!\n\nSo I can dig into whatever appetizer he orders and look forward to the Salad chaser!  \""He\"" said \""everything\"" when I asked what he liked on their menu!  There you go!"
"I came here with several folks and we got cocktails, shots, steaks of all sorts, and some sides.\n\nThe steak is legiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!! I shared the NY 16oz with the booface and I don't know if we were starving or if the steak was just THAT amazing but we couldn't stop salivating even at the last bite of medium rare heaven. I tried some of the other people's filets which which also mouth watering.\n\nThe sides (creamed spinach, potatos, asparagus, mac n'cheese) were also good though the meat was definitely the star of the show.\n\nOther mentionables: friendly service with a waitress with nice arms and strong cocktails. The price is hefty but you kinda realize that going to a place like this in Vegas."
ordered 2 carnita tacos with rice/beans. The food was cold and everything was flavorless. The food was gross and super expensive. Maybe the actual restaurant is better.
"Service is non-existent, rude if any and racially discriminatory. Basically if you do not look Chinese or are not Chinese the people who work here are extremely rude.\n\nMy husband (1/2 Chinese 1/2 Swedish) and I (100% Chinese) came here with our son (1 year old) for an early dim sum lunch. We have been coming to Chang's since 2004 but the restaurant is now under new ownership. We experienced the WORST, actually it was NON EXISTENT service. The hostess was rude when she seated us. She brought over 2 forks, ignored me when I said we do not need them and then slammed them onto our plates and walked away.\n\nWhen we complained to the manager he told us the restaurant workers bring forks to Americans. This in itself is racial discrimination/profiling, seriously who doesn't know how to use chop sticks?!?!? Do Japanese restaurants bring \""Americans\"" forks? Do Italian restaurants bring Asian customers chop sticks? \n\nWhen it came time to pay our bill the same hostess who seated us point blank ignored our raised bill in the air and purposely did not take it. At this point my husband walked over to her and tapped her on the back to give her the bill. She continued to ignore him and refused to turn around. He tapped her again with the bill in his had and she again ignored him. When she finally turned she looked at the bill in his hand and refused to take it, letting it drop to the floor when he handed it to her. At this point another restaurant employee came over and asked why the hostess did not take the bill. The hostess walked away and acted like it was not her job. When the other restaurant employee picked up the bill and came over to our table I asked her if the hostess is responsible for taking bills and ringing them up, she responded yes.\n\nWhen we complained to the owner of the restaurant he said my husband should not have tapped the hostess on the back. Uuuuummm really? How else am I supposed to get a workers attention so they can DO THEIR JOB? Instead of being apologetic or recognizing the blatant discrimination the owner and the manager of the restaurant blamed us the customers for being a problem. \n\nI will never come to this restaurant again and believe what comes around goes around. The food is mediocre at best and the service does not exist. We are from San Francisco and have never been treated in such a manner at any Chinese or Asian restaurant."
This is a outdoor shopping area.  Great shops.  Beautiful spot to stop for brunch and then go shopping!!!  Great addition to Vegas to get away from the Strip!
"One word can sum up my stay here:  Amazing!!! \n  I've been to Vegas several time but Caesar's ranks as my favorite! The service was stellar!.Every time I called the front desk to ask a question, I was addressed by my name. I was here for a conference and lucked out with an upgrade to the Augustus tower Jr. suite, thank you!!\n\nLocation is perfect with lots of shopping at the Forum shoppes tons of dining options!!\nHuge pool, casino, everything. Let's be honest, Caesar's is massive!! Right in the middle of the strip, plenty of action all around!!\n\nThank you Caesar for an awesome experience!"
"Small local restaurant, but cheap price, good food, and lovely owner sing a song for you."
Tried the Friday Seafood Buffet for the first time. I was disappointed in the quality of most of the seafood.  The scallops were the tiny bay variety.  The crab legs are small and not worth the effort. Shrimp dishes were average.  The highlight was the two red snapper dishes.  The seafood buffet is about $10 more than the regular buffet and it replaces some of the best meat dishes with substandard seafood options.
"over-hyped TGI Fridays.\n\nAte here on a business dinner while in Phoenix.  It was not a memorable experience and I would recommend that anyone considering going here takes a look at anywhere else nearby.  Five-Guys burgers would be a better bet.\n\nSorry, not a place I would like to return to"
"We live literally across the street and have been wanting to come here for a year since moving in. We did last night, and it was great.\n\nBefore ever visiting, Louisiane has a really lovely vibe, candlelit seats spread along the sidewalk. It always looked very enticing, and it was, both inside and out.\n\nThe menu is southern/cajun food, which was a first for us, which was nice. We ordered a chicken soup, green salad, crab cakes, to start. And then we had the dinosaur beef ribs and sizzling firecracker shrimp as mains. We also got two bottles of wine.\n\nEverything was really yummy, the chicken soup/green salad were good. The crabcakes / dinosaur ribs though, were amazing. The crabcakes starter comes as 5-6 small little balls which you can dip and eat. And the ribs, were honestly, some of the best I ever had in my life. \n\nAlso, all of the staff were also super nice. I say all, because unlike other restaurants where if you ask another employee for something, they will say \""I'll get your server.\"" At Louisiane, said person just did the task, happily. Which is how it is in the Europe/Australia, unlike North America etc. \n\nWe had a really lovely dinner. Every aspect was great.\n\nHowever, the one downside to this place, is that I find it is a tad expensive. Most things on the menu feel a little bit marked up than they should be, I feel. But that said, unlike many other marked up restaurants around the city, La Louisiane offers something that is incredibly unique, and executed very well. For a long time, we only stuck to going to BYOW restaurants if we ever wanted wine, because of the intense markup on bottles especially. However, because Louisiane is unique, and offers a great seating, atmosphere and food, it can be argued that the pricing is justified. I'd return for sure."
"A friend of mine was just talked into joining this gym last week. 18 year old who hadn't experienced the classic \""gym\"" sales crap.\nAFTER they accpeted his membership fee and first and last.. THIS GYM IS SHUTTING DOWN in TWO WEEKS!! What a joke! \n\nSo everyone was correct in their previous posts that this place should shut down but they shouldn't have accepted any memberships knowing they were closing in two weeks."
"Oh my goodness what is that magnified yet terrifying tuning noise that continuously rang throughout the weekend from 4am to 6am in the morning?!?!! My goodness!!\n\nBut besides thats, the Veer Towers is great! Three full bedrooms, three full bathrooms, and everything was so sleek modern, I loved the wide open space windows that not only gave us the view of Marquee Day Club, but the Bellagio water show and Paris' Eiffel Tower, making it a one spectacular view.  We had a flat on the 27th floor which was a rented flat to guests. I will note that I was a little taken back that a blow dryer was no where to be found, simply because, well, any rented flat or a hotel I've stayed at provided that particular vanity amenity. Thank goodness that I did pack one in hand ahead of time, otherwise! I loved that the kitchen was large and spacious, and I was even surprised there had a Bodrum french coffee press, a true plus!\n\nThe Veer Towers is located in the City Center next to the Aria and Cosmopolitan. As I had mentioned above regarding the eerie tuning nose, apparently, the Veer Towers is known for this misfortune and just wasn't constructed correctly. The tuning is caused by the high winds that blow through the towers next to the other hotels, but The Veer seemed to get hit the most with the strenuous tune.\n\nBut I kid you not regarding that loud tuning noise, I was seriously terrified that evening and I felt like we had UFO's around us, that's how intense it was.\n\nHowever, besides the noisy ruckus, I loved it, and would love to stay here again, just hopefully under a much windless weekend x"
"Wasn't too impressed with this restaurant. I heard you could build your own creations similar to a Subway style place. They had 3 options of meat, none of which were my favorites, one type of cheese and very limited extras. The girl rolling the burrito was extremely slow at doing so-took her forever to roll it up. I worked at a Mexican restaurant and know it does not take this long!! THe line got really long due to her. The staff was really friendly and nice and they patrolled the drink bar very well, keeping it stocked and cleaned. Overall, they tried hard, but the concept was lacking at best. I won't be back."
"Ok this is no longer my favorite PTs. I would come here after work to relax and enjoy a drink. I don't have that same enjoyment of this place anymore.\n\nRewind back a few months. My bf and I came here one night for a few drinks. I order a Bellini, which is champagne and peach pur\u00e9e. The bartender Carla didn't know what that was and made this face like I was making up some absurd drink. It's a typical champagne cocktail! And plus you're a bartender, you're supposed to know your drinks. She knew what a mimosa was when I ordered it, she should have known what a Bellini was. Anyway, about 10 minutes later, my bf accidentally knocked over my drink shattering the glass on the floor. We thoroughly apologized and I understand that Carla was annoyed she had to clean it. \n\nNow fast forward to our visit last night. We order a beer from this one blonde bartender. Really nice and inviting. We were enjoying our time. Then Carla comes over and says to my bf \""do you want another beer?\"" Then he answered \""sure I'll take another one.\"" Then she replies with \""what is it?\"" Um rude!!! My bf said she probably remembered us from the glass breaking incident, which is why she have us attitude. Anyway, after that I was just in a fowl mood and we left shortly after. \n\nLooks like I won't be going to this PTs anymore. There's another one down the street from us so it's not like I'm going out of my way."
"I love the mint chocolate chip! Real mint leaves instead of imitation flavoring. The peppermint is fabulous also! Really, you can't go wrong."
"Does the management not check their Yelp account? Because it seems like that they STILL haven't done anything about the terrible service. \n\nJezabel, or whatever her name was, took my order over the phone & answered impatiently to my questions with \""YEA.\"" \""OKAY.\"". I figured they were busy so I brushed off her snooty attitude...until SHE HUNG UP ON ME WITHOUT EVEN ASKING FOR MY NAME OR EVEN SAYING BYE.\n\nAnother time I came in there were two workers in the kitchen chatting away & laughing obnoxiously while they saw me standing in the front, all while I was in a rush. Then after I got my smoothie it was tasteless. No taste of fruit whatsoever. I thought it was just mine, but other people who got a smoothie from the same location said they had the same crappy, tasteless smoothie. \n\nI usually come here because it's convenient for me, but I've had it. I am never coming back to this horrible location.\n\nI wish Yelp gave the option to not give any stars."
Nice rooms but I'd only return I'd there was a coffee maker in the room. If the want you to get up and gamble they shouldn't make guests wait in the 40 + people long line at either Starbucks for overpriced drip !
"I saw Dr. Samuel-Parks at the Mahomet location to discuss weight loss medication. I am a veterinarian myself, and I have completed nearly identical medical education to her. I expected some level of professional courtesy, or at the very least not treating me like a layperson. Dr. Samuel-Parks was condescending and dismissive. She told me right off the bat: \""I don't believe in diet pills.\"" She patronized me, told me to stop drinking sugary coffee drinks (I don't. I hate them. I drink my coffee black. She just assumed I drink 700 calorie frappes.). She didn't even perform a full physical on me. Then I got a bill for $130 for five minutes of being talked down to and a TPR. I found another doctor who actually listened to me, treated me like an intelligent person, and with a diet and exercise program and a phentermine prescription I've lost 20 lbs."
Do not order the all you can eat cod fish fry . Its horrible it was cold and mushy so I sent back and it came back the same terrible! My wife ordered  ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel it was was cold when it came they also brought it back I suspect they just microwaved it . The server was apologetic and didn't charge for the cod. Very disappointing!!
"This place turned to crap.  I remember when it first opened I loved this place.  I thought it was the best Chinese Food in town.  Flo took so much pride into her recipes.  I am not sure what went wrong.\n\nI can't speak for all the servers there, but ours was terrible.  No personality just a freaking robot.  She came up to the table to greet us by saying \""Are you ready to order\""  How about some drinks lady?  I can get by with horrible service if the food is good, but the food was lousy.\n\nWe ordered chicken lettuce cups, 2 different types of soup and 2 entrees.  They tried to bring the soup out first but I asked them if we could get our app first.  The chicken that came with the lettuce cups was just the fatty pieces of the chicken they don't used with the entree, but all minced up.  The texture was gross and the flavor was bland.  The soups were the only reason this review got 2 stars.  Pretty good.  Wife had wonton soup and I had seafood shelfish soup.  \n\nThe entrees sucked.  We shared Crispy Spicy Chicken which was more like Soggy Salty Chicken and the Orange Beef which was decent but soggy which made it not as good.  The server never came by again therefore I went the whole meal without anything to drink.\n\nFor sure we will not be coming back anytime soon.  I am not sure why this place stays busy, it's not worth my time.  If I wasn't so hungry, I would have returned the entrees and app."
"Let's start by saying that \""Tradiciones\"" no longer exists and now the place is called \""Mariscos Vuelve La Vida\"".   The Spanish translation to this phrase is \""Seafood gives Life\"".   Ironically, this is what this restaurant is missing... life.  Made the mistake of taking some out of town relatives to eat here.  One in the party had been here before when it was Tradiciones and fell in love with the patio and the \""Mexicaness\"" of it all.  Is Mexicaness a word?  I don't think so but I like it.   We ordered fried tilapia, fried red snapper, two chicken quesadillas, one carne asada platter, one chicken burrito, one Modelo Negro beer and one margarita.  All the dishes were accompanied by a fake yellow rice and refried beans.  These have to be addressed first.  I say fake yellow rice because they were trying to make the typical mexican rice but failed.  The rice was plain, saltless white rice with a few peas in it.  A mexican place that doesn't know how to make a flavorful yellow rice?? Shame, shame muchachos.  What a flavorless scoop of I don't know what!  Really?  I told the cook I would gladly come by free of charge and teach the cooks how to make really really good yellow rice but she just listened and then said she would tell the cook.  \nAnd now for the refried beans.  Mushy, flavorless, saltless something.  If I had had a blindfold I NEVER would have guess I was eating beans.  Beans can be soooo delicious made with tender loving care and seasoned properly with garlic, onions and yes...something called salt.  \nThen for the carne asada, AKA, shoe leather.  Thin slices of beef with NO salt or pepper, or any seasoning for that matter.  Telling the waitress that it was overcooked and tough when she asked how the food was did not help.  She just walked away.  Was she muttering \""that's how we always make it\"" under her breath as she walked away?  The two fried fish dishes lacked salt, were overcooked and a tad greasy.  The quesadilla & burrito were passable but nothing  worth a return visit.  However, the MODELO NEGRO beer was EXCELLENT and that's how this restaurant earned its ONE star rating.  \nBTW, the chips were fresh and plentiful.  So if you want to go to a restaurant just for chips and water, you are good to go at this place.\nMARISCOS VUELVE LA VIDA, contrary to its name, will be on its last legs shortly. We should start calling the EMT's now and give it some mouth to mouth.  It is going to need it."
We had the Travel Zoo coupon which gives you the app/entree/dessert. Ordered the combo app of course. Alligator was tough and so were the frog's legs. Crabcake was great. Gumbo is good. jambayala was great...Not quite New Orleans but pretty tasty. Atmosphere was nice and New Orleans looking. Large portions for the money.
"Name of establishment Village Bistro\n                      14185 John J. Delany Drive, Ste 150\n                      Charlotte, NC 28277\n                      704-369-5190\n\nOwners we contacted: Gary Murray, Lars Johnson\n\n\nDate of occurrence: October 31, 2006\n\nBallantyne Area of Charlotte NC-Village Bistro.\nAte there 3 times. First time when opened. Quite good and service was attentive. Owner came by to ask how things were.\n\nSecond time fair but I like to give places the benefit of the doubt. Could be an off night.\n\nWas wrong on third time when Fianc' were out celebrating a special event and we both ordered the same thing. We both got sick. She became very ill and had to spend the rest of the next day indoors. Doctor diagnosed this as food poisoning over the phone and gave her some instructions on what to do.\n\nWe informed restaurant who denied that such a thing could occur within 4 hours of after eating. PLEEEZE.\n\nWe spoke to one of the owners who took down some information and said she would mail a check of some amount to reimburse us for the $72 meal. Check never received.\n\nWe wrote the two owners a letter via postal mail. No luck, no response.\n\nI have been told that if this ever happens again to immediately call your doctor like we did. Then call the Board of Health within a day or two. Found this second part out a bit late.\n\nI also learned to use my charge card in restaurants rather than pay cash. Then I can cancel with good reason.\n\n\nVillage Bistro--no more!! However we may send friends there we do not like so they can experience poor service, false promises, denial and just need to clear out their bodily fluids.\n\nPeter"
"Nascar weekend, 1 shuttle running from TSA to gates, no very smart.  Almost missed my flight.  Also on a time change day.  Your killing me."
"Well worth the drive.  This off the strip hotel is truly for locals but always welcomes out of towners.  Give this buffet a try, you wont be disappointed. Excellent service and a variety of food - good to satisfy anyones palate."
"We sat in Main Deli Steak House having an outstanding smoked meat sandwich (and poutine), watching people lined up across the street when we knew from our experience the day before that it wasn't worth it over there and ordered another smoked meat from Main Deli because they were so damned good and the experience was what we needed for our last night in Montreal before flying out to Vancouver the next morning. Thank you, Main Deli Steak House, a la prochaine."
"This is a shiny new facility that is still undergoing some finishing touches. Overall, this was a great idea to consolidate all companies in to one central and customer friendly facility. Hopefully all airports offer this kind of service some day.\n\nThe shuttle location from the airport was very easy to locate, was constantly boarding people on to buses, and got people to and from the center quickly. Once at the facility, it was very easy to find where to go, get checked in, and off the the garage where a car would be ready and waiting to be picked up."
This was a great show Wally the MC was the highlight. Worth the price I loved every minute
Having car problems is already bad enough. Labor was expensive but expected for a franchise. Customer service on the other hand was awful.
"First of all the only reason it gets the one star is the waitress. I can't remember her name but she was great! Now to the review. To start off there was little to no wait which was great. The hostess staff is pretty rude and not very helpful at all!I was in a party of 10, we asked for a table that was open closer to the buffet and she said no because she was going in line to who got there and we were not first. Well um you were seating us right then so yes I would say we were first! Carrying on..\n\nWhen I got up to the buffet I was amazed by how much stuff was there. My first choice was the blackened salmon. HUGE MISTAKE as it was pretty raw! It was terrible!! I grabbed a few other items that were pretty sub par too. The sushi was also warm and tasted terrible!! After almost gagging on that plate I figured I would hit up the crab and shrimp. First piece of crab I grabbed was covered in curly hair! Now I know this crab did not get a Jerry curl after being killed so someone forgot their hairnet! YUCK YUCK YUCK!! the other pieces I took were rubbery and tasted pretty bad. Shrimp was OK. Prime rib was my next stop after. I was hoping to say something good about that but with the salt content on  it I just can't :( There was really not a whole lot I can say I enjoyed here. I left feeling gross and mad that I had paid well over $100 bucks for this crap!! I tried to speak to a manager but the hostess told me to get over it and leave. I did not even have a chance!! When I tried to explain that I was feeling sick and that my friend got up several times during our meal to get sick she told me to stop whining and leave already! I have worked in hotels and as a hostess at a buffet before and have never in my life would i ever dream of talking to someone like that!! \n\nTerrible just Terrible! Next time I am in Vegas this is one place I will not be going back to!!"
"Came here for lunch, so my review is base on lunch experience. First of all, I definitely recommend reservation, because it will cut out the wait time. Second, try to pick a sunny day to come because the view is awesome. DATE alert!!! If you wanna impress a girl on a first date, I definitely recommend this place. Now get back to the food and service. The food portion was decent and actually good. The service was very good also. The price is actually not bad when you think about the location and view."
"Best.time.ever! We did the Black Canyon horseback riding experience that included a BBQ. Our guide, Aaron, was a REAL cowboy! Loved it! Spent over 20 years handling horses from CO to AZ and back. He had on his cowboy hat, boots with spurs, plaid shirt with Marlboro reds in his pocket, and Wrangler jeans. My son was so happy at the authentic experience. He got to shoot a real pistol, lasso, throw a tomahawk, etc. Did you know they have a Cowboy camp? Yep. Awesome.\nThey offer the same experience in Sedona, so we can't wait to try that one."
"I love plain cheese pizza. I love a crunchy yet soft crust, good melty cheese, and a not-too-sweet sauce. Napoli had all three, but where they fell short, which surprised me, was the taste of the crust, it was way too salty. I don't know if it was because it went bad or they didn't measure the salt correctly but I was very disappointed. I loved everything else about the pizza so I hope this was a one-time thing. I will give them another chance but I will buy a single slice next time instead of a whole pie."
"Went to Eddie's House last night to celebrate my dad's 70th birthday.  Overall a great experience.  We arrived a little before our reservation time but were seated promptly.   We were quickly greeted by the server and she was able to answer any questions we had about the menu.   There were four in our party and the items we ordered were:  mint pesto lamb chops, hummus platter, iceberg wedge salad, diver scallops, meatloaf, new york strip, chicken with the asiago creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes.  We also had a great bottle of cabernet suggested by the server (I forgot the name, however, but it was one of their specialty wines).    We also had pre-dinner cocktails and I had their Mai-Tai.    It was one of the best I've ever had.  The food was very good quality and not too salty.   The only complaint by some of our party members were that the lamb did not have enough mint flavor (I don't eat lamb so I did not try them).   The iceberg wedge did not have enough carmelized onions or blue cheese dressing and crumbles.  We had to ask for extra blue cheese and were charged an extra fee.   These are the only reasons for the four stars.  Overall a good experience.   It would have been better if Eddie visited our table.  He was there and visited with most of the tables but not ours.    We're not sure why.   We were in a corner, maybe he couldn't make it over that far.   Overall a great place and I would go back.   Nice atmosphere too."
"Umm, no thank you. This was definitely the worst eating experience I have had in Las Vegas. I ordered a club sandwich, which I understand is not their specialty, but I didn't have huge expectations. The sandwich was huge but not layered at all. Huge pile of turkey covered in bread, huge pile of bacon, wedge of iceberg lettuce. Basically ingredients that you have to assemble yourself. Oh and did I mention it cost $27. Ultimately had to complain to the manager about my disappointment.\n\nAnnnddd, my friend did get the pastrami which was also not very good."
Service sucks. They are always messing up orders and are rude to customers. One of their workers was just yelling at a kid for bringing in his skateboard and told him to have consideration. So rude and unprofessional.
"The cigars are pretty damn near dried out. Some of their better ones are marked up a bit too high. Really? An Arturo Fuente Hemingway Short Story for 11 bucks?! Tasting Room has them for about 7. Consider than the walk in humidor isn't well maintained, it's certainly not worth the extra $4 they charge for a relatively short/quick smoke.\n\nThe staff is nice, and they have a pretty good selection of smoking tobaccos and wares, but they gotta do something bout dem see-gars."
This was my first time trying Culvers. It's nothing special and is comparable to Wendy's or any other fast food burger place.
"So happy to have this in the neighborhood! I've been there several times and not been disappointed once. I can see how Jennifer has been a long-time successful caterer. \n\nThe Cuban sandwich is plentiful and delicious. The asparagus, burratta, and prosciutto salad is a nice light offering but still satisfying. Butternut squash soup hit the spot. I enjoyed the fresh shrimp po boy - the shrimp was not fried - which made it feel healthier.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the nosh boards, the corn chips are nothing special and the combination is a bit weird.  \n\nDo try the brownie cookies, you will not regret it."
"Perfect.  The best $200 I have ever spent on an aromatherapy massage. Done by a world class therapist named, Jodi!  The decor is like being in a plush, extravagant dream.  I love you, Encore spa."
"Popcorn Girl has 2 locations: one in Summerlin and one in Henderson.  This Summerlin  location is in a strip mall, which is easy to find.\n\nGreat selection.  Great customer service.  They offer free, small samples do you know what you are getting.  You can call ahead and make an order, which if you are in a hurry I recommend.  Once you decide on a flavor, they go to the back to make your selection.  \n\nThey have some funky flavors like dill and cheddar jalape\u00f1o.  They have 4 types classic, chocolate, kettle, and candied.  You can mix and match if you want.  They have homemade fudge and cool bottled drinks, like blue cream soda.  \n\nDefinitely worth a stop.  I will be back!  Perfect snack for the movies!!"
"I have stayed at a number of Harrah's properties and I gamble at Harrah's in order to get the Total Rewards points.  I have never had bad service up until this last weekend when I stayed at Caesers Palace.  We chose Caesers because of its reputation as a top notch property, but let me tell you, this place is nothing more than an overpriced Motel 6 with a nice lobby.  \n\nOur adventure started when we went to check in.  After receiving our room key, we trudged around looking for the appropriate tower, and after about 15 minutes finally found it.  Took the elevator to our room, open the door for my wife and she screams \""Shut the door, there's a lady in the bathroom\"".  We did not feel like dragging our bags back down again to get a new room, so we used the conveniently placed phone to call the front desk.  Unfortunately, after 10 minutes we were still on hold so it's back to the front desk.  The one nice thing was that the desk clerk apologized and gave us a $100 food and beverage credit.  So off to the new room and fortunately this time it was unoccupied.\n\nFor the price these rooms go for on a weekend, we were severely disappointed.  The room had obviously not been refurbished since the hotel was built, and it had signs of severe wear and tear (missing knobs on the dressers, shower doors that did not close all the way, and a front door that had to be pulled shut in order to make sure it locked).  The TV was vintage 1998, and there was no minibar or coffee maker in the room.\n\nAbout the amenities at the hotel , there is not much to say because this hotel has a severe lack of them.  None of the bars serve coffee, only one I could find served draft beer (and no decent drafts), and there is only one place to get breakfast besides the overpriced buffet (more on the buffet later).  Coffee at the cheezy Java Coast was $4.00 for a small.  Even Starbucks doesn't have the audacity to charge that for a brewed coffee.\n\nAs it was a milestone birthday for me, I invited a number of friends to Vegas to have dinner at the Caf\u00e9 Lago Buffet.  For the price, which is way more than most other buffets on the strip, the selection was truly anemic.  One small line of food where most others are 3 times the size.  We had only 12 people but they required us to split our party or pay an 18% gratuity charge.   I'm sorry, but I am not going to pay $6 per person just for someone to refill our iced tea twice.  We asked for tables that were close together, but were told (of course) that if we had the same server we would have to pay the gratuity.  The servers themselves were snotty and obnoxious and told us that \""our union fought hard to get us that\"".  They must have heard my wife say that we weren't going to tip because they proceeded to ignore us.  Really?  You think you deserve a big percentage at an overpriced buffet to bring us our beverages?  The last straw was after our meal was finished, my wife had a tiny piece of cake left which she was going to wrap in a napkin for later.  The waitress saw her and said \""If you take that cake I'll make sure security is waiting for you\"".  \n\nNot only will I never stay at Caesers, I will never stay at, or gamble at another Harrah's property.  If this is the way you treat people at the \""the most prestigious resort in the world\"" and a place with \""Impeccable service\"" (to quote the website), then you really should rethink your corporate culture.  There are plenty of other places that make an effort to keep their customers happy so why should we spend our money with Harrah's?"
"A tip of the hat to their creativity,  effort to source locally, passion for quality, and engaging customer service.  Also, all the other superlatives that were repeated ad nasuem in the other reviews.  \n\nI also like that this place is literally just down the street from the Cold Stone Creamery headquarters.  I wonder how often they have their corporate spies in there."
"About 3 weeks ago I came to this place to eat pho, my experience with pho was really bad..slow down on the MSG, you don't want to kill the customer before they can finished their food and to day I got vietnames upon noodles (banh canh). Do you think all of your customers is stupid. When you say pork,shrimp, and crab the customer expect everything to be included not missing and say that it doesn't come with it. You charge me extra for it, when I can just get the regular for the figure price."
"Are you kidding me? My second time here, first time was last year having tires bought off the internet installed! Great experience. But the reason for the review is what just happened. Pulled into my garage and heard the terriblr hissing of a tire leaking air and fast. Wasnt sure if I'd make it to Tireworks but I did. When I pulled in I jogged for the door and was intercepted by one of the technicians. I explained the problem and by the last sentence my tire was already off. Plugged it, rebalanced it and had it back on before the sleeping newborn woke up! Winning!!! Now for the price... Free! Gratis! zero dollars, nada, zip, bagels, less than 1 cent... you get it! I'll be back for all my tire needs. I realize this wasn't brain surgery or even a big repair but the way it was handled was clutch! I'm the newest Tire Works loyal customer."
"A friend and I stopped here after a movie. Walked in the front door and the place was nearly empty (3:00pm Mother's Day!)\nWe were told we would have to wait fifteen minutes to be seated! Honestly, the place was half full and plenty of tables were available. \nWe asked if we could sit at a small table in the bar area (which was TOTALLY empty) and were told we would have to wait fifteen minutes to be seated.\nA little puzzled, we asked about getting food while sitting at the bar. Hostess told us that would be fine.\nWe decided to leave. Before we left I asked the Hostess , \""Why the wait? The restaurant is half full?\"" \nHer response was, \""Because my kitchen is backed up\"". I said, \""Wait, we can get food without a wait if we sit at the bar, but the kitchen is backed up and you are half full.\"" This does not make sense?\"" She just got mad so we left. Went to Sammy's Pizza in the same area, great food, great service, even a glass of champagne for Mother's Day. We called the manager of TGIF from the restaurant and asked her about the \""wait\"". She told us there was no wait and no back up in the kitchen.\n\""You need to let the hostess know there is no wait\"". Manager did not really care.\nThis place should be packed on Mother's Day-every other eatery on Sunset was packed.\nThis TGIF's is on its way to closing unless the owner gets a grip on his staff. ..Call in the Restaurant Recovery program! This staff is killing what should be a successful franchise!"
Oh No!!!! \nTo begin with twist cap wine-really??\nThere's more produce in the outside window than in the iceberg salad and for my heart attack stuffed potato if it were stuffed it wouldn't have killed a guppy. If you like good beef salud the beef is good the lobster not so much.\nWould not go here again......bye bye bob\nFor that price go to charcoal room
"Had my first Short Leash Dog at the food Truck Friday a few weeks ago and I'm hooked. I had the special, the Mac Daddy- hot dog (I chose the spicy dog) with chili, and MAC AND CHEESE on warm nan bread. DAMN!  I will be frequently their brink and mortar store as soon as they open. So many wieners so little time....  there's a t-shirt in there somewhere :)"
"Don't stay here unless you really have to. There is no internet wifi in the rooms, they give you a short jack to put into the side of your computer... too bad I only had my ipad. Not to mention that the TV channels suck. I would't complain about that if they just had some stinking wifi! I mean why make me pay resort fees for such a shitty hotel? Last but not least, there was a bug in my room my last day I stayed and never been back since. Save some extra cash and go elsewhere."
"Lou. \nYou got me. \nYou got me good. \nSo good, with your classic barbering technique, that I'm even considering coming in sooner than every four weeks. Crazy, I know, but as you get to know my hair I'm digging where things are going. It's a happy relationship we've created been man and razor. (And locks.) And four weeks seems too long to let you hack at it. The remodel brightens this space up and makes it feel like a hair emporium where creativity oozes from stylists hands. I'm a fan."
"Ugh!  I think I am going to be sick!  Please let the record reflect that I did not choose this restaurant.  It was chosen as a meeting place by my sister-in-law sight unseen.  \n\nLocated in kind of a dingy strip mall, the place was pretty full on a Sunday night.  We took this as a good sign.  The staff was friendly and was very good about bringing drink refills and clearing plates.  The restaurant was relatively clean.\n\nLet's get down to the heart of eating out, though, which is FOOD.  The food ranged from unexceptional to bad.  The eggrolls, jalapeno chicken, and fried wantons were not bad, but nothing special.  The coconut shrimp was the best thing  I ate and was actually tasty, but very heavy and greasy.  The hot and sour soup was okay.\n\nDo not be tempted by the sushi.  I am skeptical anytime I see sushi at a buffet, but decided to try it anyway.  It was TERRIBLE!  The one nigiri I had was just awful.  The fish was not fresh and the rice was bland.  The one California type roll was similarly AWFUL.  I hope that sushi virgins are not getting this as their first taste of sushi, because it will turn them off to sushi forever.\n\nThe other items to choose from were standard Chinese buffet fare, but bland and greasy.  Nothing special here.  I was too afraid to try very much.\n\nAfter eating at Great Wall Buffet, I feel cheap and dirty, but I did not even enjoy the experience.  If I am going to be so bad, it had better be so good."
"What a delight!\n\nMy husband and I were in my hometown for Christmas, and ventured out on our third date since the birth of our son.  I was so excited to check out Lawrenceville for the first time, and couldn't wait to show my foodie husband that Pittsburgh can do sophisticated with the best of them.  Before dinner, we stopped at Espresso A Mano because I heard it was the best coffee shop in Pittsburgh.\n\nI was so surprised when we stepped up to the counter and the barista greeted me by my maiden name!  Thirteen years after we were on the high school track team together, Matt recognized me.  Man, he is good with names!  It was fun to catch up, and I'm so proud to see a fellow McKeesport alum being such a success.  \n\nMy decaf, almond milk latte (for my nursing son's benefit) was surprisingly rich in coffee flavor, and was served up without a hint of pretension.  I remember singing along to the music, and loved the exposed brick walls.\n\nGood people.  Good coffee."
I'll give this place A+++++
"I came to the Jean Georges Steakhouse for a group dinner hosted by some guys with whom my firm does a lot of business.  The menu had been preselected with one table-wide appetizer, and three to five choices of soup/salad, entree and dessert.  All of the choices appear on the regular menu. \n\nThe table started with the chilled seafood platter, with an awesome selection of oysters, shrimp, crab claws and crab legs. There were multiple cocktail and other sauces - I'm sure this appetizer cost a fortune, but it was truly extraordinary. \n\nI chose the Burrata Mozzarella (salad), with tomato, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The burrata could have used more salt but it was very fresh and really nice.  Not your average grocery store tomatoes, and good luck finding obviously handmade cheese like this - really nice dish. \n\nHow disappointing then that my medium rare NY Strip Steak was overcooked to at least medium - that shouldn't happen at a Jean Georges restaurant. No red, just a bit of pink in the middle.  The steak also tasted bland. I wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms either.  The mashed potatoes were awesome and probably had as much butter as they did potato.\n\nMy dessert confirmed the steak was an aberration.  The chocolate cake was ridiculous. Not too sweet but just bitter enough and perfectly melty on the inside with a rich ball of ice cream. Excellent. \n\nTwo comments on the service. While it was fantastic overall (they were cool when we lingered after closing time), it was annoying when the staff kept asking whether I was having flat or sparkling water, and then when one didn't ask somebody topped off my flat water with sparkling water - not cool. Then it was annoying when a photographer cajoled us into taking a souvenir photo of the table. Then she wanted $20 for each print.  Really guys?  At Jean Georges?\n\nOverall the dinner was great, and special thanks go to our hosts. Great place."
I really like this restaurant... for the west island. In town it's nothing special. But thank god someone has opened a proper byow in this area. It's my official go to place when my dad wants to eat dinner now. \n\nThe pizzas are great and I've enjoyed the various pasta dishes I've tried. \n\nWord to the wise... This place is actually busy so RSVP.
"Fantastic!  Went there with my boyfriend and some friends for drinks and a bite.  I got a veggie burrito (definitely a thumbs up) and an assortment of drinks, all delicious.  You can tell the bartender cares about what he puts together, and it was fun chatting with him before we ate.  The atmosphere is almost trying too hard, but that really only adds to it's charm, as you notice more and more interesting details as you look around (parachute frogs on the vent, etc).  I'm hoping to stop in again very soon to try their veggie nachos or tacos."
The most amazing experience EVER! I decided to take my boyfriend on a helicopter ride over the Vegas strip at night for his 30th birthday. A limo picked us up at our hotel and then we were the last people to ride for the night. The limo ride and helicopter ride over the Vegas strip at night was the best experience ever!
"I looked into many places before getting my first tattoo and a place to get my following ones. Let me tell you how amazing this gentleman are! I worked right around the corner from there as a manager for cold stone and they are always polite and kind men and respectful. They are all very clean and well groomed. I don't know about you if youd want some grease ball giving you a tattoo with dirty fingers? None of these guys are. They are more than happy to help out any one from their first tattoo to a person whos had them before. At electric haven they make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The owner Adam is an awesome dude, he did mine personally and made sure I was okay the whole time.  After going here I have referred all my friend and family to Electric Haven for Hair cuts and Tattoos. If the amazing tattoos and hair cuts dont get you in, then the free beer might if your 21+. High life on tap for free with cuts and tattoos. Don't let the harshness of how the boys look with the piercings and tattoos scare you, they are all the sweetest guys ive met. They make you smile and laugh your ass off while your there."
"This buffet was a $20,000,000 error!\n\nIn the past this had always been a favorite place -- especially to take visiting friends and family, however, this evening I was very disappointed. Here's my story:\n\nArrived at 4:16pm and was surprised that there were zero others in line. This should have been a red flag, as the Feast Buffet was always packed. I was informed by the cashier that they were serving dinner at $9.99 per person. I paid for two and we were seated.\n\nMy primary complaints are as follows: \n1) Food quality is MUCH lower than on previous visits. It is obvious that most of the food is frozen-TV-dinner-entrees.\n2) Food not served at the proper temperature. Many items were luke-warm, including: green beans, mixed vegetables, meatballs, egg rolls, spare ribs roasted potatoes and sweet & sour chicken. Actually, just about everything I tried was not hot enough. Sliced roast beef was so tough it could not be chewed.\n3) Cost cutting measures that destroy the dining experience. A great example is in the Asian food area, where they offer only one entree (sweet & sour chicken) but there are 5 different starches. White rice, brown rice, fried rice and two types of noodles)\n4) This should have been #1... All of the food was old, stale and left over from lunch.\n5) The desert bar was a wreck! Ice cream was melted to slush and the cookies were as hard as rocks! There were some one-inch squares of cake that were stale and flavorless.\n\nAs a manager, I feel this buffet is a total failure. The original idea of a buffet was to over feed people so they play blackjack and slot machines until they are able to walk again. In my case most of the food was inedible. I must also question the savings when so much food is thrown away because it could not be eaten.\n\nAdvise to managers: Hot food hot; cold food cold! As for the $20 million error... It will take that much -- or more -- in advertising before I even consider returning to any Station Casino property.\n\nUPDATE: In addition to this review, I had posted a comment on their Facebook page. That comment was given the standard copy-paste reply to contact someone else, and I did -- however, the gave me the wrong email address. Posted another comment about not getting a reply and was given the super-secret-correct email address. A week ago I resent that email, and have yet to hear from them. With that said I will downgrade to a single star based on the fact that corporate customer service is every bit as good (read: \""horrible\"") as the buffet."
"My favorite club in Vegas. As far as I know, both guys and girls both have to pay for entry but for good reason. This club is totally awesome. \n\nThe main dance floor is pretty crowded but you can walk to the pool area to get some air. There are also 3 bars so the wait isn't too bad. If you don't want to wait in line for an hour+ then you better get there early unless you're in a big group of girls.\n\nOh yeah, the music is pretty good too :3"
"One of my favorite places to shop. Located in the Fourm Shops on The Strip, it has a very \""boutique\"" feel to it. The last time I was in here Lauren Conrad was shopping as well. You know a place is good if this fashionista is here. A lot of the tops are very blousy, which I love. \nYou can find an outfit for any occasion here. The staff is always very accommodating and helpful. It almost like they're personal shoppers, they really help you put together outfits. 5 stars!"
"This is my 2nd time at Udupi Cafe, and I waited to write a review until a 2nd visit to be sure. The service here is lackluster, our waiter actually told us that \""he only works here\"" and has no input into the chefs cooking when we asked him if we could not have all the vegetables in the mixed pakora platter. seriously? \n\nThe food is mediocre, the pakoras are dry and tasteless, we had chile pakoras and there was no spice or creativity to them.\n\nThe dosa itself is good, the potatoes are very mushy and have minimal taste and their chutneys are not the best quality. \n\nI would recommend spending more time on working on their food  preparation and less time on the wait staff telling us that nothing can be changed. As a 100% indian, i would recommend Jewel of the Crown over this cafe in an instant."
"Foods not amazing or close to Tadich Grill in SF that they claim they are created after. Been to taditch, while Triple George Grill looks the same the food is not the same. It wasnt good especially for the price. \n\nThe Fish and Chips were not fully cooked when they came. The chicken parm was fine but I can make better at home. I didnt need to eat this out. Calamari was very good, fresh, hot and crispy. Wedge salad was decent, good blue cheese, nice fresh tomatoes, would have been nicer if they took off the first leaf of wilted lettuce (not a big deal). Mushroom pasta was good, Id order that again. But do note on the pasta sauce that it is a bit sweet and has sun dried tomatoes, not sure if the menue states this or not. \n\nThe service was slow, friendly but slow. We went on a Sunday night it shouldnt have been an issue. \n\nI had to keep getting up to get fresh pepper from the pepper mill on the shelf above my table because the waiter didnt do it when salads or good came. That was kinda annoying for the type of restaurant.\n\nWith all the other great places to eat in Vegas, I wouldnt come back."
"I love books. I love bookstores. I do not own a kindle or a nook. So i tend to buy real books. The kind made from paper. It is rare though that i get a chance to stop by the bookstore. I wasn't missing anything except a future bodily injury just for standing in the wrong spot. \nI could see that this store was changing the layout of some sections. They were adding a toy section. So\nI guess i don't understand the older gentleman wheeling around a dolly and nearly running over my two year old, twice. No pardon me. No excuse me. Sir i know you are older, so i am sure that manners were around when you were a child. I like browsing \ni do\nNot like almost being ran over!!!!!! There is not an angry mob of early Christmas shoppers just waiting for you and your magic, kid smashing dolly to get all of the holiday crap set up in OCTOBER. Rude. I felt like i was in his way.\n Guess some people don't care about the real human shoppers. I did spend over $100 picking up a few books. The girl that rang us up was less than friendly. Asked if i had a membership card. I said no. That was that. No offer to get a membership. Just a buy my crap and leave attitude.  I believe this is the only bookstore in Henderson now. Love the selection. Guess i will stick to Amazon from now on though. At least I am not in anyone's way while I shop online. The people working there should be a bit more nice to\nShoppers. I could care less about your Christmas set up. Hope you guys got done with whatever it was in time though. Seemed like an emergency. One important enough that you shit on the customers. Me. I spend a TON on books. But seriously am just soooooooo\nOver rude ass store employees. Dont they teach you to be nice or maybe to drive the dolly down another path in customer service 101. Guess going around me would have taken up\nToo\nMuch chritmas display set up time. Those star wars bobbleheads are not going to  set themselves up. Gotta please the angry mob."
Look fo coupons! Great bread. Good food.
"Meal for the day.\n\nCame around 4pm and there was no line. Make sure to bring your M-life card...I forgot mine, you could get the points. \n\nThe first thing I head for was the prime rib. I loved it. Juicy, moist, tender, flavorful...it can't get any better than that. Our waiter was really awesome she was quick on clearing plates and letting us know that each person gets half a lobster. Great lobster. It was really small though but half a lobster is good for one person. The crab legs were my next pit stop. There were two kinds: snow crab legs and king crab legs. I personally liked the king crab legs because they were bigger and they were sliced in half, so we didn't have to use any tools but our fingers to take the meat out. The legs were juicy and it had a good amount of flavor. If it's too much spray some lemon it. Another great part of the buffet is dessert! So delicious. I wanted to get everything. I had the bananas foster, bread pudding, flan, and some cheesecake. Bread pudding was good but not what I expected. I truly loved the egg part of the flan but not the sauce paired with it. Why couldn't it just be a normal caramel sauce? But instead it had an orange-y flavor. They also have gelato I can't even remember what flavor I got. \n\n\nGeez what a fata$$. Whatever every bite of food from here was well worth it. I would come back for sure.\n\n\n-Give it a try. \n\n\np.s.: PACE YOURSELF!"
"Craving a little Italian and this place is always good.  Tonight I had the Seafood Cannelloni with lobster, shrimp and scallops, blended with roasted garlic and chives, topped with a light tomato cream sauce and crabmeat.  This was great choice.  \n\nFor desert, we split the Sogno Di Cioccolata \""Chocolate Dream\"" which is a very  rich fudge brownie brushed with Kahlua, add in a little chocolate mousse, fresh whipped cream  and it's a beautiful end to a good meal.\n\nI have been here several times and haven't every been disappointed, the prices are little higher, but the service is excellent.  So it's nice to spend a little, enjoy the meal, and leave feeling very satisfied."
"Outback Steakhouse\nMultiple Locations\n\nWith all the hype and advertising it was only natural to try Outback. It was a Tuesday night, and we were seated immediately. We chose not to have anything from the bar, and instead stayed non-alcoholic for the evening.\n\nCompanion #1 ordered a bowl of potato soup. It arrived hot, with nice chunky potatoes sticking out of the soup along with large pieces of bacon. No complaints were heard. Companion #2 ordered the Cesar Salad. It seemed run of the mill, and companion noted that it was a bit heavy handed on the cheese.\nI ordered the regular salad with the honey mustard vinaigrette. This was a nicely done salad.\n\nFor main courses, companion #1 ordered a medium bacon cheeseburger. The burger arrived medium but on the dry side, with barely adequate cheese and decent fries. Companion felt she had had better burgers in most fast food places.\nCompanion #2 ordered the rib eye steak medium rare. It arrived medium rare, but seemed to be poorly prepped in that it had lots of sinew on it, and the tail still had some silverskin attached. Seasoning was adequate but nothing special.\nI had the Ahi tuna appetizer along with the small sirlion. The Ahi was cooked correctly, but had been pre-cooked hours before, and was greatly over-seasoned. By the time you added the wasabi vinaigrette dipping sauce, the fish had no taste left of its own. In paying for a premium fish like Ahi, the fish should be the central character, and the rest of the condiments are the supporting role. The petite sirloin was cooked as ordered (rare), but lacked flavor and again, still had silverskin attached, making the last piece memorable for its chewiness.\n\nWe did not order any deserts.\n\nInspection of the restrooms was pleasant enough, in that they were recently cleaned, smelled fresh, and looked nice.\n\nOverall, I might rate Outback 2.5 to 3 stars. I've definitely had better at lower prices. BTW if you are tempted by the Blossom, their signature onion and your on a diet, companion #1 says stay far away from it. That one dish alone will use up the entire days amount of points!"
"The service was great, but for the price, the food was a little disappointing. It wasn't bad, but I've had better for the same price and even cheaper. We spent $222 + $40 tip. \n\nThe lobster mac and cheese could use a little more lobster. My wife's steak was a little under cooked. She ordered medium well, but it looked medium rare. \n\nThe bread was delicious. The chopped salad was good. The filet mignon was ok.\n\nOverall, if you want to spend this much money on a meal, go to T-Bones Chophouse or The Charcoal Room. Definitely better options."
The food is reasonablly priced and always comes out hot. We've never had a bad meal.
"Taiwan Cafe is the best place you can eat in Oakland.  Maybe even all of Pittsburgh. Everything I have ever ordered from here was good.  Their sushi is delicious, fresh, AND inexpensive.  \n\nAlthough it looks/smells dicey on the way down/outside, you're in for a treat.  Choy is the friendliest worker you have ever met.   He will always remember you and your order.  It's a great touch.  \n\nTcafe is a Pittsburgh staple. Go, eat, and enjoy. And then buy a six pack."
"This is a great clothing store. Trendy, and affordable. This is the kind of place you stop by on a friday afterwork to get your outfits for whatever you got going on that weekend. Lots of cute accessories too. I've never come here & left empty handed."
"How do they manage to keep all those beers in stock all the time? I've eaten there over 100 times and only had two \""not so good experiences.\"" I like those odds.  Most of the time the staff is helpful and friendly. They seem to enjoy or at least \""more than tolerate\"" being at work. The food is fantastic, the happy hour deal is a real bargain and they always have sports on the big screens. One more awesome aspect: the music kicks a$$. Southern Fried Chicken dinner is fantastic. The Korean short ribs are one of the best appetizers. I get \""no onions\"" on my chicken nacho's and they are so thoughtful that they put the Guacamole on the side because it has onions in it, Attention to detail, that most places lack. A+. My two bad trips. 1: they matinee waitress was rude, probably just having a bad day, but don't take it out on me. 2: My Korean short ribs were real fatty and under cooked, I never NEVER send food back so I was S.O.L.  Overall I love this place."
"Finally! A dollar store that fits the bill! This shop is nice and clean. Tidy. No mess. Great product assortment and variety of goods too. Had everything in stock that I was looking for. I really like the wide aisles to maneuver your shopping cart. Clerks were available and ready to help too. Oh, and my wait in line was just a few seconds. High five to this Dollar Tree store.. Keep it up!!"
Bluecorn enchiladas were fantastic.\nYou pay for chips and salsa that are supposed to be made when ordered but mine weren't. Pricey but good.
I would have given 3 stars except the fact that their Internet service was so slow I couldn't even open my email account while staying here for work. When I called to check on it they said there was nothing they could do. What? It's 2013. Not 1983. I would never stay here again. We thankfully got our rates on Priceline but I would never pay over 70 dollars a night for this place. And if you need Internet so you can do you work don't stay here at all.
"Wow, Very good, well priced.  You can't go wrong, there's delicious middle eastern food and desert.  I love the pastries.  Try a Turkish coffee."
"We have eaten here a handful of times, and today we returned to have the dinner buffet.This buffet offers many different selections and is always a decent meal.   We arrived early and there was no line.   We were first in line and there was many open seats yet it took them 8 minutes to show us a table.   Once seated we went through the line to be pleasantly surprised at the many different dishes they offered this time around.   We had some of the sushi, shrimp tempura, cucumber salad, fried rice, and some of the prime rib,  The sushi was not great,  I could tell it had been wrapped earlier in the day as the nori had really become hard.   The shrimp tempura was really good, yet they did not have any tempura dipping sauce.  The cucumber salad was fresh, but not marinated long enough.   The deserts were awesome, and our server was excellent.  One thing about buffets, if you space the time out visit to visit, you appreciate the offerings.   A very good buffet.  4 stars (5 stars when they start offering crab)"
"What a gem located in the middle of crazy. We love Las Vegas and all the excitement that comes with it but it's nice to step into serenity. Rooms are beautiful, customer service was perfection at every turn. The pool service, drinks, food and atmosphere can not be beat. We'll be back every time we're in town!"
"Resort is beautiful, and the pools are fun. They should allow guaranteed adjoining rooms for families. When you're paying their rates for two rooms, it is a real inconvenience to have to split up. They supposedly fixed our room assignments twice, but each time it became a bigger disaster. I've stayed here many times in the past, but management and competence have seriously declined in the last two years. I hope they get their act back together and turn the place around, because the resort and amenities are nice!"
Yucky greasy food.
This place got pretty good reviews so I decided to try it when I was in Vegas recently. The menu was pretty cool separating vegetarian from vegan and they even included some pictures. I ordered the vegan pork chops with veggies. It looked nothing like the  picture at all.  I got a plate full up half frozen pea's and carrots in a watery sauce with some fake meat on top. It was not pleasant.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the people are very nice and the fried tofu appetizer was just okay.
"Ok so my husband's from Pittsburgh and this place is legend. That said, our experience was mediocre. We walked in at 3pm, hoping to beat the lunch and dinner rush. We were seated by the bar, which was cool but weren't offered the option of a table and there were a few empty ones nearby and couldn't get a staff member to look at us until it was time to order. I ordered a steak and cheese and received a Pitts-burger. I asked the waitress if it was the steak and cheese and she nodded her head and walked off. That was the last interaction we had with any of the staff until we paid at the register. When she rang us up she listed off my sandwich, now calling it a Pitts-burger. Cool, thanks for ignoring us and dismissing my opportunity for you to correct your mistake. Checked the box for the original location, we will go to the spin-offs from now on."
Ordered for delivery here because I was at the TownePlace Suites nearby.  Lots of food and the sushi was awesome.  Delivered in less than 30 min on a sat night.
"Great atmosphere in this place. Had a huge booth overlooking the bar. Had the prime rib, and was happy with it. Good place, a little pricey, but you already knew that."
I came for Sunday brunch.  Nothing stood out.  Food was for the most part over-cooked and not memorable.  Dessert section is ok.  Definitely not worth the price and there are so many better  buffets in Vegas.  Will not be coming back.
Worth the money. You'll probably see celebrities here. You have to get there early to ensure entry.
"Tait, owner of Hon-Man,  has worked on my 92 Prelude since 2003 and continuous to offer his expert advice and diagnosis 8 years later even though I no longer live in AZ. \n\nToday is the perfect example.\n\nI've been having trouble getting the Prelude started and was quoted a $435 replacement for the Ignition Coil at a local shop here in Huntington Beach, CA. Though I trust the recommendations for this local shop, I still felt I needed to get Tait's input. It wasn't 5 minutes into the call that Tait said \""It's your Main Relay and it should only cost you $120, on top of that even if it was your Ignition Coil that should only cost $250, but it is the Main Relay I'm sure of it.\"" \n\nI called the local shop immediately to ask them to hold off on the repair. When the mechanic got on the phone the first thing he did was apologize and say they misdiagnosed the problem, it is actually the Main Relay, not the Ignition Coil. They wanted to charge $100 more than what Tait, quoted me so I mentioned I was getting lower quotes and they matched the price.\n\nBesides the excellence service and integrity that Hon-Man Auto Care stands by, more than anything I think the most impressive piece to this story is that this LOCAL shop had my car in their hands, I was there when they witnessed the start-up fail, yet they still misdiagnosed it. Tait, in ARIZONA, accurately diagnosed the problem in less than 5 minutes over a phone call where I just explained what I was experiencing. \n\nThere are no doubts when it comes to Tait and Hon-Man Auto Care. The only thing I must warn you of, is if you ever move out of Arizona, you will surely miss Tait and his excellent care."
"Arriba's was not as good as they used to be, apparently the original owner passed away and its under new ownership. Won't be coming back here again."
"Very disappointed in this restaurant.\n\nWhen we moved to Charlotte, The Penguin came highly recommended by locals so we wanted to check it out. We stopped in around 2pm on a Saturday hoping to have a good time. The waitress (I hesitate to give her this title because her apathetic attitude hardly lived up to anything resembling that of a waitress) was slow, inattentive and rude. I ordered the chicken tenders and 25 minutes later she stopped by the table and stated \""what else do you want besides the chicken tenders\"" rather than apologizing that they were out of chicken tenders and offering to show me a menu so I could choose another option. I reluctantly  chose the mac and cheese and over the next 25 minutes was actually looking forward to them, but maybe that was just the intense hunger I was feeling after the long wait. When the food arrived, a basket of chicken tenders were placed in front of me as the waitress mumbled \""oh, guess there were chicken tenders\""  The entire order was incorrect and and the food was almost inedible. I don't complain about waiting a little longer  food if the food and service is worth it. Unfortunately, the food fell short of mediocre. Our food showed up cold and was not good."
"I just stayed two nights at Aria. It is a great hotel...my company paid for it, which is great because I would never spend that kind of money...and the rooms aren't even the worse of it!! ONE drink at the pool will set you back a hefty sum...which I can't repeat here...just know, it's probably the most expensive on the strip.\nWe didn't get the chocolates or a turn down service that some other reviewers have mentioned, that's ok..most everything was wonderful.  I was dismayed a bit  at the bath products...a lower end brand, and of definitely lower end quality. \nThe restaurants were all really good that we ate at...the Thai place was as good, if not better, than any I've been to in the US.  The casino was nice, not too smokey, and the servers were pretty quick. \nThe pool was nice, a few good choices...one that was more adult orientated, so not a bunch of kids having a great time...not something I look for in a relaxing pool day. As usual...I always wish there was more shade and/or umbrellas..but all in all..a great pool experience. \nAll in all, a great place, although pricey..that's expected."
"PATHETIC. This place has gone from bad to worse in a matter of months. Wish I could give you Zero stars.\n\n I decided to give 777 another chance since my review back in March. I wish that I didn't. \n\nAs I said in my prior review, the best thing here are the microbrews. Correction, the best thing about 777 WAS the microbrews. I ordered a High Roller and immediately noticed that it did not look the same. It used to be a golden color, now its more of a red/brown. \nI asked the bartender whats up with the beer and he said that they got a new brewmaster. The High Roller tasted nothing like before. The bartender said that many people have been complaining and offered to give me a different kind. I went with the Black Chip. It tasted like right (must have been an old batch before the new guy came).  \nI ordered a burger and ate it at the bar and also ordered some korean tacos to-go. A few minutes went by and I noticed that the bartender quickly swap out my bill with a new one. I looked at it and he was charging me $2 because I was taking some food to-go. WTF? The bartender said he can't do anything about it and said he can get the manager. Yes, do that I requested.\nThe manager came out and I told him that I have been coming to 777 for 15 years and and this place has fell to $hit. I told him the food prices went up considerably and the quality has never got better. I also mentioned that the beer is not the same. He said its a different color but should taste the same. What?? This guy is clueless. Get a clue and rename your beers something else, and not try to pass off $hit as diamonds to your customers. \nI finally mentioned to him about nickel and dimeing me for $2 because I wanted to take an order home. He took the $2 off but still.\n\nI am NEVER EVER COMING BACK."
"Who would have thought that Champaign, Illinois can put out the best barbecue? You lucky UIUC kids, I'm jealous!\n\nLast September, I went to Black Dog for the first time on a double date. We had a 40-minute wait but time flew by in their awesome draft beer selection. They ran out of the famous burnt ends (meat cut from the point half of a smoked brisket) by the time we sat down, but everything else was delicious so I promised myself to go back. And I did, 3 times! It has become a tradition for my boyfriend and me. The quality of their food and beer is amazingly consistent.\n\nThe burnt ends turned out to be perfectly charred, moist and smokey. On top of that, their hot polish and chicken are just mind blowing. I never pick chicken over beef/pork at bbq places, until I reached my fork into my friend's Black Dog chicken platter :P But tonight, we got another surprise...Smoke Duck Special, which has now made Thursday night the best night! Both the duck and the chicken are worth trying. They not too greasy and deliciously spiced.\n\nLast but not least, I have fallen in love with their sides and bbq sauces. You can't go wrong with the sweet potato fries and the vinegar based slaw, also, the cornbread has BRISKET in it! I know the bbq sauce variety does not help your decision making. If you like something with a little \""zing\"" or \""kick\"", I suggest the Hot Georgia Peach and the mustard."
"We only had time for one dinner in Charlotte and decided on Dandelion Market, as it was close to our hotel and, unfortunately for us, it was pouring the night we went!  We ordered a variety of tapas:  spinach & goat cheese salad (good, but one small sliver of goat cheese?), calamari (it was just OK), ribs (very good), brussel sprouts (really good), shrimp and grits (very good) and the beef sliders (excellent).  I would put the sprouts and sliders at the top of the list.  Ordered a bottle of cabernet.  I realize I shouldn't complain, as all their bottles are only $25, but the wine was just OK...I think it was called The Show & we found it to be a bit on the sweet side.  For dessert we split a brownie w/caramel & ice cream, which was decent, but I wouldn't run back for it.  Would def. try a different dessert in the future.  Overall, a really nice experience in a pretty cool atmosphere."
"Coming here was a last minute decision due to Firefly's long wait. I was told that this place was great and it was just like Yardhouse, BJ's, and Chicago Brewing Co. This made me excited because I love all of those places.\n\nOnce we were seated, I realized that all the tables were so close together even though the restaurant wasn't even packed. Generally, I like the brewhouse feel. I was so excited to try the housemade root beer here. It's funny because I usually hate root beer but after trying Chicago Brewing Co.'s housemade stuff, I am so intrigued to try housemade root beer. To my disappointment, all of their drinks tasted like heavy syrup in each one. We got Strawberry Lemonade, Peach Iced Tea, and Homeade Root Beer. All of them were vigorously stirred and still tasted way too sweet. We ordered Tapas for appetizers. You can never really go wrong with Olive Tapenade and that's what I stuck with. It was good. For food, there was steak tacos, some flatbread stuff?, and veggie pizza. According to my friend, steak tacos were meh. Flatbread had no flavor. Veggie pizza was decent. Service was also somewhat lacking and irritatingly slow for how NOT busy it was. \n\nToo bad that this place wasn't that great. I really wanted to like it. Apparently, this place used to be banging every night before Yardhouse came around."
Love this place!  Everything I have tried is excellent!  I love ordering online and doing takeout.  Great healthy yummy food!
"Being a (closet) fan of Jaimee Rose's  Azcentral blog, I had heard about Noca a few weeks ago. I always enjoy trying out new restaurants and admit to still being very unfamiliar with many of the well known establishments here in the Valley.Trusting her taste and the pictures and descriptions of the items, I was keen on going and what better a time than my birthday. We were a party of 5 and had the following:\nParents: Kampachi and a suggestion from the waiter not on the menu but very tasty (linguini with shrimp).\nGirlfriend: Pappardelle\nSister: Duck\nMyself: Spinach mezzaluna\n\nI have to commend our waiter. Very friendly but not overbearing. She was very familiar with the menu and was able to recommend some wines, which is usually something I don't do but felt comfortable doing with her. She was able to answer all our questions regarding some of the dishes we were unfamiliar with as well.\n\nPositives: \nVery class cozy ambiance. Restaurant was smaller and not exactly what I thought it would be with the \""bigger is better\"" mentality I'm used to in the US but that takes nothing away from it on the contrary.\n\nService is excellent for the most part. Never had to ask for water and the bussers and waiters always seem to have the right timing to refill your water or assist you. \n\nThe quality of the food was exceptional, though the 1 star penalty goes towards the portions or \""bang for your buck\"". I'd have wished for a few more mezzaluna's and other than my girlfriend's reasonable portion they did seem to be a bit too \""european\"" even for my taste.\n\nThe desserts really were the cherry on the cake. Perfect portions, very creative and tasty. You actually receive cotton candy at the end of your meal (regardless of a dessert or not I'm can't be sure). I really enjoyed the milk and cookies (excellent chocolate chip cookies provided with a cup of delicious vanilla milkshake). We also enjoyed the cheesecake dessert which consisted of rolled balls of cheesecake with a strawberry coulis and the small doughnuts with jelly were delicious as well. The best part was not footing the bill!\n\nNegatives (few but could use some improving):\n\nThe delay between our order and receiving our food was probably 10-15 minutes. I'm used to having some bread in restaurants that I would consider \""classy\"" or expensive and that was lacking here. They did provide an \""amuse bouche\"" that was original but for some could be considered a bit odd. It consisted of a spoon of mint,melon and pop rocks, quite the party in your mouth and refreshing but not very filling for the wait.\n\nI definitely look forward to returning and trying out some of their other dishes. The desserts were exceptional and I'm quite certain a few clients came in just for those, similar to what I do with out of town visitors at Oregano's. All in all a pleasant and welcome surprise to the dining scene here in the valley."
"Locale is clean, staff is friendly. Had the classic chicken, smash fries and lemon herb tea. Food is good, price is reasonable. Had a good lunch."
Really nice course with unbelievable homes all throughout the course! Driving range looked pretty fried but all in all was a good experience. Pro shop guys were very friendly and helpful and made my first experience a great one. Will definitely be going back. If you call to book a tee time I highly suggest you ask for James (nicest guy ever). Great price for locals! I got on for $59 at 12:30 in late November as a local. Great deal!
Thank you for saving our Christmas meal ingredient scavenger hunt!! Stay open on Christmas and save more dinners!
"First time ever eating here, got a Gyro Salad for lunch. It's huge, only 6.95 and a great fast meal. \n\nOther stuff looks iffy, so eat at your own risk!"
"This place is no good now - HUGE portions of rice in the nigiri, and 3 of our group came down with food poisoning after eating here.\n\nThe yakisoba and other appetizers weren't that good either, even if you ignore the issues with the nigiri and our getting sick.\n\nWould not recommend, ever."
"I recently purchased trail mix from the bins in the front of the store. I Brought it home and put it in a sealed container. A week later tiny cockroaches filled the container. Frozen foods seem as if they've been thawed and then refrozen. The guy behind the deli counter is rude and always behaves as if he is annoyed by his customers. My family was hanging in there hoping most of this was a fluke,  but the cockroaches put us over the edge. When we called to inform the manager she did not apologize and just offered a refund. How about a notice to all of you customers that you've sold them cockroach eggs?"
"Good, fresh, tasty, abundant, good value.  Say, \""Hi\"", to Micky."
"My child was enrolled in the pre-k program, at this location, for about a month. During this time she had trouble with another little boy in the class making violent and sexual remarks toward her, including threats to have her head smashed in with a hammer and her private area licked. \n\nThe Center director talked to my child and the little boy, and came to the conclusion that nothing happened. In her follow up conversation with me she implied that my child needed counseling, while dismissing my concerns and allowing this little boy with known disciplinary issues to remain in the classroom. My child was pulled out of the classroom and placed with 3 year olds! \n\nNot comfortable that my child would be protected in the environment, I decided to pull her out and enroll in another local daycare center. We have had no further issues since transferring and ALL inappropriate words and actions have stopped! She is no longer afraid to go to school in the morning. It saddens me that one child who clearly has issues would be allowed to taint an entire room of children. After 3+ years with kindercare in another state I am incredibly disappointed with the way this situation was handled and am no longer a customer."
"I was at this Applebee's with my fiance and 2 daughter's.  We waited patiently for a waitress or even someone to acknowledge that we were there. No one came... As we were leaving the hostess at the door was told and her only comment was \""Oh I'm sorry.\"" But did nothing else. So we came to Chili's were we were seated immediately and our waitress Toni took our order and brought our drinks. I work at a casino and also handicap,  customer service to me is so important. Chili's is by far the better restaurant and just down the street from this messed up restaurant.  I would've gave them NO STARS at all. The sad thing is the manager was right across from us when I complained and she did nothing!"
Very clean and comfy too. Woke up refreshed and smiling. Would stay here again in a heart beat. The freebies are AWESOME. Great food and drinks.
"Negative star! This place is the last place you want to go. I went there to get my lab results, they had me wait for 2 hrs just to tell me my labs aren't ready and i had to come back!"
"This is the first time I have ordered from them and I must admit I want too happy.  They delivered in a timely manner, but the pizza wasn't very good.  Hardly any cheese and my pizza was burnt :(. I also ordered wings and the sauce wasn't too flavorful.  I will stick to my Rosatis.  Sorry Barros you were not very good, at all."
"I walk past here everyday on my way to work, and although I haven't eaten there yet, I've been watching them build it for the past few months, and I'm excited to have a new taco joint besides fillib' in the neighborhood. All the people working there are always smiling, and I stopped in for a menu to good conversation.  Can't wait to finally eat there!"
"A carnosaurus rex's home from home. Could I be any clearer? From the post-modern retro American decor, with a slightly agricultural flavor, in this family-owned and family-friendly, gastronomic paradise to the scrummy nomnomnomalicious treats, Joe's Real BBQ has it all. This is undoubtedly one of my all-time favorite restaurants in the Valley. \n\nI invariably survey the whole menu every time I go and I end up going with the ribs, which are always juicy (read a couple of reviews in which the reviewer said that the ribs were dry; I dunno, I think you went on the one day of the year they are dry) and coated with a BBQ sauce that is to die for. I've never gone wrong with the potato salad, coleslaw, or corn, but I hear the BBQ pit beans are great too. I'm not a root beer fan, but my son swears it's awesome and he's usually pretty forthcoming about things that don't sit well with him, so I've got to believe the root beer doesn't suck too badly. The pulled pork and the chicken rawk the sawks, so check them out if you get a chance. \n\nAlso love the take-out window outside. If you don't feel like standing in line inside (and there's always a line around lunchtime and dinner), then get your quick fix with some take-out instead. \n\nAll of the menus can be found at Joe's Web site: http://www.joesrealbbq.com/menu.php\n\nThe prices are on a par with Famous Dave's, but I think the food is much better, so Joe's offers better value and a real down-to-Earth, all-American family atmosphere."
"I wish I continued reading more reviews instead of just the first 3 and looking at the pictures.\n\nFirst I'll say is the wait was wayy too long.  We came into this place for a breakfast before we went to our volunteering event, and the wait for our food really made us pushing it to get there on time, not to mention the fact that we had to send our food back because it wasn't thoroughly cooked,\n\nNow onto the meal... Certainly not work the money!  The eggs were raw (and sent back as previously stated), the sausage was disgusting, the mushrooms dried out quickly.  They got my friend's order wrong, but since they didn't enter it correctly on the receipt, they didn't offer to correct her order either.  When I sent back my eggs, the waitress said \""just so you know, this is a french-inspired restaurant and this is how they eat their eggs\"".  Good for the French, but we're in America, and I want my eggs cooked all the way through... and not even an apology.   \n\nAs far as the service goes, they were just slow.  The staff came across as unapologetic and stressed, which I don't know why because while I was sitting there, I only saw them bring out food for the couple that ordered before us.  The other 4 sets of people that were there before us either didn't order food (I'm assuming because no food ever came for them) or already had their food.  \n\nOverall, it was just a bad experience.  If I can say anything positive, the macarons were good.  My friend enjoyed her croissant, and the timing for our replacement eggs were much quicker.  \n\nIF and its a big IF I ever go here again, it will be strictly for the pastries."
"We are in Vegas on vacation and we always enjoy finding the local places to eat that you just can't find anywhere else. Yayo Taco was excellent!!! I'm pretty sure we ordered one of everything from the menu; the Pollo, the Camarones, the Texano and the Shanghi tacos were incredible!!! You gotta go..."
"I had the buta-burger as it was all the flavors that i love...the burger was surprising good! i didnt expect it to be as bomb as it was....i was like 2nd in line and they were crazy fast too, which is always appreciated...my only gripe is that its kinda expensive..other than that, awesome!"
"Went here for my honeymoon. The air conditioner was making a loud noise when we got to our room at 2:30pm. I called the front desk and asked if we could switch rooms and was told that they would have maintenance come look at the unit. The guy shows up to our room at 10:35pm. He looks at the unit and says that they needed to replace a motor. Said he would come back the next day at 11:00 (Saturday). He never showed up for the rest of our stay. When I checked out (three days later) the clerk at the front desk showed no remorse or apology. Not much good to say about the Luxor. I am sure they were good in their heyday but they really need to get their PR together. The carpet looks old, the elevator felt like it was going to come loose and fall down the shaft. I am DONE with the Luxor and say never again! Thumbs DOWN Luxor #0 on a scale from #1 to #10."
"Stay away!!!! This AAA approved shop made me cancel my membership after the experience that I received from these guys.\nThe worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. Will not honor their warranty and will tow your vehicle if you try to dispute their work. Their service clerks are RUDE, unprofessional, and misinformed nit wits."
"A huge improvement, a complete turn-around. As though Mr. Happy himself has been imbued into the staff here. \n\nUpon arrival, it was empty but then started filling up. The wait staff and hostess at the counter were pleasant and very helpful. \n\nUpon ordering we received our little flag and found our table to sit. The brownie was brought out first. Very quick this time around. Not more then 5 mins. And within a minute more, another person brought out our drink. She was gracious and very polite, making the experience so much more delightful. \n\nWithin a few more minutes, a younger waitstaff came around to let us know our food will be next. Also very polite, and not sassy. \n\nOnce again, a complete turnaround from our previous experience. All the i's dotted all the t's crossed. And not just for us, we witnessed the same pleasant demeanor for every guest that came to eat. Always someone stopping by to ask how the meal is, everything to our satisfaction. Perfect - Delicious - Very Hospitable and Friendly\n\n4 stars is only because the restroom needed a little pickme up. \n\nfin"
"We had dinner plans with friends on the calendar for over a month... When we made the plans, we said we'd figure out the time and place as the date approached.  So when my friend suggested we go to FnB, I hesitated for a moment...\n\n\""What is FnB,\"" I asked? (Embarrassed that I had no clue).\n\n\""It's the new restaurant located where Sea Saw and Digestif used to be,\"" my friend informed me.\n\n\""OK - Perfect,\"" I responded - still having no clue what to expect.\n\nJared and I were fans of Digestif and ironically, we happened to be there on the last night they were open.  We went in for dinner on Sunday, October 18th (the day after our wedding) and were shocked to hear the news... But enough about that!\n\nIn just six weeks time, this restaurant transformed into FnB, the creation of Pavle Milic and Chef Charleen Badman.  It now has a bit more space and a warmer, lighter feeling to it... the tile on the floor is really unique and colorful.  You can tell it's a family-run business too... we felt extremely welcome from the moment we set foot inside and we met the entire staff, Emily, Josh, Pavle, Chef Charleen, and Sous Chef Sasha.\n\nBut enough about the atmosphere and the fantastic staff, I'm sure you want to know about the food!\n\nThe menu is limited, but pretty much everything on it is appealing.  Luckily, our table was up for sharing.  We started with two orders of the crispy rock shrimp & jalapeno tartar and a fried green tomato salad.  Both were delicious... I especially enjoyed the combination of the fried green tomatoes with green goddess dressing and feta.  \n\nWe continued with the citrus marinated olives as an appetizer to share... they aren't kidding with the \""citrus\"" description - you can really taste it and I loved it!\n\nJared and I shared the boneless trout entree and our companions shared the roast jidori chicken entree and we all shared an order of the spigarello.  What's spigarello? It's similar to broccoli rabe but not quite as bitter.  Chef Charleen prepares it with garlic and chili and it's delicious!  Needless to say, we cleaned all of our plates!\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, we proceeded to order one of each of the dessert offerings: a lemon creme brulee, an apple crisp, and the cherry chocolate bread pudding that Angela mentioned in her review.  The lemon brulee and the bread pudding were the favorites at our table.  And from listening to Pavle talk about it, I think the chocolate bread pudding is his favorite too!\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention that I was the only drinker in our group last night... I had a glass of sauvignon blanc - one from Chile - and it was perfect.\n\nThe prices aren't bad considering everything used at this restaurant is bought fresh daily from local farms.  We'll be back to see our friends at FnB again soon... and I encourage you to go check out this little gem of a restaurant as well!  Just make sure to save us a seat at the bar."
"Service was uninsprired.  So many options at so many interesting and exciting places in Vegas . . . does not seem possible.\n\nWe were with a group of guys with big plans for the evening.  We had to stand-up, find servers to get them to come to the table to bring us more drinks.\n\nFood was very good.\n\nLike the viewing grill.\n\nRoom is tired."
"I wanted to try a NEW AYCE Sushi place and this came up since I was nearby after getting my oil changed at Midas and it was date night with Hunnie Bunnie. \nHB had her Udon Noodles and Edamame (these come UNsalted).. \nI ordered Ahi Poke (This had cucumber salad, seaweed salad and small pieces of Ahi tuna. I mean, it was SMALL. Not like any of the other Ahi Poke i've had before at other restaurants. In fact, Amando S. can make Ahi Poke better than this place!), Fried Calamari (this was SO good, I LOVED it, I put in a second order for it! NOM!!), Baked Scallop Shell (Not bad at all, oily of course as they usually are, but apparently not as oily as the Dynamite, but it was tasty.), Baked Green Mussels (Small mussels but they were good), Fried Gyoza (I was not a fan of the flavor of these and neither was HB, I tried to pawn them off to her but she wasn't interested), Fried Shumai (I wasn't a fan of these either but HB LOVED them. She gobbled them up), a Spider Roll (This was so hard to get down, but probably because I was insanely full but it came with 8 pieces... I had asked the server for a half order but she said it only came in five pieces anyway, would I like them to make it small? Yes I would. So I guess \""small\"" meant small pieces, but MORE pieces. HUMPH. , Salmon & Avocado Handroll (this was good, my favorite type of handroll!), Sweet Shrimp (it came out with just the sweet shrimp nigiri... I was like Ummm do you fry the heads too?? She said YES and brought some out to me a little later, but I guess you have to ask for this item along with the sweet shrimp!), Tuna, Salmon and Hamachi nigiri (these were FINE. Nothing special. Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)\nI've experienced better sushi at other places, so I don't plan to go back here, but the service was good and the Calamari was delicious! I just wasn't too impressed with the fish!"
"Hands down, Go see Minas if your serious about suits and formal wear. Brothers Tailors has tailored three semi-custom suits for me and I've bought about seven custom shirts from them.  They tailor and fit my jeans and slacks and even fixed a Versace necktie that had come unstitched after I snagged it.\n\nI do local and international business and everywhere I go someone complements my suit or shirt. Friendly and willing to help the staff here is great and they will work within your budget if you're on one.\n\nHighly recommend!"
"I really don't like AMC very much. I prefer Harkins and even Cinemark to AMC. So I went and saw a movie here yesterday with my mom and sister in law and it was fine, the movie was good. That really has nothing to do with the theatre, but it helps. I guess my main complaint with AMC is their concessions. They are really expensive and not very good. The popcorn is expensive and it's not good. They have the do it yourself butter which is terrible because then you can't get any butter in the middle of the popcorn and about 10 minutes into the movie the popcorn is all dry and sticks in your throat. Although, this may be a good thing because their butter tastes weird... like a little fishy. yuck. Anyway, I just think there are better theatres out there (like any other type of theatre....). I understand this may just be convenient or you may have a gift card to AMC (like we did), but it's just meh."
"$2.50 each way, pay at the bottom though and really no one managing who pays and who doesn't.  Lady at payment window says \""Exact payment.\"" Not $3 not $5, $2.50 exactly! If you don't have exact, then your screwed.  Then you go to give her your exact change and she yells at you to put it in an \""Exact Change\"" box outside the window.  *Sigh*\n\nWhen you get to the bottom there is absolutely NOTHING to do whatsoever.  So save yourself the walk and turn back around and get on the 30 minute line to ride back up...this is if you parked at the top. \n\nVery poorly managed.  Nice views but that's it, so as long as you don't mind spending money for ride and parking just for a 2 min ride to enjoy a view."
"I hate this place.  Why is ok to degrade Buddhist statues but never say a word about the virgin mary.  I am offended at the cultural appropriation and not to mention their billboards make me sick.  I love sex and I love love Vegas, but keep my religion out of it!\n\nThe food also is not that good, nor the cocktails.  If you are from CA, try the Geisha House in Hollywood.  It is amuch classier version."
"This is probably the best coffee shop in Summerlin. It's a bit pricey, but the drinks are solid, and the macaroons are to die for."
"I'm going to come out and say it, the buffet isn't all that. It's certainly not worth it. At least not these days. Maybe back when it was new and all that, but like fish sitting out, the moment it gets old it's not worth eating and should be tossed out. \n\nSo it's really confusing as to why there's so many people lining up to this thing daily. And while I'm a huge fan of seafood, especially when you have it in Vegas where they ship in thousands upon thousands of tons of fresh fish daily, you would expect to actually find something good here. \n\nWhat you end up with is just over hyped buffet food that isn't worth the lines you're waiting in, nor the coin you're dropping to get in. \n\nMaybe it's just that I'm over the buffet scene. The younger me would have been all over this. In fact, I was. Back in my early 20's I would come here a lot when I came to Vegas and stuff myself with all this seafood and feel incredibility sick for the rest of the day. \n\nBut in the many years since I've come to realize that while I'm paying for quantity, the quality sure has suffered. And really, for the amount you're paying to get in here, you're just losing yourself in the moment of trying to make the plates add up to the amount. \n\nYou're better off just going to a nice sit down restaurant that is highly rated and has a specialty you like and enjoy the meal without feeling like you're in the rush to make your dollar count. \n\nYou'll certainly bypass the awful lines to get in, as well as not deal with every tourist who was told they had to come to the Bellagio Buffet."
what a bunch of losers went in too sell some silver .999 and they did not want it and i also had a 2010 green bay packers team signed Superbowl football with all paperwork and they said they don't buy sports memorabilia   its call gold and silver?  and dint want silver wtf  i have seen on there fake show them buying these types of items   and the tool at the pawn counter  acted like it was such a bother to look at my items  what i joke   sold my silver and football at a real pawn shop for  $4500
"My boyfriend and I love coming here for their prime rib special. You get a huge slice of prime rib, green beans, your choice of mashed potatoes, baked potato, or rice, and cherries jubilee for dessert. It is worth the $8, trust me. \n\nTheir prime rib is very juicy and flavorful. The mashed potatoes are my favorite because of the gravy! it is pure deliciousness. My favorite part about the cherries jubilee is the little cookie that they serve with it. Put some of the ice cream on it, and you're in for a real treat!!\n\nIf you don't feel like eating prime rib, try some of the local food they have on the menu. Definitely worth it. \n\nTip: be prepared to wait for at least 15 minutes. There is usually a long line, so I wouldn't come here if you are looking to eat right away."
"A ghastly excuse for an airport, LAS is grossly undersized and can't cope with the amount of passengers that pass through it's doors daily. \n\nThe C/D security is nighmarish, several times I waited near 1 hour in these lines. A/B is much better, but it seems like you end up in C/D much more often due to the airlines that fly from there. \n\nGetting a cab from LAS is insane. Thankfully I lived in Henderson and usually drove when I used this airport so it wasn't an issue. \n\nThe noise of slots and the repeating advertisements in the baggage claim area are enough to drive you to want to off yourself."
"This is by far my worse hotel stay-horrible customer service, old and disgusting rooms and elevators that don't work. In fact we got stuck in one! The restaurants are slow and their system always seems to be broken so they could not give us our bill! But by far the worse is the location of the shuttle pick-up. Impossible to find because its in the back in a creepy alley where it feels like you will get shot or robbed. No one knows anything or can answer questions. Basically ruined my vegas experience."
"I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE Cafe Boa! I have been coming here for 5 years. They usually have excellent menu options, fabulous service and healthy alternatives. So I figured that it would be a great place to take my out of town friends for a nice dinner. However, my visit over the weekend was less than good. Not great, good! The server was really slow. It took at least 15 minutes to get our cocktails and it wasn't like they were super busy or anything. It was a Sunday night!  There wasn't much in the way for vegetarian options on their current menu. Most items contained beef or pork of some sort. They were out of the wedge salad. Two of us ordered the fettucini and it was WAY too oily. Neither of us wanted to finish the dish. I think a bit of a sauce would have greatly improved this dish. One of us ordered the penne, which would have been good, had it not been so incredibly spicy. Our mouths are still burning! And our other friend ordered the fried chicken. It was probably the best option any of us had ordered, although from across the table I could see that I was probably left in the fryer just a tad too long. Our appetizers were probably the best things we all ordered. Had we just left it at that, our experience may have been better. It's probably going to be a while til I return, hopefully then they will have the issues worked out."
"White pizza with extra garlic, pepperoni & mushroom Mmmmmmm. Not as scenic as the Brooklyn bridge location (you do get a cute fountain in front and there's outdoor patio seating), but it's soooo close to home! I don't have to fly to NYC to have Grimaldi's. And there's NO 1-hour wait outside (although I think the long wait and the crowded & tight dining area in NYC made the experience more authentic).\nMy advice: eat there, don't take it to-go. The pizza tastes so much better fresh from the oven. I didn't try it at this location but the house red wine in NYC was deelish!\ndon't forget XTRA GARLIC!"
"Great... the Chicken Parmesan tastes awesome. The atmosphere is perfect. I love \""The Beacon\"" which is their sort of quiet lounge area they have separate from the main restaurant. Staff is awesome and great management team. They care about their Customers! Keep up the great service Bonfyre!"
"I've tried Coffee Plantation twice. \n\nBoth times I ordered a vanilla latte, and both times the espresso was extremely bitter. The first time, it was just bitter coffee taste + milk (no vanilla or sugar flavor whatsoever). The second time, it was bitter coffee taste + vanilla syrup + way too much sugar.  No consistency in recipes apparently, but consistency in the espresso sucking.\n\nThe guy last night was reasonably nice. The girl I had the first time was very short, impatient and seemed very unhappy to be there. \nMenu is hard to read - sure, handwritten chalkboards are cute, but this one is a jumble and is hung way up and far back. \n\nThere is ample seating and it seems like a decent place to hang out. Unfortunately the coffee is so bad I wouldn't bother."
Love this place. Good happy hour specials. Food is consistently great!
"It's a bar with great burgers!  Love this place and eat there..... probably too often for lunch.\n\nIf you walk in at the lunch-rush do not be disturbed by the line..... it'll be long!  But it also moves quickly.  Service is fast and great.  Generally, by the time I put my order in, get a drink and sit down my burger is delivered within a minute or two.\n\nThe burgers are terrific and they have some of the the best onion rings around.  Fries are great too.\n\nIt can be a bit pricey though..... burger, side, and drink will run you about $10.  Is it worth it..... meh, borderline but I enjoy it enough."
"Just moved to the area , found this place, WOW !! They are awesome! Vencent is the best! He did everything that my nails lady back in Dallas used to do for me. The techniques and everything just did it for me. It is hard to find someone that would do a good job on your nails. Especially when I work in the customer service field, having great looking nails is always a plus. I have gotten so many complements from everyone around me. \nAngel Touch Nails also give a great customer service, meaning, they offer their customers the bottles of water while waitng. They say hello to you with a smile. They make you feel very welcome.\n\nI will definitely going back!"
"If I could give no stars I would. This is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. Their billing is so messed up. I am supposed to be price locked (meaning I signed a 2 year agreement with them for $120/month) in with them and every couple of months I get a bill that is $30 to $40 higher. I have to call them and argue with them about them. It's ridiculous.\nJust recently I moved and when I called to transfer the services I asked the CSR if there were going to be any fees associated with the transfer and she assured me there would not be. When the guy came to install it again I asked him \""this gonna cost me anything?\"" again the answer was no. Just got my bill and guess how much.... $266!! $146+ more than it's supposed to be. $120 INSTALLATION FEES. Oh and now my monthly charges went up from $120 to $157/month. Im livid. I hate this company with a passion and cannot wait for this damn contract to be up! And of course, no 24 hour customer service."
"I had been craving a milkshake from sonic for weeks, I finally went and got one today! The guy didn't put the lid on all the way, MILK SHAKE EVERYWHERE!!!! All the guy did was offer more napkins! Half of my milkshake spilled out. I even paid more to get extra pie crust in the shake...I et to work to get and my order is completely wrong! It's not brain surgery people!!!!"
"I came to this shop because Discount Tire broke a stud while changing my tire. Discount pays for this repair only through Network. This will be the only reason I ever come back to this shop.\nI have been here in the past for repairs. Customer service is terrible and front desk is very unorganized. The first two repairs I had at this shop were fine. I came back for a air conditioning problem. Network told me that I needed a new air compressor at $1500. I didn't have the money at the time and chose to hold off on the repair. I ended up going to another shop for a second opinion and estimate. The other shop found the compressor was perfectly fine it was a bad seal on the compressor. I paid under a $100 for part and labor, I also was taken into the bay, shown and explained the problem. Network is a joke and embarrassment to the honest automotive shops."
"The security is very rude and disrespectful,  so are most of the managers.  I don't recommend anyone of color to go there because they are racist and they discriminate!!! This wasn't the first time it's happened to myself and a few others in line.  They say no flats on ladies night yet all the Hispanic chicks were flat boots, yet when my sister had them on they turned us away! DISCRIMINATON! !!!!! Who ever own this place needs new security, management ASAP or they will loose a lot of business. As long as your popping bottles they don't care.  Smh, the Damn food isn't even that great! If you're looking for a good time this isn't the place."
"Barcelos combo table d'hote portions are very filling and customers leave satisfied. \n\nI ate the chicken leg and lamb chop combo and found them both to be packed with taste but a little on the dry side. My fellow diners reported the same impression.\n\nI'll definitely give them some more tries as I think this restaurant has got potential and is reasonably priced with a pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little bit cramped."
"sit down and eat AND try everything! - that's the best advice i can give you.\nsit down and eat because, if you take your food home (such as the birria), the juices will leak in the bag and you won't be able to sop all of it up with the tortillas they give you. try everything because you can and you will be a better person having done so. i tried the buche, not knowing it was cow esophagus. it was DELICIOUS and i have bought some since. my young daughters LOVE the ribs and the ceviche is the best. sometimes, i ask the tortilla makers to bag me up a bunch right off of the line, squeeze some lime on them and eat them right out of the bag. that \""chocolate\"" drink (i forgot the name) that is sold by all the other fresh drinks is soooooooooo good and HOT, so don't drink it straight away. chandler is really looking up these days - i can get true birria here, get a jamaican meat patty from down the street, cuban moros and christianos across THAT street, and a really, really great hot dog with chili and asiago from the hugest pittsburgh fan in an antique shop a walk away from there. YAY!"
"We were looking for a totally different resto to lunch at in Old Montreal when we accidentally walked by this charming little restaurant. We were warmly greeted and shown to a great little table looking out onto the cobblestone street and it's occasional passing horse-drawn carriage. It was all very touristy, but in the best sense possible.\nHaving heard that Polish food tended toward heaviness we carefully chose our lunch portion to match our appetite.  I had the tripe soup (Flaki)  and an entree level order of pierogies whereas the Missus had Barszcz and Kielbasa - their typical beet soup and sausage meal.\nThe honeycomb tripe's texture was OMG wonderful, as was the hearty broth. The pierogies were completely unexpected. They were delicate little pouches, their translucent skins glistening and  hinting at the promise of meaty yummy goodness. A dollop of sour cream just sent the meal over the top. I almost started planning a trip to Poland solely on the strength of these nibbles it was that good.\n\nI think that the Missus's meal met her standards because she wouldn't share any of her dishes with me. For shame, Missus, for shame! ;-)"
"Art's was recommended by a family friend; however, after my experience there I am really wondering how often they actually used Art's. The guys working the front desk are super nice, but unfortunately the actual work there was absolutely no good.  The only thing they got right was a basic oil change. I have a 2004 Toyota SUV and I took it into Art's for the first time for some work and they replaced the shocks, did the oil change, and supposedly did some work on the brakes.  They charged us just over $1,000 for the work which was reasonable. I have no problem with that. A couple days after getting the car back it started making a really obnoxious squeaking and creaking noise when I braked, turned, went over bumps, or even got out of the car! We called Art's and took the car back.  The mechanic got into the car to listen to the noise while I drove and commented that he is \""not used to working on cars like this\"". I'm not sure what he meant, a Toyota is pretty common and basic! We left it there and it was quiet for about a day after picking it up later.  It started squeaking again, this time it was worse though.  We decided to pay and take it to Toyota AutoNation and they figured out the problem right away.  Art's had given us a defective shock that wasn't supposed to go in my type of car. I'm baffled on how they didn't realize this the second time around at Art's.  We took it back for the third time, told them what AutoNation said and showed them the paperwork, and they replaced the shock.  However, a couple days later the car was worse than ever and I was almost scared to drive it.  We gave up on Art's and went back to AutoNation.  The shock Art's used was STILL the wrong type of shock, and they told us my wheels could have come off while driving.  They also checked the brakes and apparently there was about a millimeter left on the back where Art's had supposedly fixed them.  My car is now just fine thanks to AutoNation's common sense.  I am very disappointed with Art's: It complete wast of time and money on incompetent mechanics and useless car parts."
"Of course I hiked up the Cholla trail in September.  I didn't know what to expect.  I don't think I had the right shoes to wear for this hike.  You'll need good traction if you intend to hike up the entire mountain (which is basically rock-climbing after you reach \""Helipad Plateau\"".  Be careful, the nice views show a reminder of your early death if you fall off of the mountain from fainting of dehydration or not having a strong enough grip when hugging the mountain.\n\nFIVE STAR!  This hike was so much fun!"
"BANG BANG BANG on our door at 4 am by the front desk clerk!!!  Why? Ok, let's start at the beginning.  Phoenix has an overabundance of budget adequate chain motel/hotel rooms, and we figured this was one of them.  When we arrived the day before Thanksgiving, 2011, we found a full-on construction site, so much so that we could NOT find the way INTO the hotel.  Eventually a workman snaked our way though to an incomplete lobby and we went up to our room.  AT FIRST LOOK, this newly redecorated room looked and smelled clean, and even had a somewhat upscale interior design for a budget motel. (This Ramada is becoming a Holiday Inn we were told).  But it was downhill after that.  The water was turned off and we did not have water until three hours after we arrived.  We turned on the air conditioner because it was in the 80's and the window does not open. WELL, we might as well have been in an airplane test hangar because it is SO unrelentingly LOUD that you cannot hear the TV...at all...and I have great hearing.  We eventually realized that the Air Conditioner / Heat Pump individual unit, while there IS a wall thermostat, only has ONE setting and...it is HIGH. (Lo and Med still blast at HIGH intensity).  Little by little, the fault became apparent to us...this was a cosmetic touchup, but the important things were missing like....a BATH TUB...there is no tub, just a shower with a shower head that barely yields a dribble of water....the TV is an old TUBE TV and it is blurry and scrambled and two calls to the desk (no one answers the extensions) brought no results.  Speaking of the bathroom, there is no window, no fan, and an ill-fitting toilet seat that shifts loudly to one side each time you \""alight\"".  Many have complained about their odd shoji pocket door to the bathroom which bounces back open, and clipped my husband's hand twice. As others have mentioned, there are paperthin walls APPARENTLY, because we woke up at 4 am to watch the news.  We are very conscious as we live in a condo to keep our TV down.  Nonetheless, with this HORRENDOUSLY loud wall unit air conditioner, if you want to hear the TV, you have to turn it up and we did NOT turn it up as much as we would like to, but....BANG BANG BANG on our door a few minutes after we had gotten up.   The Front Desk Clerk rudely said when I opened the door (which is freaky at 4 am) -\""The neighbors complained about the noise and I could hear it all the way down the hall\"" - **Note to Manager: GOOD LUCK RAMADA/HOLIDAY INN when it is 110 degrees outside and people have their TV's up much louder than we did to combat the a/c on UNRELENTING HIGH.  Trust me, there will be multiple complaints every night.  Other reviews of this motel have mentioned the same complaints.  I was planning on telling the desk clerk when we checked out after 3 nights about some of these \""constructive ideas\"" for their own benefit.  However, the checkout clerk looked like he was NOT open to  input (probably overdosed on complaints), so I refrained.  Basically, the owners have cheaped out on this major remodel. .  If you read this, Ramada/Holiday Inn Manager, at the very least you need to get an electrician to REWIRE the thermostat to get a  LOW FAN setting on the a/c wall unit, buy new TVs, replace the toilet seat, change out the bathroom shoji door and shoot some insulation into the walls.  And, we're just not all that picky!"
"We were so looking forward to having a neighborhood Sushi place to go to.  Service was good however the sushi was average and way over priced.  We had two hand rolls, two sushi rolls and not alcohol.  The rolls did not have an abundance amount of sushi but the price tag was $75.00 for our order.  For this I would have gone to Ocean Club!  Probably will not be going back."
"Our us airways flight from Santa Barbara to Phoenix was on time, smooth, without delay and renewed my faith in the idea of flying versus driving, etc.   \n\nHowever, my return flight shook my faith in this mode of transportation. We arrived to check in at sky harbor only to be told that it was too late to check in.  Our flight was for 5:49pm. It was 5:10pm.  We were told by our eye-fluttering attendant typing at the keyboard with a fake smile that we needed to arrive at least 45 minutes prior to departure.  We lost are already paid for seats.  Resisting the urge to grab him by the neck and bang his head on the counter to see what would fall out, I politely asked for options which he responded with two: 1) wait until 9:00 pm to fly standby 2) or depart the next morning at 8:30am.  Not wanting to wait fora hours to see if we could board an oversold flight, we chose the latter option. \n\nWhen we arrived in the morning to a chaotic crowd of passengers, there was little direction by us airways employees.  Instead they only contributed to the chaos by giving vague directions.  They wouldn't last five minutes in my classroom.  Clearly some employee training is overdue here. \n\nWhen we finally checked ourselves in, we faced gates changes, delays due to maintenance, and an ever increasing amount if disgruntled travelers surrounding us.  I'm glad it's over.  No more US Airways."
The employees were very nice and paid good attention to our table.  I do have to say that i didnt like the food.  I eat sushi at least twice a week and have an idea of what its supposed to taste/look like.\n\nI ordered the tuna nachos and I didn't like them.
"Just moved to the neighborhood, so I thought I would try this spot for lunch.  NEVER AGAIN. I had a 1/2 sandwich and soup. The Scottsdale and corn chowder poblano. The soup was just ok, usually a chowder is creamy but the soup was watery. The potatoes used in the soup very definitely a freeze dried potato or previously frozen, they definitely do not use fresh ingredients. \nThe sandwich was downright awful. The bread was grilled and left on the grill to long as it was burnt. The roast beef was a grocery store lunchmeat that was tough and chewy. The sandwich didn't have any red peppers on its as advertised, and the meat was a little blob in the middle of the bread. I was really disappointed as I love a great 'Deli\"". Unfortunately I will never eat there again."
"I've been to the Liberty a couple of times now.  This place has such a FABULOUS selection of beers, and I feel like I'm in beer heaven here.  They have a wonderful selection of both local beers and some great imports, many of which are on tap.  I've had great service both times too.  \n\nTheir food is fairly good, but I find it a bit overpriced.  It's probably related to the area, since its prices are in line with many of the surrounding restaurants.  The first time here, I had fish and chips.  The portions were large, but the fish was just ok.  The second time I had a shrimp and grits special.  It was pretty good, being more tomato-based, which surprised me.  However, the price was a little steep for the portion size, and it wasn't because of the high number of shrimp (the whole dish had five medium-to-large sized shrimp.  Overall, I love this place and plan to keep going back."
"While on Montreal for business for a few days and staying in the old town, I have bumped into this traditional polish restaurant for a casual dinner.\n\nThis is an old school classic eastern european restaurant that has lots of tradition and less novelty. \n\nThe food now, what can I say? good borsh (sour beet soup), really good pierogi (which is the polish equivalent for ravioli), an excellent polish sausage and some mighty fine polish and Lithuanian beer were sampled.\n\nbottom line: everything was good and service was great!\n\nThe atmosphere is very warm, the owners and the people who work there all speak polish, French and English. the place is very warm and features live piano on evenings."
I don't get all the fuss over this store. \n\nTo me it's looks and feels like an over priced IKEA!\n\nIt's just boring and way too contemporary for my taste. I think I could live forever without ever needing to go back in there.
"I had lunch here with 2 others for $26 on a Monday and I didn't realize I've been here before until I saw the decor. haha We came around 3p to stick around for dinner, when all the seafood and crab legs come out. For a lunch price and to get all that food it was a good deal.\n\nThe quality of food was good, both times. I think it's better than the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. There was a large variety of food all of which were good. Usually, at Vegas buffets, the sushi is crap, but at the Buffet, the sushi was pretty decent. \n\nThe stalls in the restrooms are similar to private rooms, so you can do your business in semi-privacy. You'll load up on food, mull around for an hour, chat it up, unload the load you just put in, then load up again. haha"
"I love books, hence I love libraries. I have also heard good things about the Central Library. So when my friend and I decided to go visit Phoenix, we decided to stop off and see it. I must add though that the main reason we went was because the Travel Channel did a list of the world's weirdest bathrooms, and the bathrooms at the library came in second on the list. I know what you're saying too yourselves. That could be the lamest reason to visit someplace! Now that I think about it, you are probably right.\n\nThe 1 star is for the bathrooms. The actual library gets 3 stars, because although the building is stunning, I found the inside to be disorganized and a bit dirty. Back to the bathrooms though. We went into the bathrooms and there was nothing weird about it. So we decided to ask the librarian what made it weird and he did not know what we were talking about. He then told us that if you look into a little hole in the wall dividing the entryways into the men's and women's bathrooms, you can see light from the fiber optics installed in the library. He then said it's probably cool for only about a second and that it definitely was not weird. \nAnd guess what? He was absolutely spot on.\n\nNow I don't know who to blame. Should I blame the library for installing something so dumb? Should I blame the travel channel for putting this on the world's weirdest bathrooms, or frankly creating a list of the world's weirdest bathrooms? Or should I blame myself for going to a library to see this in the first place? Ah heck, I'll blame all three."
"Occupying what used to be Nicolson's (where some of Harry Potter was apparently penned) this is a welcome change back from the site's most recent use as a Chinese buffet restaurant. The space is well lit, particularly by the setting sun at this time of year, and furnished in an understated yet quirky fashion.\n\n\n The service is prompt and pleasant and the range of wines well priced, ranging from \u00a310.95 to around the \u00a325 mark. Unusually for a modest establishment of this sort they stock a dessert wine but that's to be commended.\n\n\n Opting for the pre-theatre menu (\u00a39.95 for two courses, \u00a312.95 for three) my starter of potted duck was an ample size although more than one pickle would have been an improvement. My companion's soup of the day was pronounced a success although I've forgotten the flavour. Our main courses of skirt steak with champ & braised onions and baked feta with beetroot, blood orange and chick peas were both great (NB - this was a starter deliberately ordered as the second course) and the cheese board (brie, manchego and a soft blue) is the first I've had in a long time where the proportion of biscuits to cheese was spot on (if only Qype would award half stars that alone would have been enough for one).\n\n\n I can readily see myself revisiting here soon."
"Awesome pho here.  I usually get the #7 (Rice noodles with fresh chickens.)  Although the shrimp Pho is pretty good too.  Honestly, I have not been disappointed an anything I've had from there.  The Thai iced tea is really good, too.  When you first walk in to the place, you may think twice - it is an old taco bell converted to vietnamese restaurant.  But don't let that stop you - the food is excellent.  I've gotten a lot of people hooked on the place - even people who are picky eaters and won't try anything \""non-american.\"""
"Great atmosphere. Excellent Pork dishes.  Empanadas were really greasy, but otherwise everything was perfect."
"I had usually gone to Shepard Eye Center.  I was due for my exam, and with 6 doctors at multiple locations, the soonest they could get me in was 2 months!  I found out that Optic Gallery accepted my insurance, called them, and they got me in within 3 days!!  The service was outstanding!  Dr. Nguyen was great, and so was the staff.  \n\nI was upsold on lenses, and there is a contact lense fitting fee, but it's a small price to pay.  I chose to get the lenses that they recommended, and I choose to wear contacts too.  Just waiting until I can be a candidate for LASIK.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend them."
"This is our go-to SouthSide bar. Wings are great, burgers are excellent. Service is incredible - Jim, Erin, Kelly, Josh... All amazing people! The 2nd floor has held a bunch of our football drafts and we've rented for parties too. We love the BBT!"
"This place used to have hands down the best chili on the planet, (I know it sounds odd considering it is a bakery) but I guess they have have changed the recipe from using brisket and big vegetables to using water and ground beef. It was like water the last two times. When i asked the guy behind the counter he said \""I don't know, it's just how they send it over\"". 20 bucks for two bowls of water and two teas? No thanks."
It seems this restaurants it serves both Thai and Vietnamese food. The deco reflects such as well. Towards the front of the restaurant or some well lit tables with some large windows. Towards the back is more dimly lit tables for the more romantic atmosphere. \n\nThere is a very large selection of foods from appetizer to entr\u00e9es to desserts and even drinks. I had ordered the steam chinking dumplings. They were 6 of the biggest dumplings stuffed with a lot of meat. The grilled pork chops and lemongrass was very juicy and tender. One of the better ones I've had. I'm going to have to try the pho and Thai curry next time.
"Richard Zhao! Ask for this guy if you pay this location a visit. He's very professional, personable, and isn't pushy. Enough said."
"Wir waren das erste Mal in der Orgelfabrik (mit Freunden) und fanden das Ambiente sehr nett,das ist schon eine gelungene Idee in diesen alten Mauern zu inszenieren.\nDas ProgrammDie fetten Haare sind vorbei war sehr politisch aber auch sehr bissig und unterhaltsam,nur das Publikum etwas zur\u00fcckhaltend f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack.Nun ja\nGehe gerne wieder hin wenn entsprechendes Programm geboten wird.Kleinkunstb\u00fchnen m\u00fcssen unterst\u00fctzt werden!!!"
"We met a guy while shopping in the mall who put us on the guest list so we got in free and didn't have to wait in line (there is no way in hell I will stand in line for 2 hours). While we were waiting to be let in, we could see the line to get in. It was RIDICULOUS! Seriously, I don't know how those people could wait in that line. We get in and pass everyone up which was nice. The ambiance was cool but the place was so freakin packed it was a pain in the ass to get anywhere. We tried to dance! HA ya right! GIRLS, if you wear open toed heels, be prepared to have to bruised and sore ass toes afterwards because everyone will be stepping on them! After losing 4 of our friends, my friend and I left to grab something to eat close by.  It was nice to get away and not be stuck in a sea of people. We went back to Tao a little later and tried to dance some more but it was just too frustrating. We finally decided to leave. I agree that this club is WAY over-rated! I would have been pissed if I had waited in line for that club!\n\nTIP 1: when you go to the bathroom, be sure to flip the little switch thingy that frosts the door so people dancing and drinking at the bar don't see you peeing! My friend didn't flip it and people got a show. \n\nTIP 2: Don't drink to the point where you don't feel well. If security sees you and you like like you are going to puke, they will take you to their drunk tank! I kid you not. This happened to my friend."
"My boyfriend and I ate here because we had a giftcard, and thank goodness we did, I would never of paid for the food otherwise. Our appetizer was a greasy mess and our entrees were small and disappointing. The service was alright but the place seemed dirty. Even though this place is conveniently located near my house, I'm not returning."
"I fill in at an office near by here from time to time, and every night when I go home delicious aromas waft from their building to my nose, making me instantly hungry and causing me to break every speed limit to get home and have some dinner. Today was finally my day to try them out for lunch. I only ordered the veggie korma and a garlic naan to go, and the gentleman working there threw in some of those soggy dough nut dessert thingies, which was very sweet. Everyone was nice, my order was done on time, and the food was exactly what I had hoped for. My spice level for today was medium, which was good, but I think I'll go all the way next time. The buffet also looked great, maybe I'll go that route next week."
"I don't know what's going on with the negative reviews-- I've been here twice and enjoyed it both times. \n\nThe first time I was here with a bunch of friends for a birthday party. I ordered some sort of creamed chicken dish, which came out after a reasonable time and was pretty good. I don't know how authentic that is but it was tasty and that's all I cared about. The hot bean dip with the authentic chips is a definite plus, as is the home made spicy guacamole. The beans and rice are your standard mexican restaurant fare-- no complaints.\n\nThe second time I came here with my girlfriend. I ordered the steak colorado and she ordered the steak fajitas. I tasted both the entrees and thought it was pretty good stuff. The staff was very friendly, the view was beautiful, the prices were decent. What more can you ask for? Great place for a date!"
The owner is super nice and the environment is friendly. I got the Dylan is what it is called. Green chillies chicken bacon chipotle dressing. It came as a wrap. It is extremely delicious. I just feel the serving size was a little small. The potato salad was good. The cost was about 8 bucks for everything. From this one sandwich I wouldn't label it as the end all sandwich shop.
"Un-hip clientele.  Bar staff that are rude as hell.  Not even a good center bar to hang out at.  Why was I here all of Friday night?  I'm not really sure... oh yeah, cheap tickets to their nightclub.  All I know is I left Mirage thinking I'd only be back there to see Beatles LOVE again.  This place is so weak."
Its just OK. I like their variety in menu...and thats the only thing that i liked. I went late with my boyfriend for a late night dinner and the place wad empty ( should have known right then and there) i ordered a few things and as im eating i swear my waitress disappeared for a good 20 minutes. She didnt even give us soy sauce for our rolls and wasabi. (Screaming orgasm sauce? It was the worst ive ever had) anyhow im waiting there for my refill and no waitress for 20 minutes. The place was empty where was she? So i walk towards thw kitchen and i ask someone cleaning for the waitress and he asks me what do i need. Hahaha i need some SERVICE thats what i needed. I told the guy i wanted my check and as soon as i said that the waitress came to my table 3 times in 5 minutes. \n\nI was looking forward to this place but the service turned me off. We were the only table there but she couldnt even give us refills for 20 minutes and made us walk up to the kitchen guy for a refill and our check. \n\nUntil i try again with a different waitress? Its just wasnt worth my money tonight.\n\n---- so i go again after about a month and a half since ive written the first part of this review. Same problem but much more wait. I took my own bottle of water this time so i wont go thirsty. I ordered a few things first and i added a bowl of rice. When she came i asked for a spoon since their rice got choppy cus it was old (i know this cus im asian and know exactly how rice should be) anyhow rice was fine but i just wanted a spoon to eat it with and no joke it took 15 minutes. There was one table other than mine and there were two servers. By the time she came with the spoon it was too late i got tired from the wait.\n\nIt sucks that a place with such good tasting food has such low quality service. Sad tsk tsk.
"Really mediocre, just plain jane boring sandwiches.  They skimp on key ingredients, like cream cheese on the lox sandwich on pumpernickel, which btw the bread tastes stale and the worst pumpernickel I have ever had, not fresh or nice tasting at all.  Just really not a very good place and not very good sandwiches.  The thing that really earks me and inspired me to write the review is their cocky name Sacks \""Art of Sandwicherie\"".  There is NO art going on here, just plain boring commercialized sandwiches that sound good but disappoint.  I will never be coming back, there are much better alternatives.  Basically anything other than subway will win this place out.  What a disappointment."
"We have been here several times, since it is close to our church.  The service is consistently slow and slack.  Refills are slow and it seems to be an inconvenience for servers.  Food is sometimes ok, sometimes just cold.  You have other options, so take them.  If all you want is a beer to watch the game, then it might be ok."
"Takeda Thai is the best Thai food I have found in Scottsdale. The restaurant has a fantastic ambiance and the owners are both very friendly and attentive. They have a great variety of items on the menu and the dishes are very reasonably priced. The website www.takedathai.com has a coupon for 10% off your entire meal. Go there, eat, and enjoy!"
"I am a HUGE fan of breakfast and this was one of the best I have had in the valley.\nI had the Wolfpack and was surprised at the size of the portion after reading on here about small portions! I could not finish the whole thing!\nThe hash browns were perfect! Crispy on the outside and nice and tender on the inside.\nHubby had the Chicken fried steak, the steak was  little tough and gristly but the batter was good with an unusual flavor and the gravy had large chunks of sausage and was very tasty.\nWe ordered my 4 year old the eggs and sausage off of the kids menu and they came with a large portion of tater tots and toast. More than enough for our little guy, next time we will order a wolfpack and just share with him.\nWe decided that we would definitely go again but just not in the summer since we don't enjoy sweating while we eat."
"The oldest Students' Union building in the world. There is something to be said for that in the first instance. My students union was ...erm not the greatest and we used to normally head here for a spot of pool and a pint. I haven't been here in ages mainly because I keep forgetting about it. June/July are the best months to visit as the students are off for the summer, the festival hasnt started etc so you can get in grab a table on a sunny day. \n\nReasons to visit:\n\n- Cheap booze, \u00a39ish for 4 pints \n- Inexpensive food and its actually pretty good. 241 world cup pizza deal on just now, which one of my companions pointed out that makes it cheaper than going to lidl and buying pizza. The mama nachos were amazing. Would  have taken a picture for yall, but we just filled or faces instead. :D\n- Massive beer garden\n- Lots of seating options for different types of nights out I guess\n- Friendly staff\n\nSomething worth noting is that you may need a university student or employee to sign you in depending on the evevening."
This use to be one of my favorite pizza places till it took over an hour for my Delivery to get to me and then they charged my credit card and when it got to me they tried to make me pay cash when I already paid. I'm not happy with the service I have received from them and this will be the last time I order from them. I don't feel it is Appropriate to charge your customers twic
"Lobbys is great. I give the establishment itself three stars, it is very boring inside and atmosphere wise a little cold, but the burgers, oh baby the burgers are an easy five stars. These big, juicy, sloppy sandwiches are so freaking good. Get a double with cheese and bacon and indulge."
"Here are the things that I LOVE about Arsenal:   The Cider and Meade are spectacular; local small business; the product is always changing; there is a clear & detailed black board to tell you what you're buying; the sorbet is outta this world; tasting before buying ... 'nuff said!; the owners care about their business; it's simply a fun place to go; there's history incorporated throughout the neighborhood, establishment AND products!\n\nHere's the one thing that's not awesome:  We are not all a skip from Lawrenceville and although you may know the name of the items currently tapped (through Facebook), you won't get any information regarding sweet/dry/semi-sweet, etc. until you get there and try it.  When trying to engage through Facebook to get some of the information that is posted on the black board in the shop I was told \""You'll just have to stop in and try it!\""  That sounds very fun and all, but not-so-much when you're from Monroeville - a trip to Arsenal is a planned outing.\n\nSo, I have my three growlers and when we're having company and want to show off the local talent, I pick up a couple and hopefully one for me to enjoy.  But when it's just me and Santa Cinnamon or Honey Meade aren't tapped, --sadly-- I don't make the trip.\n\nIt's a unique place that turns flavors/taps barrels quickly.  It's more expensive than a bottle of wine, but is a true Pittsburgh experience and you don't get that from the State Store!  ...and when you stop be sure and try the sorbet!"
"We had finally gotten to the point where we were ready to stop trying new Mexican places. It wasn't that we had found the best ever, it's just that every Mexican place is essentially the same damn thing with a slight variation on the chips and salsa.\n\nFortunately, some badgering  from a neighbor got us out to lunch at Los Arcos for their lunch buffet. i think it's the first Mexican buffet i've ever come across. They've got your shells, taco bowls, beans, rice, lettuce, jalapenos and other toppings, beef, chicken, shrimp and a few pre-concocted enchilada or chimichangas, (i never really know the difference between all the Mexican dishes, but they all have the same level of deliciousness). i didn't even have to panic when the server normally asks me to choose beef or chicken for my entree, i chose beef AND chicken on my taco, i almost threw some shrimp on there. Call me loco. \ni'm not saying their food quality is all that superior to the other Mexican places, but the buffet is dinero (as in the Spanish word for Money)\n\nBonus, they have patio seating and a nice little bar area. \n\nSo why settle for the #22 combo of just 1 measly enchilada and 1 burrito with your choice of rice OR beans??  Satisfy your American tendencies and eat as much as you can with a Mexican lunch buffet. According to their web site, Monday through Sunday 11-3.\n\nHoly hell, i almost forgot, they have a life size cut out of the most interesting man in the world by the front door making for  an excellent photo op on the way out. Don't judge me."
I love petland. Most of the reviews on here sound very ignorant and like you believe everything you read on the internet. I have purchased a puppy from here and thoroughly read the warranty prior to leaving. I understood what I signed. Puppies get sick regardless of where you get them! Petland has thoroughly helped me with training and other concerns I had about getting a puppy. I'm sure I speak for many when I say petland did a great job with my newest member of the family and I will be going back again.
"This place is essentially your standard all you can eat Brazilian meat buffet.  I made the mistake of partaking in the bread, thereby filling me up substantially before the meat festivities began. I couldn't help it though, because that chimichurri sauce that comes served with the bread was so garlicky and delicious.\n\nBy the time the servers came around, I was nearly full from appetizers alone. Yes, I know I made the one cardinal mistake that one is not supposed to do when eating at an establishment such as this, but I have a weakness for the chimichurri which, by the way, goes great on the sirloin and lamb cuts."
"For the kitsch factor, for something to do for a day, this place is fine.  It's got games and the carousel bar and cheesy circus acts.  But it's dirty, it's run down, it's poorly planned, and I wouldn't stay here if my life depended on it.  (OK, MAYBE then.)  I tell people who come to visit all the time to not be taken in by the cheap rates here and at the Tropicana.  There's a reason WHY they're cheap."
"I was excited to try the food after watching a show on tv .. I tried the the Enchiladas suizas, good at first but, Chicken was hard, so much cream and cheese got tortillas soggy so much onions, should of called it Onion Enchiladas.The vegetable were ok the salad was good. My wife got the shrimp tacos kinda pricey for three tacos almost $4 a taco one shrimp and lots of cabbage the only thing that gave it flavor was the suace. I skipped the dessert . I could of ate at home save the drive and $$. First time and last ... Don't get me wrong , we were expecting an awesome flavor , but it didn't .."
It is a older hotel so you don't think of going there for the buffet right of the bat.  We somehow ended up here and the buffet was pretty good.  Not the largest selection but of what they offered everything was good quality (that's what really matters).  I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely go back.
Excellent place to eat!  We were treated with such kindness on our visit! The wonder gave us a  coffee and baklava to eat after our meal.  I ate their combo plate as I couldn't decide what to have as it all looked delectable!\n\nThey make their pita's HOMEMADE along with the hummus!  Don't MISS OUT on passing by this deli!!!\n\nAlso a MUST try is the lemonade!!!  Why???  It is sweetened with honey and rose water!
"the last time i was here 4 years ago i was still eating meat, and i fondly remember how good it was so i just have to go back. we had a bottle of the Col Solare and i love how it's not too dry and not too sweet for a red wine. for the appetizer, we had the tuna on a himalayan salt block - perfect tuna sashimi texture, and i love how you rub each slice on the block for additional flavor/saltiness. for the main course i had the grilled salmon beurre blanc - the salmon and the mussels were very fresh, and the creamy wild mushroom risotto was very flavorful. our table also ordered the deconstructed rib eye and i was told it was fantastic also. our perfect dinner wouldnt be complete without dessert, so we ordered the 6 flavor sorbet shooters (strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, coconut, and mango), and the coconut cake (im not a coconut fan but this one is very subtle, not too sweet, very refreshing). The manager, William Wilson, was very friendly and warm and attended to our whole dining experience. I recommend this place to all my friends. Very happy and satisfied customer here. :)"
Some of the best pizza I have found since moving out to Las Vegas
"CHOAS!!!! Complete and total CHOAS.  People crashing into each other, food falling on the floor, drinks spilled constantly. The food was good but the place was HORRIBLY managed or better yet completely UNMANAGED. No thanks not again. Tried the zucchini pancakes and they were good experience was awful."
"The complimentary bread and pickled beets were really yummy to start with.  But it would have been nice if we were offered seconds.  For dinner I had the barramundi fish special and my husband had the blue cheese steak.  The fish was nothing special, steak was pretty tasty.  Both meals really needed to have another side - I ordered the market veggies which came with a yummy broth. My DH had a salad.  We sat inside.  It was super crowded so not much of an atmosphere.  Our waiter was GREAT, especially considering how crazy busy it was tonight.  Even with no drinks the bill ended up being nearly $100.  Sorry, not worth it.  Should have gone to Outback for better food and half the price."
"Just got some takeout from Long Wong's this evening. They had a special going on so we got a pizza with 12 hot wings and 12 honey bbq wings. I would take LW wings over BWW and Native wings any. day. And they're hot are actually hot, so if you're not into that I would suggest the mild version. The pizza was super greasy but once we got some of it off it made for a pretty delicious meal. I can't say much about the inside or the service since I didn't pick it up, but I'll definitely remain a fan a Long Wong's."
"My new yoga spot. This is not fancy place as some other great ones I've experience Montreal, and yet I just love it. The teachers are by far the bests I've met in a while, so it  balances the fact that the studio is quite small and basic - there are no lockers, showers, or anything. It's an in-and-out kinda place, but still, the classes are just amazing. There's a great deal for new students, too. You get unlimited yoga 30 days for about 40$. You must try!"
"The Bootlegger RUINED my wedding! About 2 months ago, I inquired about the copa room for a party of 100 people. Every time I called, the event manager was not in and I was told to call back later. After a month of trying to call, one of the managers gave me the email address to contact Denise the events manager. She was out of town, so I spoke with Ron. Ron said come in any time and someone will show me the room. My mother-in-law and I went there, FELL IN LOVE with the room, and spoke to 3 people who said it was a Wednesday and its slow and no reservations have been made for 12-12-12. I finally got an email back from Denise a week later, and she told me the date is open, people have inquired, but no one put down a deposit. She also sent me a contract which stated the prices on the web site. When I went to call her, she was at a wedding show, and would not be in until monday. So Danny showed me the room again, and took my $1,000 deposit. After a few more emails trying to contact her to set up a meeting so I could pay in full the rest of the package, she emailed me back saying she would only rent the room to me if I paid $150 a person which would come out to $15,000! (because of the 12-12-12 date). I called her and basically got the reason why : Another couple who inquired AFTER I put down the deposit was willing to spend $150 a person. So I was BACK BURNER because my package was just a basic package stated on the website and they could make more off of someone else. WOW.....they don't honor their deposits! And they don't care if you have family that got invitations flying in from all over the country..... or that you hired a celebrity entertainer that doesn't return deposits. \n\nDenise did say that she would return my deposit in check form, but I paid cash so I called Danny and he pressed to give me cash back.\n\nUnfortunately,  they lost more than my business over this. A lot of people who were coming most likely would have rented the venue for business on a monthly basis. Or that they could use my celebrity entertainer as a marketing tactic. I will warn them NEVER to book the copa room because of this terrible experience. And the grooms family who have been customers since the 80's will never eat there again."
"Stopping by to say that the pistachio pavlova with chai tea ice cream and orange raspberries is divine. Out of this world. Enlightening. Splendid. I love when a chef can put together a combination that I've never heard of and makes it delicious. The pavlova has a nice crunch but is light like a cloud. The chai tea ice cream is strong on its own but mellows out and adds a nice spice when eaten with the pavlova. The raspberries add a sweet and tart note. Wow! Big enough to share, but... one hungry person could conquer this thing :)\n\nPortions are not huge, which I actually liked because I was able to try an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Usually I'm stuffed just from the entree! However, if you want to spend as little as possible and get full, this probably isn't the place for you.\n\nMinus 1 star because (1) my lobster mac and cheese [as seen on Top Chef Masters!!!] and peking duck breast were good but not extraordinary and (2) service was lackluster. The guy was okay, but he never smiled and didn't act like he cared about us at all.\n\nPS I came with a Restaurant.com certificate :)"
Service was awesome. Biblical breakfast was super yummy. Can't wait to go back and try lunch!  Check their Facebook page for specials. Iced coffee had coffee ice cubes how smart!
"THE GOOD: Ridiculously cheap rooms, speaking $35 a night. FAT TUESDAYS cheap giant everclear drinks....I may not remember much after that.  The beds were super comfy and it was clean.  Hairdresser Elvis.  \n\nTHE BAD: No one included the $5 a night \""resort\"" charge in the quoted price.  Only 2 staff members were polite to us.  One actually laughed at our friend over the phone, when she asked for more towels.  Far from the strip, but close to downtown Vegas, which we liked better. \n\nTHE HIDEOUSLY UGLY:  The topless pool at the top of the hotel.  No bar and it was full of what looked like midwestern pro-wrestler guys.  And large...LARGE women wearing no tops and thong bikinis.  I guess if you're comfortable with your body, go for it?\n\nNot bad, but I'd prefer to stay somewhere more expensive, get a nicer hotel/staff, and save $$ on the cab fare.\n\nP.S.  Why do people take their children to Vegas?????"
"First, I hate any kind of scamming. This is a bar where a lot of locals know one another. I play a lot of music in the juke box and I've been here to specifically play their great juke box and the fact they carry my beer, MGD 64. The happy hour prices are decent, $2.50 a bottle. The staff is friendly. They have 99 cent sliders on Tuesdays and Thursdays, otherwise, they don't have any reduced priced appetizers. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, between 5:00-7:00, the bottles are suppose to be $1.75. I've been in here about 10 times.  10 times I was over charged for either food and/or drinks. These were blatent over charges. I had a coupon for 35 cent wings. I ordered 10 wings. Total should be $3.50. It's not difficult to order 10 wings at 35 cents a piece. They charged me $5.75. I brought this up to the bartender and she kept debating with me that 10 wings at 35 cents each were  $5.75.  35 cents x 10= 5.75?  They follow a chart that's taped to their cash register. She kept saying I was the only person in 3 years to ever complain about the pricing of the wings!!! I said then maybe I'm the only person in 3 years to see that you're overcharging everyone. It was eventually fixed after others in the bar started hearing the conversation, but they didn't agree with me that 35cents x 10= 3.50. The last time I went in a couple weeks ago, I specifically went for the $1.75 beers between 5-7. They charged me for full price happy hour even though I was there on the \""special 1.75 day\"". I've had buy 1 get one free coupons for here, and the free meal was never taken off. I've had to correct this many times. So, I like the atmosphere. It's very casual, decent drink specials, really no food specials, and a great juke box. They do have a very small free buffet with 2 things on it, but it's always gone and not re-filled. As long as you watch your bill and prices closely, it's a decent place to go. I would've rated them a 3 1/2  if it weren't for every bill being wrong."
"They broke almost as much as they fixed.\n\nHad my Honda in to fix a power steering pump.  They fixed it,and a motor mount they claimed was broken,  but when I got the car back it made a scraping sound whenever it hit a mild bump.  That noise was not there before.  Now they say it might be the front struts.  They gave an estimate of $900 to fix something they broke.  Called national Honda, but no help there.  I am not going to pay them to fix something they broke, as that only rewards incompetence."
"We stayed here this pass Friday night and Saturday. Rooms are nothing great, but seemed clean. Like that they have a safe available in the room free of charge.\n\nWe decided to gamble there Friday night and I swear there was like one waitress working this big slot area. We moved to other machines and I flagged her down and she said she'll be right back when she dropped off the drinks to other customers. I waited and she never came back so I decided to go to another section and saw her and basically had to chase her down. Really NYNY......it's a Friday. Boo to them!\n\nGambling here is ok as they have a good slot selection and it's not bad."
"This is the first club in the desert that I've been to. Unfortunately, it was not a good experience. I was cool that the club had two dancefloors, one side playing hip hop and the other playing electronic music. The outdoor patio was spacious and had a place to get more drinks. Good thing was drinks were free. Just tip the bartender generously and you can get drinks free all night. People on the upper level were making it rain. That's a first, ever. The crowd was very diverse. \n\nNow to the music. I would say the hip hop side was poppin. That side was always packed and constantly played good music. I listen to a lot of electronic music, but had no idea what was being played that night. All night it was just continuous thumps at the same tempo. The songs lacked extra purcussions of builds or climaxes to hype up the crowd. At least play something mainstream like atb, armin, darude, David Guetta, skrillex, avicii. Artists like that."
"This summer I went to Japan, and coming back to Charlotte I've hit nearly all the Japanese restaurants and this is by far my favorite. It's very authentic including the Udon/Soba/Ramen offerings. My barometer is ordering the Octopus roll which is often a bit rubbery from the good places, full-on rubber from the bad places. Here it was tender and excellent. I could eat here every day since it's also a comfortable place. Take the time to find this place, it's definately worth it! And yes, they have a room for traditional seating with a tatami mat."
"I don't have a whole lot of experience with liquor stores, but have always been pleased here.  The staff are always nice, helpful, and non-intrusive.\n\nI once went with my boyfriend, who expressed a desire for a certain beer that they didn't have.  The dude behind the counter immediately said that they would order it.  Lo and behold, the next time we went, there it was.  We proceeded to buy lots of it.  Everything after that is kind of a blur."
"Computers were down upon check-in....we were there for one night and waited in line for \nalmost two hours while they passed out water which infuriated those around me. People want \nsomething more than water when they have to wait in line for hours to check in. Ridiculous. \nWaiting so long made it impossible to have our anniversary dinner prior to the Love show. \nAfter checking in, we really needing a drink, the bar we went to displayed Corzo tequila on \nthe shelf. We ordered Corzo and Cointreau margaritas......the waitress came back to tell us \nthat the Corzo was new and has not been priced ( why in the world would it be displayed???) \nand then went on to tell us our choices. After picking a different tequila she then told us they \nwere out of Cointreau.....on a Thursday evening at 6pm? We left and found another place that \nhad decent tequila choices yet when we chose to use the comp that was offered the manager \nattempted to refuse it. We were late for the show, I gave him what was owed beyond the \ncomp and left.  After the Love show ( which was fabulous) we went to Jet. After one drink ( \nwhich was served in PLASTIC!!!) we asked for a glass of water and the waiter told us we could \npurchase a bottle of water......really??? We asked the other bartender and we were given water \nwith no ice.  I was told, at the front desk that a manager would give me call. They took my \nnumber and it's been several days. I have yet to hear from anyone. I cannot in good faith \nrecommend the Mirage to anyone I know......."
I was under-impressed.  Stay far away from the calamari which came as a lump of fried mass of chewy something.
"\""Ok..... bare-able.... but not good\""\n\nBeen here many times... Keep trying to believe Big Bens will come thru.... Oh well\n\nFood is still par... Absolutely nothing to write home about.\n\nAnd the bar...How frustrating ..... Still charging way too much.\n\nWe truly tried, tried and tried again....   Good bye, Big Bens."
Definitely do not miss this on a trip to Vegas!! This is one of the most amazing things we were lucky enough to get to see on our short trip! And its free!!
"yep, good ol' simple home cooking, and by 'home cooking' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving.\n\nif you've never gone, don't be scared off by all the butter references, it's not that bad. the place is teeny tiny, and our table of two had to wait about 10 minutes for a place, parties of more than four, you'll probably have to get split up. \n\nthe omelettes are wonderful, and the rosemary home fries are too good. the bacon is so good.. i can't even describe it. let me stress i am NOT a pork fan, and rarely eat it. i never eat bacon from a restaurant since i'm so picky about it. everyone raved about it here, so i dived in and thought, 'what have i been missing my whole life?' ha ha, yeah, i has an awakening of pork love right in the middle of the joint! seriously, it's unbelievable.\nit's worth the trek no matter where you're coming from, especially on a sat morning. afterward we checked out a small famer's market that was going on right up the street, and then popped in Circles records and tapes, also within walking distance.\n\n***Update 3/8\nI just went over the weekend and we waited more than 45 minutes. i was ok with it, but i was with someone who does not really place value on waiting a little longer for great food, which kind of put a damper on things. def do not bring someone here who is not willing to wait for a good thing."
"$85 for 12/28/08 night, we had 2 rooms. First thing I noticed in MGM Grand was that there's no one organizing the crowds for check-in/out, everyone just had to find a lucky line to get in, like the supermarket style. Our check-in process was smooth except that we found out our rooms were hundreds of numbers apart, so we went back in line to ask for a closer distance, and the CSR replaced another room right next to each other - so why didn't he just do that the first place? Obviously that room wasn't taken. Than we bumped into a huge disappointment after we entered our rooms - bulky TV, no fridge, no blow dryer. Later I found out that my sink (not sure about the other room's) couldn't drain properly, I had pause washing my face so the water wouldn't over float... Pillows weren't comfortable either. The next morning we were waiting for elevators for over 15min (not kidding) with other 20+ ppl on the 10th floor and noticed that only 2 out of 6 elevators would open, but both were full every time they opened. Finally a janitor offered us staff elevators so we could leave but the security guard just had to ruin it. He let us in, but had to tell us how the janitors weren't supposed to offer us staff elevators because we weren't staff. We complained to the CSR when we checked out and they only wanted the security's name, but our concern was the 4 broken elevators that wouldn't open, and wanted them to deliver the msg to every staff, including securities, that guests are being trapped so pls open the staff elevators. I stayed in Tuscany twice and their rooms were big, fully equipped and new. Palms had the same price but I wrongly chose MGM Grand - bad bad choice."
"I love H&M, they are affordable and have some unique styles. I am the type that loves embellishments; give me zippers, buttons, clasps, pins, and patches on my clothes. The fact that they are using organic cotton and recycled fibers intrigue me. Their dress clothes are stiff and abrasive against the skin, at first, but after a few washes they won't irritate. They are good for work. Especially if you are looking for cheap, stylish, and you won't be heartbroken if they get messed up. \n\nH&M's casual wear is more my style. Their t-shirts and jackets appeal to my excessive need for bedazzlement.\n\nTry everything on, because they don't seem to have any standard size. I was swimming in a medium button up, but tried another style only to have it fit perfectly. This happened with jackets, under shirts, and pants. It cannot be a fluke."
"Cowboys and gangsters and mechanical bull riding and cheap booze and wet  shirt contests and random concerts and beer tub girls in ass-less chaps. How can you fuck this up? Graham Central Station is so ridiculous that it should be awesome.\n\nBut it isn't. Somehow. HOW?\n\nThis place is a huge mess. Every person in here frightens me. \n\nI guess  you could get totally hammered and try to ignore the scariness and really party here. But I can't do it.\n\nBut I dare YOU to do it. If you do go here, please tell us alllllllll about it."
"What do you expect when you see a sign for All You Can Eat Sushi for $19.95?  Less and mediocre food right?  Well that's what I expected and that's what I got! The sushi was blah and there was waaaaay more rice in the sushi rolls than there was actually fish.    So, don't get the all you can eat sushi deal unless you don't care how it tastes.\n\nOn the other hand, my friend ordered miso soup for $4.50 and that sucker was HUGE....not the typical small miso soup bowls....so that was cool.  \n\nI skipped the sushi because I had an inkling it was going to be wack, so I ordered the Ah Sin Fried Rice (which was kinda wack too....not very flavorful at all).  I also ordered the Har Gow (shrimp dumplings) and it was surprisingly good....I've had better...but it was good.  \n\nOh and they charge you for hot tea ($8 for a pot that serves 5 people easily)."
"Worst customer service! After waiting close to 2 hours for one pizza, I waited an additional 10 minutes on hold when calling to find out what was going on with my order. I hang up and then call back. A different person answers and asks to put me on hold...I tell her no. She says there are multiple lines ahead of me and that she is there alone making pizzas. I said \""miss, you're not alone. Another guy answered the phone ten minutes ago.\"" She said current wait time was an hour to an hour and a half. I said its been almost two hours to which she replied she was sure my order was on its way. I said check please to which she said she did and that its on its way. And then added they are really busy because of school lunches. I said \""not my problem miss. If you can't handle the volume, don't take it on.\"" Pizza is still not here btw...don't use this store!!!"
By far the worst car wash I've used. My car ended up worse coming out. I had to go to the gas station next door to wipe down my windshield since there was soap streaks all over it. It looked like my car was rained on and left to dry. Save yourself the time.
"Getting into Tao VIP status is pretty easy, and when you don't have to pay to get in it makes it that much better inside when you have an extra $20 something in your purse.  And you still have your pre party buzz cause you didn't have to wait in that ridiculous line!!\n\nI went to Tao 2 nights in a row (don't ask) and Saturday was def more packed than  Friday.  My friends and I scored on a booth Saturday with some really fun guys, and did most of our dancing there since the dance floor is PACKED. We attempted to get though the crowd and didn't even have to move, the crowd literally pushed us to the other side. And then...Timbaland's \""The Way I Are\"" came on, foam comes down from the ceiling, the crowd goes wild!! It was insane and kinda scary.  \n\nNot too sure about the girls in the tubs its a little weird I think to have people rubbing up on each other in still water...ew.  \n\nSo long story short, get there early if you are going to have to wait in that line, best bet always is to make friends with someone who can get you in no line no cover...nice club, not extremely \""wow-ed\"" but gotta give 4 stars for the booth hook up!"
"Oh Yeah!!! Thank you Yelpers for helping me find this gem. Definitely a home run in many ways. It sits at the head of an executive office complex. Attending a Research Chefs convention and needed to find the best of the best. Since I was with the\""meat group\"" I needed to find a good steakhouse that didn't let me down. This is it. Three of us had the bone in filet which is excellent. The bone in NY Strip and KC Strip are the same and my guest was somewhat disappointed. Had the seafood tower which they created for the 6 of us. Everyone had oysters, lobster tail, crab claws, king crab and jumbo shrimp. That would have been enough for dinner. Our top meathead had the bone in ribeye which is a hard to find item in many restaurants. Even for a guy from Kansas City. For sides we ordered the sauteed mushrooms and lobster mashed potatoes. Served family style. Dessert was amazing as well. Huge pieces of chocolate cake, 3 large scoops of ice cream and I had my usually Mexican coffee served with fresh whipped cream. And to top things off, at the bar we ran into some ball players there for spring training. My customer and I got a pic with Rickey Henderson which capped off the night. They drove us back to our downtown Phoenix hotel in their Escalade."
This place is rowdy and awesome!
"It's very loud in here.  Also at 1100 pm Sat nite I was surprised to see a table of 3 with a child clearly under 5 in the booth.  The tv that covered our booths was not operational.  Our tasty $13.99 kobe beef burgers were ordered medium but were more rare.  Other than that, our waitress was very hard working & even brought us a basket of hot beer battered fries since we had to wait for our burgers to be re-done."
"JESUS! I walked into pastry heaven! Which was handy since my one and only goal was to obtain a Cannoli.  As I stood in front of a counter that was positively brimming with delicious-looking pastries, nowhere could I find cannolis. Oh. Sh*t. After doing a second scan of the counter, what do I see tucked away on the second shelf, left side? ONE cannoli. I guess my panic soon became evident because before I knew what was happening, I was shouting \""Oh my God, D! There's only one left!!!'  When I heard the ladies behind the counter chuckling, I realized that I really had exclaimed those words aloud. They reassured me though - they had a secret stash in the back. Praise the good Lord for the Cannoli fairies. \n\nThe goods: Well, I only bought a Cannoli and it was excellent. Perfectly crunchy on the outside, nice and creamy on the inside - not too sweet. Perfeto. That said, they had a ton of pastries from whole cakes that were so pretty I would hate to be the one to cut into them, to individual pastries, tarts, cookies, Marzipan lambs (if you're in the market for those), HUGE lobster tails and other assorted dessert things to make you nice and plump. I seriously doubt that you could walk in here and not find something to eat. If you can, there's something wrong with you. \n\nLocation: On Dante, across the street from the church. What church? I can't recall so you're going to have to map it using the infamous Yelp app because guess what? There are lots of churches in Little Italy. \n\nThe decor sort of looks like the shop was frozen in time - maybe in the late 60s or early 70s - but don't let that throw you off. You're only there to eat."
"It was my first time at TAO beach and I must admit, I was VERY disappointed! The music that they played wasn't as hyped up as it was supposed to be, it smelled like poo the whole entire time, and there weren't a lot of good looking people around! A lot of people there looked like hot messes; it's definitely something you see straight out of Jersey Shore! Plus, the pool is so small; I am a tiny girl and even I had a hard time trying to squeeze in!\n\nHowever, regardless of TAO beach, what I can tell you fellow Yelpers is to check pool/tanning area outside TAO. People out there are much more friendly, compared to TAO beach, and plus it's more classier! If you are the type that wished that they were a part of the TAO beach party because of the loud hype, you can certainly still party out in the pool area if you are tipsy because it's VEGAS."
"Haven't had a bad meal yet! They are always hopping and you sometimes have to wait a bit for your food...but it is so worth it!!\nThe food is a little high priced, but groupon has deals often.\nTheir chili is fantastic, whether you use it for your fries or just get the chili bowl with onions and cheese. The chicken club sandwich is tender and all their burgers are more than filling."
I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend. I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food. Little Italy did not disappoint!! I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!! Plus the service was great too. Fast and friendly.
There is a special place in my heart for Dean & Deluca. This location is nestled close to my family's home so I come here pretty often with my mom.\n\nAt times can be pricey but you're in a D&D... \n\nAt the deli I usually split the turkey sandwich with avocado and alfalfa sprouts (HUGE) and split one of their salads too...heaven!\n\nSit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful Charlotte weather.
"UPDATE: Someone (who just joined Yelp btw) sent me an extremely abusive email via Yelp re: my negative review. Whoever this person is, firstly, doesnt speak/write english properly, and secondly, makes threats that are ridiculous (I.e Tina will kick my ass if I ever went back to her cafe?!) Are you kidding me?! First of all, i will never ever go back there, unless I'm needed by the Health Dept. to testify against this establishment, and second, don't ever threaten me, especially when I'm giving my honest opinion. Have you heard of freedom of speech? Sounds like Tina has a posse, but that is all she'll ever have when she loses her business due to dubious business practices! \n\nHands down, absolutely the worst dining experience I've ever had. We only stayed because we were already there, and I had purchased a Groupon, wow what a waste. We sat down, and weren't even acknowledged for at least 10min. Then, the menus came about 20min later. So, about 30min of total wasted time. Maybe they were hoping we would read the disgustingly dirty book that was on the table on Ethiopia? It's a great idea, until you realize it's not practical at all for a restaurant. Forget that our copy was from 1964. I'm sure even Ethiopia has changed since then. \n\nMoving on to the ambiance/decor. Absolutely, disgusting and dirty. It's old, owner's kids were playing in and out of the kitchen (hello??), the kids' high chair (which was a regular high chair, not a restaurant style) was so disgusting, I had no idea what to do with my baby. \n\nFood. OMG. The amount of food you get is meager. I'm not kidding. It's a tiny little portion, probably about 3 tablespoons? It came out cold and it looked like someone had thrown it up. I had ordered the biggest plate that combined most of the foods (which by the way, there are only 15 on the menu, and they were out of 4 of them), and my husband had ordered his own plate. After we patiently waited for the food, the server (who had no idea what was going on) came out and asked us if it's ok for them to put my husband's order on my plate. What? Why? But we said \""fine\"" b/c frankly, we wanted to just leave! In any case, the amount of my food was reduced by what my husband's food took up as space, which is not much, believe me. The quality of the food was just subpar. Cold, not tasty and lacking in meat.The \""bread\"" was wet and sour, and I don't believe that's how ethiopian bread is. Some entries were beef and chicken, but you wouldn't have known it if it wasn't indicated on the menu. There were probably 2-3 TINY pieces of chicken/beef over all, I'm not kidding. (I wonder if it's b/c I told them we had a Groupon in advance, and they just gave us a tiny amount of cold food with no apparent presence of meat.) \n\nService was just horrible, and the girl (was she the owner, or maybe the owner's daughter?) who waited on us at first, had no people or service skills. The boy who came in late apparently, was out second server, and he mentioned it was his second day, so he had absolutely no idea what to do. It was so sad to watch, really. The woman was just awkward. I wondered if there was something behind the scenes (in the kitchen) we weren't aware of, that was making the people working there completely incapacited. I also thought that if this restaurant can survive, anyone can be in the restaurant business apparently. \n\nI have traveled a lot, and am open to and love other cultures (I, myself, am not American), but this was by far not a tolerable or pleasant experience in any way. Looking at their website, you would think they are a well-established and clean business  but make no mistake, they are absolutely not. I am actually surprised they are still operating, and have a license. My husband and I wondered how long they will stay open, he gave them a month (but I have no idea how long they've been open for already.) Either way, we will NEVER ever go back there and waste another dollar. Please don't waste your money."
"I've been going here for about 4 months now and have seen great results. They keep a fast paced creative workout, only 30 mins in most cases. For as many times as I've gone, 3 x week for 4 months, we always do a new exercise that keeps things from being boring. Of course the workout are targeted and they keep a log of everything. \n\nIf you can afford it the personal assistance can't be beat. I was in ok shape going in, and it is still a challange everytime. \n\nAll the trainers are pros, i worked with Jason and he is patient and professional."
"Found bleach spots on 2 shirts. Went in 4 times to get it resolved because the manager wasn't there the 1st 3 times. Then she said \""we don't use bleach and we didn't do this\"". Well I sure didn't ruin my shirts for fun, nor do I like to frequently stop by a place repeatedly for giggles. The manager/owner turned her back and walked away. Me= a couple hundred dollars down the drain. Nothing I can do and nothing they are willing to do or admit. DO NOT GO HERE!!!"
"I wasn't impressed with the hotel.  You cannot control the A/C int he room.  There is only a high or low fan setting, so in hot Las Vegas you come home to a hot room. \n\nNo coffee maker or mini bar in the room...what, it's Vegas?  You need coffee and alcohol!  The internet was a cord that you had to reach across the room to use, and there were two of us trying to work and could only do it one at a time.  Cell phone and 3G service is non existant in the room too.  \n\nI'll come back to LV, but will definately stay somewhere else!"
"I treated the husband for a birthday staycation this weekend. The staff was great from all angles. We got picked up in the parking lot by the golf cart driver to bring us to the lobby. The front desk had a seamless and simple check-in. The concierge was very helpful in answering my questions regarding transportation options into Old Town (I didn't want to worry about having some cocktails and driving back). Of note: their towncars will drop you off anywhere in Old Town for $21. \nTheir rooms are so pretty-I really love the simple, modern, sleek style. We didn't get to take advantage of the Release Pool Party this time around as it was raining, but it's free for hotel guests. Nice views of the desert too from our room."
Rude staff... Way over prized. Spent $60 on two drinks and two servings....
"I took my son here because I was told by a friend that they could help with foreign objects in eyes.  This meant a lot to me because the last time I took my son for this issue to an urgent care, they told me that they couldn't help me and sent me to the ER to be taken care of.  The people at this urgent care were very nice and treated my son very well.  The service was quick and when the doctor prescribed an antibiotic, they told me that they could fill it right there at the urgent care for me!  It was ready for me before I was done checking out!  This is such a awesome thing to do for people because taking a sick kid to a pharmacy after they already spent an hour or more at the doctor is never fun.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that the room I was in needed some repair.  The electrical outlet cover was completely missing from the wall in the room I was in.  I can't believe a medical facility would leave such an obvious hazard like that!"
"Totally hole in the wall type of restaurant. \n\nI had a calamari appetizer and pad thai. The calamari was really good but the sauce needs to be a bit spicier. The pad thai was not great, the noodles was too chewy. I thought it was undercooked. \n\nThe price is perfect, not that expensive for their lunch specials. BUT quality is just not that good for me."
"Crap.\n\nCrap crap.\n\nCrap.\n\nIs that not sufficient?  Do you need more than that?  Okay: go there and order a reuben, and see what happens.  First, they'll ask you what type of bread you want.  On my reuben?  I'll take rye, because if it isn't rye then it's not a reuben.  Thank you.\n\nThen they will include lunch meat-style corned beef, which just pisses me off.  Because it doesn't taste delicious, it tastes like what you get from a cafeteria.  And then they have thick ass bread, which, in my opinion, is what you put on a sandwich when you don't want people to realize that what's in between the slices of bread sucks ass.\n\nOr, the nachos.  They use movie theater cheese (which is a one-star bonus for me, only reason they have 2 stars) but the chili is totally tasteless.  I don't get how people can cook something like chili and send it out to the world when it tastes like nothing.  Not bad, not good, just *nothing.*  Here's a tip: find something that tastes and heave it into the pot.  Just a thought.\n\nI hate myself for being convinced to go here over slices.  Because the place sucked a fat one."
"I think this place is a lot of fun.  It's in a nice complex that's not your standard strip mall.\n\nI've been 2x and both times were fun for dates.  They had live music...and a good wine & beer selection (not just bud light).\n\nI have not had too much food so will not comment.\n\nThe atmosphere is cool -  sofa and chairs, a bar...or standard tables.  but, it's a funky cool place.............and we just don't get that too much in Chandler."
"The graffiti etched elevators should be your first clue this place is low rent scuzzy.\n\nThe whole place felt slimy and like any ordinary shopping mall in decline - definitely not worth visiting in a place like Vegas with so many better options.\n\nI agree with other reviewer, the place smelled like bathroom throughout."
"I really don't understand how they still on business, they don't care about the customers that go in the store AT ALL, I order some cupcakes for my sons bday and cancel them after I think of my experience after I left the store. The owner of the store really have to do something."
"Best porterhouse steak ever! Juicy tender and flavorful.  Though it is kind of expensive, it is worth it for the experience.  The Bone Marrow we added was really good.  It came in a bigger portion than we expected.  I would say sharing that with 3 or 4 people is best.  It starts to taste  a little overwhelming when your eating too many at once.  Remember to eat these while their still hot, they taste oilier as it gets colder.  It was really good. \n\nThe only thing I would complain about was that the cream of spinach was too salty.    Other than that, i'd come back for good yummy steak.  My favorite steak place so far."
"Visited for a full set of silk nails, she automatically put acrylic on my nails not the silk I had asked for. I didn't ask for them to be taken off because the whole point of silk nails is they are less damaging than acrylic but when I told her I asked for silk she said I asked for acrylic. I would never say acrylic if I wanted acrylic I would just say full set. So I didn't argue but my acrylic nails turned out very thick and bumpy. Had to go to another salon to they them thinned up and smoothed out. She also left them very long after I asked her to cut them shorter and made my cuticles bleed. After I pulled my hand away she said she was doing it on purpose because my nail sea are too short so she was \""helping me\""."
"Try the chicken and fried beef, this place is your traditional Cuban joint and one of the few that is really good in this area. Be prepared to wait a little while, but that is usually standard at most authentic Cuban places. You will not leave hungry.  They have a live band on weekends."
"Come for the Dim Sum.  Arrived 11am and it was fairly busy.  Full of Asian families taking their time and enjoying themselves.\n\nAmbience - Clean, well lit and noisy like most Dim Sum places.  Open kitchen which is somewhat unusual and a good thing.\n\nPrice - Ordered 1 A item and 4 B items plus 2 Tsin Dao beers ($7) for a total lunch of $22.38.\n\nService - Funny start when they tried to make me take a menu (I'm only part asian so I guess they wanted to make me order ala carte food).  After that it was good.  The hostess seated me right away and the food carts rotate quickly and consistently.  I hardly finished each plate and it was whisked away.  Busboy offered me a second beverage before I had to ask anyone for another.\n\nFood - Excellent selection sorted by food types: baked and fried goods, steamed goods, large sides (like fried rice), dessert and fresh beverage.\n\nPork Shui Mai - Good flavor but slightly chewy (like a typical chicken texture).\n\nBBQ Pork Bun Baked (Char Sui Bao) - Perfect bun texture and flavor with a tasty glaze coating (your hands will get sticky).  Stuffing of bbq pork was tasty.\n\nPork Dumpling (gau style not pot sticker) - Must have! great crispy dough contrasts with lightly chewy stuffing.  Lightly sweet flavor is delicate and delicious.\n\nChar Sui Bao steamed - Great flavor but dough wasn't my favorite (stick to the baked ones).\n\nShrimp dumpling (Har Gau) - Good sized value with sticky wrapper and delicately spiced shrimp filling.  Each one must have at least two 10-12 shrimps in it.\n\nDidn't try the fried rice, dessert cart or the fresh juice cart (soup or beverage?).  They also paraded around an asparagus plate that looked and smelled wonderful but I was too full.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the quality and value of this place and would recommend it.  I'm picky about Dim Sum and this place does a decent job on everything I tried and better than average with the Baked BBQ Pork Bun and Ha Gau."
"We came here on December 23rd, after failing to find a local kebab store that was open.  I remembered the amazing mosaic sculpture and told my buddy, let's try the place with the big Dia de los Muertos lady on the front....and we did.  The Mayan taco was ....well...to use the term orgasmic would be both an understatement and a poor use of the word.  I took my parents there 4 days later and had a similar experience. My dream dinner there is to have many friends, many hours, many many tacos, and many beers or margaritas.  I am impressed with the food quality, but haven't had the beans or rice, I figure why?  They have tacos.  Also, impressive salsa bar with a pink radish salsa that I wanted to drink out of the bowl.  Yes, this is a hedonistic review, but I had a hedonistic time.  Go eat here.  They must never go out of business."
"I read the Yelp review before I brought my family there.  However, unlike it mentioned in the reviews, this is a premium steakhouse located in a  5-star Marriott Resort next to its Pro golf Shop.  Most of its customers are business people and casual dressing is not recommended although it is not prohibited.  Main courses (steaks) are amazing and priced between $38 and $50.  Therefore, it shall be a $$$$ (over $60 pp) instead of $$$ restaurant.  You can choose the salt among 6 different styles of sea salt and 5 different kinds of steak source.  The menu is ala carte therefore, sharing side and appetizers are common.  The $17 appetizer \""tower of sea food\"" is well-worth its price, that includes half lobster, 2 oysters, 2 jumbo shrimps, 2 crab legs.  The steaks and seafood are perfect.  Unfortunately, Arizona law prohibits customer to bring their own wine, which is not accustomed by Californian like us.   The waitress and waiters service is 5-star.  After all, we had a great dinner with higher price that was not originally expected."
Food is killer finger licking delicious\nservice is good\nthey have live music\ngreat beer choice\na must
"Waste of time and money. May be kids might like it but really the blue man group's talent is not derived from them but the band playing in the back drop. The band was excellent but blue man themselves a Big disappointment. Please don't spend money on premium seating.. Category A, if u do land up going cheap seats will do."
"Pushing the boundary of the Chinese buffet.\n\nGenerally I'll visit an establishment at least three times prior to writing a review.  A second or third visit to Mike Kwan's Gold Coin would be of surprise to me. CASH ONLY, with tax included $6.15 paid for my admission to this buffet-style meal.  Kid's under the age of four eat for $2.  It was surprisingly busy.\n\nThe \""buffet\"", in its entirety:\nWon-Ton Crisps\nFried Rice\nChow Mein\nMixed Vegetables\nFrench Fries\nEgg Roll Halves\nFried Chicken\nHot Wings\nSweet & Sour Pork\n\nHere in lay my greatest criticism; Yes, technically, there is more than one Chinese item among the food set out in large trays for an individual to return to as many times as they like.  In no other way does the Gold Coin overlap with common consumer expectation of a \""Chinese Buffet.\""  So, why was it so busy?  Because, for a tick north of five bucks a person could gluttonously stuff themselves with the above items; it is better thought of as an economical \""family-style\"" meal.  If it was advertised as such, I bet Mike's would get better reviews as people wouldn't feel mislead when they walked in, and the balance of Chinese, to American, to Italian, to Mexican to whatever cultural dishes would be freed up as well.  It has its redeeming qualities, which is why it didn't get the single start rating; it's clean, inexpensive, and seemed like a friendly casual atmosphere."
"I was a little worried for this location when they first opened b/c my husband, friends, and I didn't think the food was as good as the Firefly on Paradise.  Being that this Firefly is so close to our house, my husband and I went back to give it a shot during happy hour.\n\nI'm happy to say that months after opening, the food is just as delicious as it is at the other Firefly locations, and they are still always busy!  Definitely make a reservation, and if you can...get there early!  \n\nLittle tip...since it's a tapas restaurants, the portions are snack size.  Order just a couple at a time so the food stays hot and you can stop when you're full.  And check them out during a happy hour.  All drinks are half off including pitchers!\n\nWe especially love the Blood Orange Mojitos, any of the Sangrias, the Steak and Mushroom Skewers, the Mussels, the Clams (are BOSS!), the Empanadas, the Albondigas, and the Mac n Cheese is great here too.  Really anything you order from here will be awesome!  Oh and for dessert, be sure to try the Banana Nutella and the Bread Pudding!  YUM!"
I recently got married in Vegas and requested that all guests and family members stay at the Platinum for the wedding. I called in months in advance and got a great rate for the group. The hotel was absolutely perfect! When we arrived and told them we were there for our wedding we were automatically upgraded to a Princess Suite (at no additional cost). The room was massive! The bath tub was HUGE! The Platinum is a non-gaming/smoking hotel which actually has a nice feel to it. And the fact that you can go straight to your room without having to walk thru a smoky casino was definitely a perk. \n\nThe Platinum has a Spa located on the 4th floor. Me and all of my bridesmaids went there on the morning of the wedding to have our make-up done and they did and excellent job! Danielle did my make-up and she made me feel soo comfortable and helped me to get over my wedding day jitters! I definitely plan to spend more time at the spa on my next visit to Vegas. \n\nThe one down side is that the hotel only has valet parking so there was some delay in picking up the car. But the valet attendants were very pleasant and helpful.

"Eww. I ordered a cheeseburger from this spot, & was so grossed out by what they served up. Not normal, even for the low standards Wendy's has conditioned us to accept. For $1 a cheeseburger you might as well go to Waffle House, always open with $1 cheeseburgers too. At some point, customers will need to wake up to the fact that they are not in the business of serving good quality food for reasonable prices, they just want to take the money, & will leave you with a bag of nasty crap the dog shouldn't eat if that's what they think it takes to get your $1."
"The lady that served us made our experience that much better. Their wine choices are excellent. \n\nHad the calamari and fire and ice for an appetizer \n\nThe bread they serve can be addicting and I had the fried chicken for dinner. \n\nFor wine had the Cabernet, Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot noir and were all excellent and for Desert the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake is a game changer\n\nWill be coming back  \n\nOn Sundays they have unlimited bloody Mary's starting at 10am for only $10"
"I love museums--art, natural history, human history, culture. A lot of people think you've seen one, you've seen them all. But this place tops the list. We had the pleasure of coming the first day it reopened to the public after the renovation. It's absolutely beautiful. The mix of modern and historic is amazing. I especially loved the modern art fixtures dispersed throughout the Scottish pre-history exhibits. \n\nYou can tell the curators love Scottish history and want the visitors to love it, too. They do an amazing job of conveying that the Scots are their own people with their own unique history and culture. It's amazing to see artifacts found in old properties throughout Edinburgh. It really gave me a sense of how old Edinburgh really is. Among my other favorites: Dolly the sheep; the working steam engine; and the amazing sample books of Scottish textiles. \n\nNow all I need is someone to invite me an event here!"
I would not go to or order a pizza from this place. Raw pizza when asked for well done. Employees have a bad attitude the worst pizza restaurant in Southern Nevada. I will never go back to this place.
"The food tasted good, but everything else about dinner tonight was awful. \n\nThe waitress forgot some of our food and didn't bring my order to me the way I asked. After that, she brought us the check and refilled our drinks, but then we never saw her again. After a while I was thirsty enough that I literally got up, went behind the counter and refilled our drinks myself. No one noticed. After about an hour a new waitress came by and offered refills -- leaving our two empty dirty cups on the table but finally removing the dirty dishes. Over the course of more than two hours we were never asked if we wanted to order anything else. To top it off, two of the stalls in the women's restroom were completely out of toilet paper."
"I had a burger here, yes a burger at a sushi place kinda weird huh? It was amazing spicy and amazing.  Trust me please trust me."
These people love what they do and it shows.  One of the best places in Madison for a create your own deli sandwich - hot and cold.\r\n\r\nHigh quality natural and organic meats and cheeses help this deli stand out. And the customer service! These guys are fantastic and totally into what they're doing - making for a fun visit. \r\n\r\nI love Artamos Deli.
"I have never been to one of these chains before.  So stopped in for lunch to pick up a salad to go.  A plethora of options for salads, which is the point of a salad buffet.  Decent price and it was super clean (always important)."
"This place taught me all my basics as a competive swimmer when I was 10 years old although it's difficult to advance they only move up the kids that they like and can be a little biased, but what annoys me is that there is no challenge in the lesson it's way to easy and if competive swimming is really what you like then you need someone to really push you and make you uncomfortable so that you can become a better swimmer although lifetime swim really offered that to me!"
"I previously saw the mus.i.c show at the MGM Grand and wasn't sure if there was going to be a big difference compared to the show at Monte Carlo.  But since I enjoyed the show so much the last time, I decided to go watch it again.  If you get tickets early, you can probably find some discount through the Monte Carlo website, I got my tickets for 30% off.  I definitely recommend sitting in the main floor close to the center aisle so that you get a full view of everything that's going on.  \n\nThe show is a bit different from the show at the MGM, the production value is higher so the costumes and the set got an upgrade.  If you've seen the show at the MGM, the story line is about the same but they added some new routines and the best part, they took off their masks at the end =), not sure if they are doing that at the end if every show or what but they didn't do that before.  \n\nThe Monte Carlo theatre is bigger and the seats are like the movie theater seats (all individual).  At the Hollywood theatre at the MGM, some seats were in a booth and they packed 6 people into one tiny booth and it was a uncomfortable but the Hollywood theatre was smaller so it felt more intimate there.  But definitely check this show out =), the tickets are very reasonable for a Vegas show, they even have meet and greet passes but no discount for those =(."
"Stayed here in March, asked for a upgrade to a fountain view, the view at night was unreal. Although it was easy to get to the Bellagio and the Aria, walking  to the Cosmopolitan was a maze."
"I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. \n\nThe sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say \""sacrificed or as important\"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). \n\nThe venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, \""don't wear pants,\"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly \""cooler\"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? \n\nThe answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. \n\nHate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms."
Convenient location. Pork barbecue: Tasty. St. Louis ribs. Sauce: Tangy.
"I was not home when he arrived, so my wife dealt with him. He was totally professional, even when I called to set up the appointment. He has a great sense of humor and seems like a good guy. He eradicated my bug problem in and outside. I have not seen a bug of spider for three months. I saw my first last night in my kitchen. Since the whether is changing for the colder I know varmints are going to want to come inside. I will soon call for him to make another visit. He is also very affordable."
"Wish I could have wrote a better review about this place. The mechanic i spoke with Was a nice guy an i felt confident the work would be quick and easy. I had some repairs on my truck. I was expecting it to take a couple of days and was expecting to spend up to a grand. The work was done and the vehicle passed emissions. BUT, within a day of getting the vehicle back the check engine light came on and now my a/c does not work. I popped the hood to see about the battery (as it was suppose to be replaced, it was) and under the hood there were bolts sitting on the side by the battery. I have no idea if they belong to my vehicle. There was also a rag tucked on the other side of the hood. The plastic cover on my neg. battery cable was sitting by the valve cover instead of being put back on or discarded. And the wiring harness which was accessed during the repair was not rewrapped and the wire that was worked on was completely exposed. I wanted to take the truck back but I was pretty soured on the lack of care for the work that was done. I will keep looking for a mechanic that gives me more bang for my buck."
"Spazzing bartender started a shouting match with some friends of mine. If you like the smell of sewage over cigarette smoke, then this place is for you."
"ok first of all... lets just start out by saying I am from LA... and lucky for me we have Chinatown and the entire San Gabriel Valley a.k.a. China! Now maybe Vegas just doesn't have too many authentic chinese restaurants but damn this was the worst dim sum I have ever had in my life! My friend took me there 2 weeks ago and well the name kinda threw me off to begin with but once I tried the shu mai... damn it was over! I didnt want to try anything else. The simplest dim sum and yet they couldnt even get it right. The beefballs were too overcooked too!  Even the tiny little pork buns were to run from. How does this place stay in business? But then again maybe they are catering to a different crowd. What really struck me as weird was the fact the place was full of asians! I mean, is this suppose to be as good as it gets in Vegas for dim sum? If so, I'd rather stop by a trader joes and pick up a pack of frozen shu mais. You will have much better luck going to the frozen food aisle at a supermarket for good dim sum. Oh one more thing.. horrible service. The employees are literally fresh off the boat! I guess thats the only thing authentic about this place, their workers! hahahaha Trust me when I say I will never come back here or recommend this to another soul.. unless i hated them and wanted to waste their money! =D"
"I'm really glad these tickets were free because I knew it was a dud the first 10 minutes of him going on and on just talking about the whole 'mentalist' background. This show couldn't have been over soon enough, a real disappointment and not at all entertaining. Skip it!"
"I'm adding to the chorus of \""the people here are incredibly rude.\"" They have this policy that you must leave behind two yards of fabric or you have to buy all of it - except it's not exactly uniformly enforced. I went to buy fabric today to make blankets for gifts, and it took me ages to sort through the leaning tower of fleece just to *find something that was at least a yard*!! There were so many pieces of fabric that had to be just six inches, 10 inches, maybe a foot and a half...hardly anything you can use for almost any sort of project. \n\nWhen I *finally* found something that was at least a yard and had a cute pattern, I took it to be cut. The woman cutting my fabric insisted I had to get additional yards of one type that I didn't even need because otherwise I'd be leaving a yard behind here and there and that was against their policy. She didn't even explain it nicely, she just said \""did you read the paper?\"" and pointed at it. I would've just returned those pieces and went back to get alternatives from the giant pile, but I had spent so much time finding at least a yard each that I was now running late.\n\nSo now I have FAR more fabric than I needed and I feel super ripped off. They have a good selection, but I'm not going back. It hardly matters if the fabric is decently priced when you have to cross your fingers and toes you'll find at least a yard of it, and then end up paying out of the rear for extra. Ugh."
"The lady at the front desk has an attitude. Food is ok. Not great stuff worthy of a 20 min drive.. bad service. Ok Ok food. I have had buffets here, and they are useless.  There are many restaurants in Charlotte which are waaaay better for the price and service. There are a few things good on the menu - the south indian platter - but not sure if you would like all what is served in it. We had the masala mysore dosa - which was literally floating in OIL and the know-it-all lady said, \""No, this is how it is.\"" \n\nI am from South, I eat dosas for breakfast and dinner and have been eating for 27 years! Are you kidding me? No acknowledgement, nothing. She had to prove that she was right. I am never going back to this restaurant. I also had the gobi manchurian - waay salty and hard as rocks! Really man? Can't even bite into that thing. I have repeatedly given this place a chance, 4 times so far, and never has it been good. Will not go here. Too many options at Charlotte where food is better, cost is lower, service is better."
"The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party, so it's not just my opinion- when we told them to try it, they said it suits out taste and refused to cancel the charge until after thirty minutes of disputing with them. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. (Btw Chinese people at our table so they actually know what it's supposed to taste like)"
"By far, THE BEST breakfast buffet in Vegas. They've got it all.\n\nBenedict, Crepes, eggs, all meats, wonderful desserts. I would not suggest this buffet at dinner time, but for lunch, you CAN NOT MISS IT!"
"Came here with a bunch of girlfriends for brunch and I must say this was one of the best brunch buffets I have been to in a very long time.. Everything was made fresh, tasted good and the servers were helpful and attentive.  My favorite station was the crepe... both savory and sweet made to your liking... everything tasted delicious!!  never a long line and many different types of food to please any palette.\n\nCute decoration makes you think you are sitting in a lil cafe in a village in Paris... very nice touch.  Very satisfied for coming here and will definitely be back."
Best BBQ in charlotte the place looks great. Service is always great I love that a lot of the waitress's are covered in tattoos. The BBQ is a great mix of all styles. My favorite is the ribs. They have a very respectful beer selection as well.I would give it five stars but the tables are cramped and I always get bumped. But it's worth it so we come here often.
Went there recently for a half a sandwich and salad on their lunch special.\n\nMy only complaint is that it's relatively pricey. Overall I would say that it is definitely worth it when you factor in the amazing service and the variety of fresh ingredients.\n\nDefinitely try it!
"The deli and restaurant are my favourite lunch spots in town (although all of it's incarnations are great choices)\n\nThe menu is very varied with plenty options for even the pickiest of eaters. The food is always tasty, fresh, hearty and healthy.  They always seem to get the perfect flavour/combination of flavours! Portions are generous and definitely good value for money.\n\nStaff are all very friendly, knowledgeable and happy to meet your needs and answer any questions about their dishes.\n\nFor a healthy and satisfying meal, you won't find better. The Deli also offers a take-away service which comes in very handy for an office lunch."
"I love my Chicken Sald with the cilantro dressing, and there new carnitas tacos. ummm. ummmm, ummmm, ummmmm, ummmm!\nI've been getting the same thing for a long time until the taco came out.  lol  I usually stick with what I really like."
The Buffet is fantastic!
This is a healthy place to be ... Salad and pasta galore and many more! First time my parents introduced me to this place i just had to go there weekly ... call me a fatty but i would have two plates at a time ... I even go for seconds ... filling my plate up with potato salad caesar salad and another one but i forgot the name. Its like an asian style like salad with fried wonton and almond nuts i think. \n\nPlace wise is clean. The staff seems very welcoming. One thing I don't like is the water ... its like water from a faucet. Not that i've tasted. Just the way it looks. Other than that. Healthiest restaurants I'd rate numero uno!
Extremely disappointed. Enough said.
"Molly is a hair genius! :-) I am Ecstatic about my cut and color! The whole staff is friendly and upbeat.  The entire experience is brilliant!  Molly did an amazing consult, had tons of ideas and options, and took the time to explain everything she did and everything she was using.  The Wash House experience is also amazing!  Love love love it all! Can't wait to go back!"
"I usually go here with coworkers every Wednesday (Wingsday) night after work. It is endless wings on Wednesday so you really can't get a better deal. I enjoy going and eating here because they have tons of T.V.'s playing and you can usually catch whatever game you want and ask a server to change a channel for you if you don't have the specific game you want to watch on. The food is good and fairly priced and you are also paying for the experience of eating at a Hooters. If you don't know what I'm talking about when I say \""experience\"" then you have clearly never been to a Hooters. The servers have always been really nice and easy on the eye's, so to speak. I have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Definitely recommended."
Worst manicure I've ever had. I created a Yelp account just to provide this feedback.
Almost five stars! The sushi special not good!! It's not fresh and very simple taste... Everything else delish :)
"Okay, so maybe the styrofoam coming off the building sometimes was weird or the tapping from the construction, but this place is great.\n\nI've stayed at timeshares before, so it wasn't a surprise that we didn't have someone picking up our crap every morning.  The unit was big, comfortable, and a welcome home for our 6 day trip.  I agree with Lorraine that the washer/dryer was rude though, making us wait until it felt ready to open up.  The trick with the towels is the pool.  While they give you only enough for what seems like 2 people when you check-in, there is a never ending supply for pool guests.  A few here, a few there, and before you know it, we had about 100 towels left for housekeeping when we checked out.\n\nEveryone who worked there was helpful and accommodating, especially our new friend Gauge, the valet guy, who was always around at 4am to say hi; except for the head of security who wouldn't give my sick friend a key to our room even after talking to me on the phone.\n\nThe pool left a bit to be desired in terms of size, but with the hot tub and bar right there, we quickly got over it (damn you Vegas and you're law against deep pools).\n\nAll-in-all the location was awesome, the rooms were clean and new, and having a kitchen for your group when you get home late is a whole new experience.  I'd definitely stay again."
"WTH was I thinking when I decided to go back to LOS? I must be a glutton for punishment or something. After reading the recent comments in the Yelp Talk section about LOS being the Best Thai food in America, I decided to give them another try. I can't blame this mistake on caffeine deficiency, this time the mistake comes down to stupidity on my part for going back to a place that sucked the first time. LOS failed badly. Let's break down my descent into Thai hell that just happened. \n\n1: If there's a line of people waiting to get in good luck getting out. The way the narrow front entrance is setup is a safety hazard at best, a code violation at worst.  \n2: Wait staff can't even figure out how to open a bottle of wine. Saw that first hand 6 feet from me. Perhaps staff members should go watch YouTube and learn how to open a bottle without making it look like a broadway production to do so. For a place that milks that wine list hard, having staff that knows how to open the bottles is to be expected. What I saw was...well I started to wonder what he really wanted to do with the bottle from all the contortions he was going through to open it. \n3: 19 minutes from time of order until my plate arrived? Komol makes the same plate in exactly 1/2 the time. Yes I timed it. I ordered like for like and compared times. \n4: Portion size? Komol offers you more food at less cost. Seriously. I left hungry. At Komol I don't. \n5: Service. Is it too much to ask to get soy sauce? Good luck getting anyone's attention to get it, much less give you your check. \n6: That vaunted 50 page wine list of theirs is double and triple spaced, and frankly it ain't all that. I looked. Trust me I needed something to do while waiting on my food. \n7: Speaking of cost, I can order Chili Mint Chicken with an egg roll, ginger salad, and Thai Iced Tea and even with leaving a 25% tip at Komol it was still half the cost of LOS's Chili Mint Chicken, egg roll and Thai iced tea. I chose a simple dish so that I could compare them fairly. \n8: Speaking of Thai iced tea, it wasn't made properly and didn't taste as good as stuff I've had in LA and elsewhere here in Vegas.\n\n\nAnyone that thinks LOS is the Best Thai Food in America is downright delusional and really needs to get out and explore more. Komol kicks LOS's rear end. And they are light years away from the quality of food at Penn's Thai House. Best in Las Vegas? Yeah, not buying that claim either. I know this review may irritate a few diehard LOS defenders but if a place sucks, it just sucks. Call it as it is and be respected for speaking your mind vs. trying to prop up a place that doesn't deserve it. \n\n1 Star, under protest. \n\nMaybe I should get some Syrup of Ipecac as the food's not making my stomach happy either.\n\nEdit: 24 hours after I posted this LOS gets Yelp's Review of the Day? Wow. They don't deserve the recognition."
"I've had good meals and service here in the past on annual trips to Vegas, but not this time. Drinks sat empty waiting for refills, the server walked away without mixing the sauce for lettuce wraps and didn't return til we'd given up and attempted to mix our own. The salad was inedible, the meal wasn't much better. Undercooked rice, no flavor. No sign of our server for at least 15 minutes while we waited for our check. It was lunchtime on a weekday, not very busy. We went here as part of a long standing family tradition, but won't waste another Vegas meal \""time slot\"" on this place. Try Kung Fu at the other end of town."
"I ordered the bite sized chicken pieces. There was a bone in the very first one I but into. It cut my gums up. I am very dissatisfied. Avoid this place,"
"It's very different than the usual Mexican restaurant. This is Jalisco style. Not Mexican American. Authentic. Portions are small and no melted cheese on the nacos or most dishes but Athentic crumbled mexican style white chees very mild flavored.  It was okay not bad but I don't forsee myself jonesing to return.  Margarita was a bit high and I don't think they use Tequilia and I didn't see a bar. I think they may use white wine, which isn't unheard of in small family owned places in Mexico."
"The words \""epic fail\"" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.\n\nWe went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.\n\nThe food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*\n\nBy 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.\n\nInstead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.\n\nBar Louie:  You are dead to me."
"I've been a frequent patron of the Great Dane for over a decade, and there is good reason.  First, the beer is brewed on location and they have an amazing menu.  Add in the fun ambience and accommodating wait staff and you have a great restaurant.  \n\nIf you're in Madison long enough, you'll hear people mention Crop Circle Wheat more than a few times.  It's the best beer the Dane brews.  All the other beers are good too.  You can do a beer sampler if you want to find some other favorites. \n\nThere aren't many places that can say they have awesome meatloaf, ravioli, nachos and burgers.  Somehow, the Dane can straddle all of these different flavors and do them extremely well.  That's part of why I have come here so often; no matter what the people in your group want, they can get it here.\n\nYou can have many different types of experiences at the Dane based on where you are seated.  The front bar area is super fun and chill if you want to shoot pool, darts, play the jukebox or just watch sports.  The dining area on the top floor is casual and great for groups.  In the basement, you take your own tour of the Dane brewing process, which is fun in itself.  Eating dinner in the basement is more intimate, as its a bit darker with the stone walls.  The best place to eat though is the back beer patio.  On a sunny day or a cool night, its a fun experience that makes the Dane feel like a fancy restaurant without having to pay for it.\n\nStaff is awesome.  Just tell them what you want, they'll help you out.  We used to rent out the Dane for large group events, and they were always helpful.  \n\nThe Great Dane is an essential Madison experience."
"Well, this is truly a yawner.  The show does have some great acrobats, but the story is hard to follow.  The moving stage gets old quickly.  Totally not worth the high ticket price.  I was disappointed."
"If you are Las Vegas bound and want too see the Grand Canyon the best way to go is by Helicopter with my peeps Maverick Helicopters!!! Stamp by \""MrVegasVip\"""
"I have tried just about every buffet on the strip and this one is my personal favorite. However, depending on your tastes, you might like others better. I am crazy about quality seafood, sushi, salad, and crab legs.  Its the only buffet on the strip that offers sashimi poke, and steak tartar at less than $50. \nHowever, if you don't do sushi and prefer comfort foods with a different twist, this might not be the place for you. You can also find better deserts elsewhere.\nThat being said, I still feel that Bellagio has the best food at the best value in Vegas."
The pizza is pretty tasty.  Solid thin crust italian style pie.  If i'm nitpicking they are pretty stingy on the toppings and I wish they were a dollar or two cheaper.\n\nBiggest complaint here is the building itself.  If you get stuck inside one of those tiny little rooms that were built originally as someone's bedroom with like 7 tables be prepared to hear everyone's conversation but your own.\n\nAsk for the crushed red pepper infused olive oil - it is glorious. Dump the crushed red pepper on that spicy sausage.  Heat lovers dream.
This place is shit the workers lie about transfer fees and when they find out you dont have an AR or Glock they are dicks.
"READ MY WORDS PEOPLE:\nDO NOT GET YOUR VEHICLE WORKED ON IN ANY WAY AT THIS LOCATION!\nThey had my vehicle in  for a simple oil change and an hour later it was torn apart with no end in sight. I had to take the unbolted pieces  home myself and reinstall them.\nThey moved slower than slow and  between 6 of them.....they were all on breaks at one time. I actually had to rescue my vehicle from them!\nAs an ex- mechanic of twenty years, i have a keen sense of  clueless repair people and this was a graduating class. Stocking shelves....fine but trusting them with your vehicle is a no go. I have dealt with knowledgeable techs at other locations but this location really needs an overhaul. Steer clear and hopefully someone who cares in the management dept there will see this!!\nRuined my whole day !"
Lots of hands on stuff to do and explore. My faves - the robots - they never miss shooting baskets and will kick your ass at air hockey. Fun and informative way to kill an afternoon.
"How the Mighty have fallen , service is pure crap"
"I picked this restaurant specifically for two reasons. One is because I felt this would be a \""people pleaser\"" in terms of a solid steakhouse for a larger group. The other because it was a three dollar sign joint. I realize steakhouses can get pricey, so I wanted to find something that wasn't going to break the bank, but still be \""fine dinning.\"" \n\nThe service is very good, I'll note right away. But please be wary, our server was a totally up-seller. She knew exactly what she was doing.... \""oh, if you're going to get a couple glasses of wine, get a bottle\"" or \""what appetizers can I start you with\"" almost as soon as we sat down. I kinda feel like they're probably all trained that way. Not necessarily annoying, but be wary!\n\nAlso, the food is all a la carte. So you'll get up there in price with what you order. We had a table of 8 and ordered 4 different sides and they were all gone by the end of dinner. But it was the perfect amount. The good: garlic roasted spinach, the lyonnaise, and my fave grilled tomatoes (wonderfully red tomatoes with pesto and melted mozzarella on top aka YUM!). The okay: broccolini. \n\nI ordered a special, which was Filet Mignon with crab on top. I really wanted both the filet and crab, and the regular menu listed large pieces of both for much more. This was the perfect amount for $36. Plus asparagus! It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and very flavorful. The crab was fantastic and I almost wished there was more. Maybe a bit more, but the portion was good still. \n\nBest part is they brought the birthday boy, my dad, a free brownie sundae! All in all, a really excellent meal. Ended up being perfect for what I was looking for!"
"Are you willing to jump off of a building 855 feet off the ground? I did. \n\nAnd it was fun! I did at night, so the view was spectacular. The ocean of neon spread out below, the wind in your face, the brief feeling of weightlessness- all quite fun and well worth doing. As others have said, the hardest part is actually pushing yourself forward over the edge. Once you begin \""free-fall\"", you're really zip-lining almost vertically along the base of the tower. The speed is slightly less than I had imagined, so I was a little disappointed. Still, it's quite an experience. It feels a bit safer than skydiving and it's FUN! The deceleration was a bit rough. \n\nI do think that at $100 it's a bit expensive- for about $115 you get a photo booklet and a dvd of your jump. It's worth the extra $15, because it's so entertaining to watch yourself falling. It's not a face-shot, but you see your entire body and the city behind you as you fall, so it's still pretty cool. I prefer it this way, actually, because I don't have to see what kind of horrid faces I was making the entire way. \n\nBesides, there's a 76 year old woman who's done the jump 8+ times. Are you REALLY going to be outdone by her? ;}"
"Had my fiance's bday here with a party of 22 people. Service was quick and easy. Food menu was fine, we didn't care much. But happy hour menu had great deals. What we liked best about it was there were TV screens, everywhere. We didn't miss a moment of the games we wanted to watch. big plus. Also it was Friday night and the place wasn't that packed, so it was laid back and everyone was able to talk and just chilled the night away."
"I purchased the groupon $15 for $30 while my fiance and I were driving to Las Vegas for the weekend, I was so excited to try something new and visit that end of the strip. \n\nFirst off, let me start by stating that we were staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel and to get to the restaurant which is in the Treasure Island hotel took an hour to get to. That put us into ultra hunger mode when we finally got there. We read some ot the other reviews and were a little aprehensive about going, but since I had the groupon I was going anyways. We were seated right away, the lighting is very romantic and the decor is gorgeous. The waiter came over very quickly and brought us chips and salsa I ordered the guacamole, carne asada tacos and my fiance ordered the shredded barbacoa enchiladas. After I ordered I told them I had a groupon, all of a sudden their quick and efficientness turned into a slow crawl. Our waiter brought over our guacamole and let me tell you that is really good! I would go there again for chips, salsa, and guacamole, the rest of the food wasn't too good. My carne asada tacos looked like they were cooked in a pan with oil and was chopped up into small bites, nothing like what is pictured! not to mention there was fat still on the meat. The oil was dripping out of the tacos and there was no seasoning to the meat. The beans tasted like they were from a can, the rice was okay and as for my fiance his enchiladas wasn't barbacoa it was a shredded beef, barbacoa is PORK! He wasn't too happy with his food either, you should also keep in mind that my fiance is Hispanic and we eat authentic Mexican food at least once a week, and even I know how to make real refried beans so we are extremely harsh critics when it comes to mexican food. \n\nWe wouldn't eat this place again, such a shame cause we want to try new places out when we go to Vegas. I love the fact that I used a groupon with this place, had we gone without one I would have been very upset. If you have ever had good mexican food before, avoid this place as you will be very disappointed, if you are from a place that never serves mexican food then you will probably like it."
"We were staying at the Wynn and were lured in by the atmosphere. We had requested a table on the patio with a view of the lake and this was honored. It is quite amazing that the las Vegas strip is beyond the waterfall and the foliage. The outdoor seating has a serene environment & puts you in an environment that has little to do with Vegas or the casino the restaurant is attached to. Although all this is erased every 30 minutes with the \""lake of dreams show.\"" Which while entertaining can be quite bizarre.\n\nWe had the tuna ceviche, which was more like a fresh guacamole with really good tuna in it. The tortilla chip strips were a nice textural element. For our entree we shared the chile rubbed 42oz bone in ribeye for two. The steak was spicy and smoky with a nice charr. It was accompanied by char grilled onions and halape\u00f1os. We had the lobster Mac and cheese for a side which was tasty yet nothing special.\n\nThis is a traditional steak house with a non traditional atmosphere. It definitely makes for a nice night out in Vegas. I do recommend reservations as the restaurant was packed on a wednesday night."
"LOVE! Great staff, cool vibe, good lookin cats and probably had the best Vegas DJ spinnin the night I went. DJ Casanova! \n\nWe had a table on the rooftop and were taken care of very well. Security guards were very nice and the waitress was cute. I'll be coming back here every time I come to Vegas :)"
"Our waitress would disappear randomly from time to time. Ordered the fried pickles and they were so salty no one in my group could eat them. Told the waitress about it and her response was \""Yeah, we get that complaint all the time\"". She took it off our bill, but the food being so horrible and the bad waitressing our experience was pretty bad.  Not to mention the quesadilla's were not edible. Pizza was mediocre at best. If you go there, go for the beer only!"
Best collard greens I've ever had with BBQ to match. $3 pints of ANY BEER on Mondays. Super friendly wait staff. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in the area.
"My only complaint about the Great Dane Brewing company is that it made me miss my college days. \nThis is a wonderful little eatery that has nice, laid back vibe to it. Our server was wonderful and made sure that our beer glasses were full. \nThere is a beautiful outdoor seating area in the back and a beautifully decoded indoor area. \nWe had the boneless wing appetizer. The portions were generous and the sauce (while not hot) was quite tasty. \nThe burger that I had was juicy and delicious. The next time we are in Madison, we will be sure to stop back in."
"I've been a member at Planet Fitness since April and I love it. It's small so you see the same people there everytime you go if you have a consistent schedule, and there are very few meatheads grunting and trying to impress everyone with how much they can lift. The staff is super friendly and always willing to help people out by showing them how to use a specific machine...although I'm not sure why people need a tutorial on how to use an elliptical or treadmill, but that is just me.\n\nI pay $15/month and it is automatically debited from my account mid-month. There is nothing fancy about this gym...just cardio machines with a box that you can plug your headphones into so you can get the sound from whichever TV you select, free weights, and weight machines. No pool, sauna, classes, etc. It's just a gym which is all I need and want.\n\nEven when it's \""crowded\"", there is never a wait for machines or cardio equipment. Weekend mornings are pretty quiet, as are the days near the holidays. I've also noticed it's less crowded when ASU is not in session. All and all, a great place to workout especially since it within walking distance of my apartment."
"I had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree. Great flavors, although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini. The rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab. \n\nDefinitely heading here again to try more. :)"
"I personally appreciated and loved the medical staff at  Gateway when my 11 year old sister had to utilize the E.R. a couple weeks ago. They were detailed oriented, and very attentive to her needs and ensured she was comfortable and well taken care of while being tended to.\n\nThe rooms were very nice, and the E.R. wasn't a mess like many of my previous experiences to other hospitals E.R.'s.\n\nWhile we were there we made a visit to the Cafe. I've gotta say their food wasn't too bad. The pizza was great and they had a Starbucks to feed my caffeine fix. Take note tho, the vending machines are more expensive than the cafe, so take the few extra steps over there and grab your beverage."
this used to be my FAVORITE buffet a couple years ago. This buffet was supposed to be one of the highlights of my trip and it turned out to be okay. I wish i had spent my time eating somewhere else. Things that changed from the last time i was here:\n\n-less variety both desserts and regular food\n-desserts were bland minus the creme brulee \n-no rack of lamb (i was told its only on friday and saturday)\n-no ceviche \n\noverall this felt like it was work $20/pp not $40
"Had a craving for Chinese the other day while I was in Shadyside and wandered into China Palace.  How this place can stay in business in an area that I consider to be more sophisticated is a real mystery.  It was just awful and the service was terrible.\n\nI wanted to have the assorted appetizer platter, but asked if I could substitute one of the items with dumplings.  Our waiter had to ask the manager.  After much whispering, the manager came back to me and told me that I could have dumplings...then I asked if I could get the fried dumplings with that instead of steamed.   Well I was met with an outraged \""NO\""!!!!  It kind of surprised me that I got this kind of reaction.  I was told that the chef would have to fry 2 dumplings just for my platter.  I looked around and there were only 2 other people in the entire restaurant.  Isn't that what they're supposed to do?  Cook food for people to eat?  I would have never asked if I thought it would be such a big deal.  \n\nAnyway, the food was not very good.  In fact, it was awful.  \n\nWere they having an off day?   I'm not sure they were.   There's never any reason to be rude to your patrons.  No need to ever return."
"Main Street Station is old Las Vegas, on the older North Strip, closer to downtown than the newer South Strip, closer to the airport.\n\nThis area of Las Vegas is like Reno. A little grungier (because the courthouse and jail are nearby), but unpretentious, with a lot of older regulars, and Hawaiians flown in from the Islands at Main Street, or the Califronia Hotel. The Main Street Station Casino is like an old western train station, with dark hardwoods and antique stylings. There is even an old Pullman Rail car museum for the public. But the people are friendly and don't always have their hand out waiting for a tip like other glitzier South Strip hotels.\n\nThe 777 Brew Pub is an open room with TVs and tables that you might find in a mid size town in the west. It is lively and has a comfortable, casual feel. Now believe it or not, they serve sushi here! Yes, and they have a sushi chef in one corner making it for all to see. \n\nThe food and  beverages are decent, the prices are reasonable, and the place is nice for relaxation. If you want to be \""seen\"" this is not the place for you. If you want to enjoy company with reasonable food and drink in a relaxed atmosphere, then drop by."
"A great place to get out of the ordinary Chinese food.  This place can get really busy on weekend nights, so if you don't want to get upset about service don't go on a busy night, but if you have patience by all means.  It is after all a family owned and operated restaurant with all it's quirks. I personally have not been disappointed yet....\n\nMy favorites...chow fun, duck dishes and whatever fresh Chinese greens or vegetables they have available that day.  Seafood dishes are great too, especially clams with black beans...."
"Holy crap does this place not have ANY customer service in their DNA.\n\nAs the retail customer and the person that ultimately keeps them in business, you'd think they'd be a little warmer, more helpful and willing to work with you. They are not. In fact my wife and I found them snobby, condescending and not at all helpful.\n\nDuring the remodel process, we had to go to the slab yard a few times, each time felt like we were an inconvenience to them. \n\nThe final trip to Arizona Tile came a week before fabrication. Our fabricator Diamond Granite (see their AWESOME review on Yelp, went to confirm our slab was there. He asked them to pull it for us so that we could see it at 1:30PM as we had a very limited window of time to view the slab before picking up kids at school. When we arrived, they were once again too busy for us and had us take a seat. When we got to talk to someone they were unaware of our slab and asked who had our paperwork? How are we supposed to know? We were told they never pull a slab until a customer arrives and we'd have to wait for a large truckload that was now being offloaded. \n\nWe told them we had to be out at 2PM. It was now 1:45. At 2PM, we were told to be patient. At 2:15PM someone went out to see if the slab was there. It wasn't until 2:20PM a full 50 minutes after we arrived, that we had minutes to confirm our slab choice.\n\nI couldn't wait to get out of there. My wife and I hated the experience of working with Arizona Tile. The other company we looked at was Bedrosian's and the experience there was night and day different.\n\nOur recommendation: Go to Bedrosian's first for great customer service. If they don't have what you want, be prepared to get crappy customer service in exchange for the larger selection."
"Tryst truly takes the lead at the top of the list as the sexiest nightclub that I've ever been to.\n\nCostly as it may be, you cannot count your coins spent against Tryst.  Beautiful girls coupled by beautiful surroundings and swimming pools capable of musing the most cautious of conservative to take a chance and take the plunge."
Really good and spicy Thai food. Definitely recommend the Kung Pao.
"I'm really surprised at all the good reviews of this place. We have been trying to find a good Indian place in the area and chose here because of the good reviews. The bottom line is that all of the food was extremely bland. We got the vegetable samosa,  shrimp vindaloo, Bangan Bhartha, and garlic naan. The vegetable samosa's crust was very hard and didn't flake off like I'm used to, the filling was average (this was the best tasting thing we got). The shrimp vindaloo was in a very watery bland sauce that reminded me of italian tomato sauce. The Bangan Bhartha was just unbelievably bland. The atmosphere of the place was not bad and the service was pretty good. I didn't even want to keep eating after the first couple of bites."
"Gourmet hot dogs are where it's at. Station Street Hot Dogs takes the crown when it comes to Pittsburgh gourmet hot dogs, and so if you enjoy putting tasty things on other tasty things, this is the place for you. If you don't like hot dogs, or are a vegetarian, they also have tacos. So, really, you don't have a reason to not eat here. Station Street Hot Dogs is open until November 22 with limited hours--11 AM to 2:30 PM. Do yourself a favor and go get a bite.\n\nI have a weird habit of saving my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants for review only after I find out that they're closing (see: Embury, Fukuda; or the reviews I never wrote for T-Rav's BBQ Lab). Rick Sebak likes to talk about Things That Aren't There Anymore, and so in true Rick Sebak fashion, hopefully one day we'll be able to reminisce about the wonderful food when we sit in Pittsburgh circles and talk about Stuff That's Gone; in the big list of our favorites, Station Street Hot Dogs is sure to be there.\n\nFantastic hot dogs, crispy fries, delicious tacos (corn or flour tortilla, hon), and awesome rotating menu of rice-balls, mustard-grilled hamburgers, and reubens (just to name a few).\n\nThe other day I walked in with a friend or two and ordered my final meal--one of each of their gourmet hot dogs, a nice big order of poutine fries, and a Mexican Coca Cola. I call it a Dog Show. Luckily, they're closing, because I never want to look at a hot dog again."
"Ok so I read the other reviews about the carne asada and the california burrito.  I recently got back from San Diego (I know how you SD people are all about your mexican food) and had enjoyed my first \""California Burrito\""! the one I got there had french fries in it.  So I just rolled over to Polibertos.  Theirs has potatoes they did however sub the potatoes for fries and it was a good burrito. The burrito was 4.50!  So even though they don't make it with french fries and they are close to the house and I can get one for under 5 bucks. 4 stars and I'll be back."
"This place lost everything because of \""Kim\"" working the register. Lose the attitude - smile or go home. There are places where the food - or tea in this case is mediocre but the service and staff are friendly - so you return. Neither were great! There are many choices out there - go try em!"
"Hey guys I am a manager for Discount Tire. I had my car serviced at Gil's ,there isn't a more honest friendly place to go to for all your auto needs.Ask for Gil or Jameson. I'm glad I found a place with honesty and integrity. It is far a few these days.Give them try you won't regret it."
"Absolutely the worst meal ever. Catfish was old fishy and the wait staff\"" we've had a lot of complaints. It must really be bad\"" wth . .burnt ends were crap too. Not fresh at all."
"I'll start from the beginning as I typically do when reviewing a restaurant. We arrived Ruth Chris' a bit early for our 5 pm reservation- though the restaurant was still just opening for the dinner shift, Tashira, the hostess, welcomed my party and I with a warm hello and sat us at the bar while we waited on our table. Erin and Patrick the bartenders were friendly and equally entertaining while creating good conversation and our beverages. Chris and Ashley, the managers on site greeted us while enjoying cocktails at the bar- both with humble greetings and endearment. It was not long before Jessica, another employee, graciously assisted us to our table. Laura Beth our server first introduced herself before engaging us with the daily specials being served that evening. I first noticed her exceptional professionalism, it was rather busy that night and for anyone with knowledge of the foodservice industry, understanding that keeping your cool while doing 300 covers in a fine dining establishment is no easy feat.  After taking our drink order we informed Laura Beth of our plans to attend a concert that began at 7pm sharp, so a sense of urgency was necessary. Z, the servers assistant came at once with bread service, he was kind.  When Laura Beth returned My guest ordered a salad, Petite Filet with BBQ Crab medium rare and Green Beans, and I the Ribeye with Au Poivre sauce medium rare with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and the Potato au Gratin. \nBesides the salad of cool vine-ripen tomatoes and mozzarella, the food arrived hot. Let me say again, the food arrived hot! Everything the way I requested and the chef intended. Proteins cooked to the liking of my guest and as requested, seasoned beautifully, the crab- masterfully prepared by the kitchen staff. My au poivre sauce comparative of French bistros. Green beans crisp and delightful; the gratin, luscious, sexy, cheesy goodness. The wine- perfect. Laura Beth arrived once more to find our drinks full and mouths full, courteously smiling back at me knowing my guest and I were doing just fine. Evening though we were in quite the hurry the team at Ruth Chris did a marvelous job keeping my guest and I thoroughly happy as we dined. I happily advise anyone in or traveling to the area to keep Ruth Chris in mind when seeking dinner and a quite night out with a loved one, cocktails and conversation with business associates in the incredible bar, or even a quick lunch on the outdoor patio with views of Tyron Street and the inhabitants going on with their busy city lives."
"Maybe I missed something. I kept waiting for something to happen but it just never did. \nAll of these other reviews really express the visual details of the food here. So I won't re-hash all that. Well, maybe a few.\nThe restaurant space is very 90's. The red color, mirrors, unique all encompassing egg theme. Pink salt blocks everywhere. I just didn't get it. I understand the whole salt block culinary experience thing. But stacked up as a wall at the kitchen entrance? Not for me. The service? Super strange. The sommelier was like a game show host. Now I can appreciate that this job can lend to that sort of personality. But it was obnoxious. We saw more of him than we did our server. And again, I think she meant well.....but she came off as wanting to interact with us as little as possible. But she's the server?! We asked for recommendations and her opinions and she had none. No information to give us. A really strange experience.\nSo its not cheap, right. And I knew I was in for a culinary experience from what I know of Mr. Burke whom I greatly admire. But the lobster risotto was terrible. Really. And I hate to say things like this is a review. But it must be said because it's very expensive. The dish was so complicated and over-wrought and the lobster was over cooked. The dish wasn't particularly pretty either. I love lobster risotto and order it frequently elsewhere and it has been gorgeous to just stare at. Not here. My dining companions' filet was fine, not great but fine. We ordered the bacon fries and fish n' chips to start......both were excellent. I would go back and sit at the bar with both apps and a few drinks. And the drinks...... I order Makers Mark Manhattans on the rocks wherever I go. At David Burke.......it was a dud. Weak and watery, neon red cherry out of the jar. Not classy. Step it up.\nSo there it is, my not so nice review. I won't be back except for maybe sitting at the bar with the aforementioned apps and a glass of wine. Spent way too much money and was not happy. Sorry David."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I cannot believe that it only has 3 stars at this point in time. When my girlfriends and I were in Vegas in August, we went to this place 3 times within the week period we were there. \n\nThe atmosphere is whimsical, cute and fun! The food was delicious....in fact, the best food I had in Vegas (even compared to many of the pricey restaurants). The service was also the best I had in Vegas.\n\nEverything here is delicious, from the entrees to the amazing desserts. While there, I had the Caesar Salad, and tried some of my friends' sandwiches and steak. All of the entrees were AMAZING! The Double Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is delish, and so refreshing on a hot day in Vegas! I also loved every single sundae we had.\n\nThis place is all around, THE BEST place in Vegas for atmosphere, service, and food! Check it out and enjoy the great views and wonderful food!"
Very delicious food here
"We went on a Thursday night, which happened to be open mike night.  It was packed!  We barely found a spot at the bar.  The place itself is quite large with lots of different 'areas' to hang out in.  The open mike night was a lot of fun and I'm glad we happened upon it.  Even our bartender got up to sing and he was awesome... probably the most talented of all the brave souls playing that night!\n\nDrinks are really quite cheap and it wasn't even happy hour time.  Also every time a fire truck goes by (its adjacent to the fire department) drinks are $1 for fifteen minutes!  Pretty cool and appropriate special that they have enacted! The wings were actually quite good... at least crispy and not completely lathered in sauce.  \n\nDefinitely more of a dive bar with random posters etc all over the walls and no frills to speak of but its also not that ghetto or intimidating.  It definitely suites a younger crowd and has bands playing there regularly.  \n\nOverall a really nice and necessary alternative to Mill Ave.... Tempe needs more bars like this!"
"I hate to say it, slider, fans, but fuku stole my heart.\n\nNot only are their burgers really damn good, but GRAVY FRIES--just like home--are fantabulous!  I'm totally about their fuku sauce that they put on the gravy fries AND with their regular fries.  Mind you, their \""regular\"" fries have this serious seasoning that's salty, spicy, and sweet.  Yum-o!\n\nI tried their namesake burger and love it.  The meat is seasoned, which is a huge plus since others tend to forget to season the meat, not just sprinkle seasoning on it while it's grilling.  I also love the fact that their burgers are juicy every single time.  \n\nThe best part is TIP JELLY!!!!  I love those little things.  It's the great catches like tip jelly and their awesome customer service and entertainment that, with their great food, make this truck the only truck you'll want to find nightly.\n\nWant a great burger in Vegas and avoid creating a huge hole in your wallet?  Check out fukuburger.com, find where they are tonight, and get your fuku on!"
"The food is good, but no better than any other Mexican restaurant. The prices are ridiculous! $3.50 for one taco. Probably won't be going here again, unless I win the lottery."
"I can tolerate bad food when there's great service, and I'll deal with awful service when there's amazing food.  But at Il Mulino, we paid $100/person for above-average food and below-average service.  You can do better in LV.\n\nFOOD: Il Mulino starts you off with some tasty complimentary appetizers.  The parmesan cheese was great.  The bruschetta was decent, but I've had better.  The mussels were not fresh, but they're free.\n\nNone of the main courses wowed me, and at the price, they definitely should have.  The osso bucco ($48) was tender but bland, and came with a saffron risotto that was dry and gloppy, not creamy and luxurious the way it should be.  The lobster ravioli ($40ish) was overly cheesy and tasted nothing like lobster.  The veal chop (not sure) was totally dry and tasteless, like an overcooked pork chop.  The capellini with truffles and pancetta ($30) was the best main course, but I couldn't taste any truffle at all, so there was nothing too special about it.\n\nSERVICE: Started great, ended pretty badly.  From the minute you sit down, servers swarm you and start throwing free food at you.  Awesome.  But our actual waiter was snide and inattentive.  When my mother asked him to repeat some of the specials, he scoffed, \""Really? Do I really have to do that again?\""  He forgot to bring out one of our dishes, which would have been forgivable had we been able to find him to tell him.  Instead, after taking our order, he disappeared for the rest of the meal.  We ended up grabbing a bus boy to get us our spinach.  Glasses went unfilled, plates uncollected.  I've had better service at Olive Garden."
"This is an odd and confounding review to write. This place has got solid five star reviews, so it looks like I'm going to be the odd man out here in the experience I had when I visited.\n\nMy girl and I are getting married soon, so the other day we decided to start yelping places to look for a suit. We found Men's Apparel Club shining like a beacon amongst the mostly scathing Men's Wearhouse reviews. It was a no brainer...an affordable and well reviewed local business...I had my mind made up and my credit card in the holster ready to buy if I found something decent.\n\nUpon walking in, we were promptly greeted by Barry and had a quick discussion regarding the style I was looking for. He quickly found a suit that was right down my alley and that I could easily see myself getting into. This is maybe where we got off on the wrong foot. As Barry was talking about the suit, my fiance got out her phone to show him a picture of her dress, just to get his opinion on if they would match or not. She was quickly given a 'sweetie...no pictures' warning, as Barry thought she was getting her phone out to take pictures. This is fine, I understand his reasoning behind this, but the experience went downhill at this point. \n\nWhat happened from here...I'm still confused about. I began to ask questions about the suit, as he allowed me to try the coat portion on and educated us on the ins and outs of buying a suit for a good ten minutes or so. I liked how the coat fit, and was definitely thinking I needed to try on the whole get up. That's when he hit us with this...I quote:\n\n\""I know I'm wasting my time with people like you. You're not gonna buy here, and I know that. You're gonna shop around and do what you do. That's okay. I don't mind helping you out. I really don't. You know why? You're young and you don't know any better. You gotta learn this stuff some way. I feel like it's my duty\"". \n\nThis statement didn't sit well with me right off the bat. There's nothing worse than being told what sort of person you are. Stereotyping/assuming to this level is something I've rarely experienced in a retail situation. I don't tolerate it in my personal life, and absolutely won't stand for it when I'm voluntarily looking to give someone my business. I let it slide and moved on.\n\nWe both at this point made a concerted effort to let him know that we were in fact very much considering buying a suit at his establishment. I even at one point said \""I haven't heard the best things about Men's Wearhouse and other similar places, so I'm absolutely interested in making the purchase here if we can find something\"". I tried to make several not so subtle hints, that I was in fact very much wanting and willing to make a purchase with him, but he wasn't hearing it for some reason or another. \n\nHe continued to almost 'anti-sell' us from this point out. It was extremely odd. It was like the opposite of being at a car dealership. We felt as if we couldn't try on suits or buy anything there even if we wanted to. He made multiple comments regarding shopping around at other places and continued to minimize our intention to buy. The odd thing was...he gave us all sorts of good advice regarding the ins and outs of buying a suit. However, at the same time he seemed unwilling and uninterested in selling us one personally! \n\nAfter about 25 minutes we finally decided it was time to go, as we really didn't feel very welcome. On the way out of the door I tried one more last ditch effort to let him know I was interested, it went like this:\n\n\""So, if I end up deciding on this suit would I be able to come back in early October to get everything going?\""\n\nBarry - \""October...I may not be around. You'll probably have to go elsewhere\"". \n\nThis was the story of our trip to Men's Apparel Club...the underlying feeling that our business wasn't wanted. I'm really not sure why or how this happened, some possibilities come to mind:\n\n-Communication style differences causing some sort of misunderstanding.\n-The phone issue getting the idea in his head that we had no intention of buying.\n-Us being young and Barry not taking us seriously.\n-Barry possibly having previous bad experiences with shoppers like us, leading to an unfair stereotype.\n-Some other issue I haven't thought of or didn't realize.\n\nIt's too bad we had this experience, because the truth is. This place has the best prices in town by far.\n\nMy suit at Men's Apparel Club - less than $250\nMy suit at Men's Wearhouse - $600\n\nSo in the end, I don't doubt that this is a great place to buy a suit for some people...it just wasn't for us based on our experience. Maybe I caught Barry on an off day, I'm not sure. Maybe Barry doesn't even realize the bad taste we left with. I'm now left in the odd position to thank Barry for all the great advice he gave me on buying a suit, then scratch my head and ask him why he didn't seem to want to sell me one."
"Definitely pub-like, in a cavernous sort of way. Good Strongbow on tap is a plus. Ordered the Confit Duck Legs on Whole Wheat with Black Truffle Mayo and Todd English BBQ sauce. Also had the New England Fish & Chips. Although definitely not \""pub\"" prices, very delicious and somewhat worth it. Lots of interesting foods on the menu to try. \n\nVery good food and fun place to hang out."
$9 for a sandwich only. It was not worth it.
Everything is delicious. You can't go wrong with the dolsot bibimbap and the galbi is extremely tender and flavorful. They give generous portions of the banchan sides and the people are very friendly and accommodating. I recommend if you're looking for good Korean food in the valley.
I always stop here when I come visit Vegas. Located near the casino and elevators at the Venetian.\n\nI looooove the shrimp scampi pasta (i think that's what it's called)\nLinguini noodles with GINORMOUS grilled and partially battered shrimp with a light white wine sauce and tomatoes.\n\nwe usually have to wait to be seated esp post club time... sometimes i get a little dizzy because of the floral smell -- i dont wanna smell flowers when I eat my shrimp!\n\n-1 for slippery floors!!! I always fear that I'll eat it real bad when I walk around here.\n\nYUM YUM YUM. \n\nYou get what you pay for and maybe a little bit more.
"There is always something different at Seconds 2 Go since they are getting new things in all the time.  They carry almost everything you would expect to find in a thrift store (furniture, handbags, household goods, shoes, etc.), but I think the biggest find here is the high-end designer women's clothing and shoes.  \n\nThe prices are comparable to the other thrift stores in the area and with three other thrift stores (Flo's on 7th, Children's Angel Foundation's Thrift Boutique and Halo) it makes it a must on the route of thrift stores.  \n\nI always find something when I go in here and I'm sure you will too."
I have gone to Tri for about 4 years now for my nails and love him and his staff. Everyone is so friendly and are good at what they do. He always makes an effort to fit me into his schedule even tho I am very last minute! He does a great job and genuinely cares if u are happy with your service. I have referred many friends to him and they all feel the same. Bottom line is u won't have a bad experience if u go to creative salon
"Aaron is awesome!!! I bought my house almost three years ago and unfortunately didn't have Aaron Lending do my mortgage, only because I didn't know him at the time, but Aaron has put me on his famous watch list as he has got all of my info and will call me when there is  a better rate out there for me. I wish I would of come across this originally, instead someone wanted to just put me in a home and a crappy mortgage, I know that wouldn't of happen with Aaron Lending."
"Best Reuben I've had for such a great price. It's flavorful and delicious. I would go back for the sandwich alone. The service however was complete sh*t. The guy at the register was an absolute A-hole and it took everything in me not to climb over the counter and choke him. But like I said... The sandwiches are worth it. \nMy gf had the ham, egg, cheese breakfast sandwich and she said it was one of the best she ever had as well. We may go back."
"If once a year you decide to take your friends up on their offer to go hiking next weekend, don't.\nI thought it would be fun. \nIt wasn't.\nI was sick at the first signpost...the one in the parking area.\nIt never got any better. \n\nMy lungs, inflated for the first time in years with something other than weed and cigar smoke, were seizing up like an old whore.\n\nMy legs so jittery from the experience, caused my car to lunge back and forth on the drive home, as my jimmy-leg worked both the gas and brake simultaneously.\n\nAnd my feet hurt so badly, I had to soak them in ice before going out that night.\n\nI'll be back up there next weekend."
Fish tacos were very nice. Had the bartender make an avocado margarita that I once had at a 5 star resort in Mexico and it was just as good if not better.
I ordered the Cajan style ribeye which is marinated for 36 hour and it was delicious. Good customer service and clean.
"I went here today. I have been going to Larrys for about 8 years. Not going back.\nI go about 4 times a year and stock up. Ran out of some items a couple months ago purchased a rack of ribs to slow cook in oven. Before they have cooked so tender no knife needed.  This past trip,  the counter person says, I have to open a new bag. Huh? Anyway, bought them,  cooked them the same as before but no joy. Too tough and fatty. I chalked it up to either a bad selection (which I didn't get to choose) or new supplier. Just told myself not get ribs there anymore.\nToday was looking at the ribeye steaks. They looked terrible. Looked like gristle running through center of the steak, and small and overly fatty - not neatly trimmed at all. Didn't get that,  got ground beef instead. When I got home, when I went to repackage for the freezer, it just didn't look right and texture seemed different. Will see when I cook it if it is different or not.\nAt register just because, I mentioned it looked different inside - did the place get new owners.  Turns out yes, new owners. I don't know that the new owners changed suppliers,  but I am guessing it is either that or buying a lower grade of meat.\nI hate to give a bad review of starting businesses,  but I go to a butchers expecting to pay higher prices for a higher quality product. I could have gotten the same or better at the regular grocery store from what I saw today.\nNever again."
"Every time we visit Vegas, my fiance and I make sure to see at least one show.  The last time we went, the show was Phantom.  I have to say that I wasn't impressed.\n\nThe story seemed really rushed with the content cut as it was.  The actors were almost impossible to understand when they were singing.  It wasn't their fault though - it seemed more like the sound system was not balanced quite right.\n\nI wouldn't take someone else to see it, and I wouldn't spend money to see it again."
We went for Aloha (happy hour) and the specialty cocktails for $5 were great as well as the calamari but the sliders were awful and the sushi rolls had no flavor. The place was pretty dead and they are obviously just hanging on... very sad to see when Flemings right next door is jam packed.  Better food and some personality behind the bar would work wonders. We would only return for the calamari and there is better elsewhere.
"I just wanted to say I have been being FORCED to eat at this place for about 9 years now as my stepfather loves it here. Is it the food you ask? No he loves spending a fortune. Our last dining experience was on Easter. Before that it was on Christmas. Now I come from a culinary family so 1. I am a disecter of foods. I know what it should taste like and how they should achieve such tastes. Their food is MEDIOCRE at best. The filet is decent however like all of their meats, FLAVORLESS. Their desserts have to be the WORST Desserts in the History of Mankind! The men who hover close to the tables to make sure you always have a clean table, a full glass and anything you need ..well they just mainly stand there talking about the guests and their lives.. I think they think no one can hear them but it isnt the case. Their sea bass although drowned.in a sauce was decent. Tender n flakey and it had a good flavor. Their Salates station is decent as well however for the food that sticks to your bones F- ... I told my mom n dad next time the family wants to eat let's not spend $800+ on yucky food from here instead I and my chef brother will cook for the whole family. Their food Especially the Buffet is not worth the money. If someone wants to take you here it is to show off about how much money they can spend and not about what they know about fine dining and food in general."
THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE EARLY EVENING DINNER TASTING MENU -- $39/PP\n\nAPPETIZER \n- lobster gazpacho | traditional chilled spanish soup with lobster meat\n(upon receiving this order .. I thought this was going to be a rich dense soup but it is really light and a nice chill taste. highly recommend this dish as an appetizer)\n\n- stuffed piquillo peppers | goat cheese | mushrooms \n(one of my favorite tapas menu item to order. Nice spice and the goat cheese was cooked to perfection)\n\n\nENTR\u00c9E \n- fish | fresh seasonal selection\n(fish for the day was a salmon. I usually rarely order something I can make myself at home but the fish was cooked perfectly. nice slice and seasoned well. paired with baby carrots and seasonal vegetables. I would opt for the other items available if possible but still a nice entree)\n\n- pork chop | sous vide pork chop | baby carrots | dry fruit | px demi\n(entree is HUGE! might take 3 people to finish this course. the dates and prunes were a great addition to the dish. sauce was amazingly flavorful. a definite try)\n\nDESSERT \n- molten chocolate cake | baked meringue | blood orange sorbet\n(best dessert available. blood orange sorbet was beautifully crafted. chocolate cake was so gorgeous)\n\n- santiago's cake | almond cake | turr\u00f3n ice cream | caramelized nuts \n(server recommended this cake over the the other option. Can't get Turron ice cream like this anywhere.\n\n\nOVERALL\nJulian Serrano is known for his work over at Picasso at the Bellagio. His tapas inspired restaurant at the Aria is bit more casual than his offering at the other hotel. I definitely will be returning to try his popular tapas items. Highly recommend this restaurant to all of my peers visiting in Vegas.
Buzzzzzzz in my room all night long coming from the vents. Creepy clicking speaker in the ceiling. Construction noises like a drill sting during the day. I can hear my neighbors talk. Avoid at all cost.
Prime rib special is a steal with soup or salad bar and great desert cherries jubilee is to die for
"So you saw all the pictures people posted right? Looks good right? Mmm U can taste it already in your mouth...the hot spicey tofu soup, the bulgogi lunch combo...mmmm\n\nI saw small little teeth marks on my kimchee that most likely was from a rat getting into the tub of kimchee in the back kitchen somewhere. These marks were not a half eaten kimchee cube from a human. I know what a half eaten kimchee cube looks like from a human. This was a pest.\n\nI spit my food out. Got up and left. Didn't even bother reracking the food tray.\n\nNever came back during my two year prison sentence in grad school."
"I went to this location for the first time and needless to say I will never be back! The food was disgusting and cold, and the service was unbelievably horrific! I waited 10 minutes for a refill and when the waitress came to our table, she took off my straw and lid herself, touching MY straw, put the dirty plates down on our table, and put my cup in her apron pouch where food was all crusted on. I couldn't believe what I saw. I was completely disgusted. That is no where near sanitary! I know it's just \""golden corral\"" but please get your service staff in check!"
"You're looking for a place off the strip that's more relaxing in casual, this is your place. Five dollar blackjack tables all day; dealers very friendly. Great food selections at a very reasonable price. And the bowling alley that beats everyone! The rooms are average at best but they are clean. The staff was a little lacking."
"This review is based strictly off their customer service.\n\nMy wife and I were going out for dinner last night at Muramoto.  We arrived early (5:30p) to the King Street area.  So, we thought we would stop by Nat Spil for a couple pre-dinner cocktails.  Neither of us had been there before and were excited to give it a try.\n\nOur initial take was we really liked the atmoshere - seemed very cool.  However, as mentioned in other reviews, we soon found that the place was small and a little confusing for us.  The place has about 10 tables that I could see and a small bar with about 12 stools.  Is it a restaurant or a bar?  The reason I bring this up is that when we walked in there were two couples sitting at tables and no one at the bar.  One couple had food and other couple just had cocktails.  There was no one to greet us when we walked in (i didn't think that was going to be a big deal but it obvioulsly was), so we sauntered over to the bar and ordered a cocktail.  After the drinks were poured we thought it might be more comfortable sitting at a table and told the bartendress - \""no problem\"" she says.\n\nWe chose a table in the front window area.  It was small but had four sets of silverware.  Suddenly a waiter appears and asks if it just the two of us tonight.  \""Yes\"" I replied.  He lets out a big sigh, and then snatches two of the silverware sets.  As he is walking to the cupboard to put them away I notice that he is shaking his head the whole time and is still visible pissed that there is only two of us.  He then takes the silverware he just cleared and started slamming/throwing  them back into the cupboard drawers.  \n\nLet me take the opportunity to remind you that there were four other customers in this establishment at this point and it was 5:30pm.  It's not like we were occupying prime seats during prime time.  \n\nSo... The waiter comes back and says, \""what do want for dinner?\""  with an exaggerated roll of his eyes.   I said we were just having drinks and wouldn't be staying long.  Another hugh sigh and he storms off to his station and takes a big drink from his wine glass.  I was surprised to see the waiter drinking at 5:30.  I wonder if he paid for that drink or if it was stolen from the establishment's owner?!?\n\nWell that pretty much sealed it - not going to have a second drink there.  We slammed our cocktails and high tailed it.  As we were leaving we had to walk right past him.  He never looked up or even acknowledged we were leaving.  \n\nInterestingly enough... Around 8:00p as we were walking back to our car from Muramoto, we glanced into the front window of Nat Spil.  It looked they had a whooping crowd of about 6 people.  I wonder how many other people left after dealing with that ass-bag waiter?!?"
"Punked!\nIn a sentence, horrendous value for money.\nWe chose this place expecting a fine dining experience complete with great food and service. Unfortunately both failed and especially the service.\nWe had specified to our waiter immediately that we had an hour and a half before we had to leave to attend a show and he assured us we'd have plenty of time to enjoy our meal at a quiet and relaxed pace.\nOne hour and 10 minutes later our steaks arrive even though the 2 parties next  to us arrived later and had already been served all 3 courses of their meals. What's going on?\nCall it favouritism, poor planning or whatever, we had to engulf our meals in 10 minutes before rushing off to our show only to be late. Not only that, the waiter forgot to include the mushrooms I ordered, had them made quickly and then added them to our bill...so considerate of him. Where's the common sense in customer service? At least give me the mushrooms for free!\nI wish I could say the food was superb but it was average at best;  I've had better steaks  at 1/10 the cost, no joke.\nBottom line: if you're looking for a premium dining experience, think twice before choosing Delmonico."
"This place doesn't even deserve one star!  It is absolutely disgusting!  Myself and my guest both got food poisoning from this place!  We went there on April 25, 2013.  Our sickness lasted for days!  Everything on the buffet was old, dried out and room temperature.  And omg....the bathrooms....wow!!!!  Absolutely disgusting!  The entire place was filthy.  I knew we should have walked out immediately!  Just from the smell inside the place.  Whatever you do.....remember....you are taking a very very big chance if you eat here!  I think it would be more likely than not....that you will end up sick!  We actually got staph food poisoning from here.  Otherwise known as \""Staphylococcus aureus bacterium\"".  I truly believe this place needs to be SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY!!!"
Great burgers and sandwiches. Had the pastrami burger with sweet potato fries this time. Service was good and it didn't take long for our food to come out.
"I adore this place! It is always packed and the service is wonderful. This is my 3rd visit in 2 months; the portions are huge, the options are endless and the waitstaff is knowledgeable. My only advice is not to order any of the steak menu items. The sirloin was fatty and just bad (one star subtraction). Everything else I have had from sushi to chicken to shrimp has been off the charts delicious and fresh. Grab a few friends, get the sushi boat and prepared to be blown away. A hidden gem that is in our regular rotation. CHECK IT OUT!!!"
"Nice hotel for young people bad experience, dealers were rude made sexual comments about my wife, the operator when i called wouldnt look up my reservation, the food at koi was a joke, Worst Hotel I have stayed in and I go to vegas a lot, dont waste your money"
"Little pizzieria tucked away in the village center trails shopping center. From what i can surmise it's all family-owned and run and serves Brooklyn style \""fold-over\"" pizza though i'm hardly an expert.  Picked up a large cheese to share which was promptly ready on time. Crust was on the thin side like i like it but hand tossed and just the right amount of sauce. And they didn't skimp on the cheese. Basic little italy decor, with red checkered tablecloths and a help yourself soda fountain. Currently, it's 13.25 for the lg cheese (a little steep to me) but check the valu-pak coupons and get it for 9.99.  Rest of the menu, regular fare, calzones, salads, and can order pizza by the slice.  By The Way, they offer free delivery to limited areas. P.S. To absolve you of your guilt, you can also get it made with whole wheat crust for a buck more."
"Amazing atmosphere, great service, fantastic drinks and really good food.   For someone to say this place is over priced is  completely ridiculous.....  If you are paying $8 for a water in the hotel gift shop, what do you expect to pay for an entree at one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas?  Expect to spend like $75 a person if you order a 3 course meal with drinks.  I highly recommend this to any group, party or couple visiting Las Vegas.  This is my 2nd time at TAO and I have not had a bad meal.  You wont be disappointed!"
"I Specifically asked for NO MEAT of any kind.  Even made inquires about the sauces and if they had chicken broth, etc.  When I got home we found our rice had little bits of beef in it.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner.  Also the prices online were cheaper than what they charged in the store, not cool.  Certainly will not return to Quick Wok."
We love RPC!! We have been here for nine years and just love Pastor Bill's sermons and the worship here! Our son loves the Children's ministry and we are so happy to be a part of the RPC community!
"For Las Vegas, this is definitely \""as good as it gets\"".  I love anything related to theater: musicals, plays, ballets, operas, orchestras, etc. and I have been to my share of performances in LA, SF, and NY.  And I believe that The Smith Center holds its own.  It is still brand new and still surrounded by a lot of construction, but that construction just means potential for even more artistic excellence and inspiration.    \n\nI came for \""An evening with David Sedaris\"" in the Reynolds Hall, and even Mr. Sedaris called the venue \""lovely\"" and a refreshing change from the stuffy and baroque style theaters that he frequently performs at.  Personally, it was also nice to watch a show without having to walk through a smoke filled casino with sounds of slot machines ringing in my ears.  Even more nice to not have to navigate my way around scantily clad drunk college kids with a yardstick of alcohol around their necks.  \n\nI purchased tickets online and was very impressed to see the \""view from your seat\"" link, and after virtually sitting in almost every section, I decided to purchase tickets in the \""Right Dress Circle\"" on the 3rd level and I was very pleased with our view of the stage and the acoustics.  From the moment that we drove onto the lot to the moment we left, the staff was very professional, friendly, and eager to help. It seemed that there were more staff than necessary, but perhaps they wanted to ensure a very smooth and seamless experience- and that it was.   \n\nI have already purchased tickets for future performances and am looking forward to visiting the Cabaret Jazz venue as well.  I am pretty sure I will be a season ticket holder soon because The Smith Center is definitely a world class performing arts center that Las Vegans can be proud to call their own."
"Only ordered 4 items: apple pie, bbq Ranch Burger, small fries, and large Mocha frape. Still messed up my order. Made me wait because they ran out of Mocha mix. Gave me medium frap, no apple pie. Went inside told them I ordered large and the missing apple pie. They said there were no apple pies left. Made me wait more than 10 min. And incorrect order. Just left and disregarded the pie out of my frustration. So bad"
"Wendy's restaurants are usually excellent, in terms of food and service. This particular restaurant however lacks that quality in its service. I was shortchanged during my visit there. Figured that out later in the day and called for a refund of the difference or some kind of compensation. They said the tills had the right amount of money and that I should have said something while I was in the restaurant. Either the manager was lying or the girl at the register pocketed some of my change. The manager said she would call me back after speaking with the employee and never did.\n\nDon't take the risk; go to the In 'n' Out across the street. The Wendy's isn't as crowded for a reason, as I learned the hard way."
I couldn't be more frustrated with this facility.  We went here to avoid that big gym feel and this place is equal too or worse.  First don't get sucked in by the pool because the kids pool or slide is not open often enough or during times you could use.  The lap look is always booked or full so if you want to take the kids swimming this isn't the place.  They have a cool rock wall but no one is there to let you use it.  The kids area is not appropriately staffed and the check in process is very insecure. Say you decide you don't want to use the gym anymore?  Good luck canceling.  You jump through loops designed to stop you from canceling and still they misplace your file and harass you for the bill you canceled. At $92 a month you can get alot better.  Avoid at all cost because I'm still dealing with their billing mistakes.
"We thought our fridge was broken because it smelled really bad.  We had someone come up to look at it and they just said it'll stop smelling in a little because they turn it off between hotel guests or something? Totally incorrect way to run things at the hotel.  \n\nAlso, they charge for the gym facility? I mean maybe for people who aren't STAYING at the hotel but they charge everyone...very interesting.  \n\nA plus is that it IS near public transportation so that's cool if that's what you're looking for.  There are other places, in the same price range as this place, that are much better."
"If you look at my other reviews, you'll see I very rarely give a restaurant 1 bubble. And for local places in my community, I will often say nothing if I don't have anything nice to say. But this experience was so thoroughly terrible I'm making an exception. A friend visiting from out of state was thrilled we had a Hungry Howie's in our town as this was her favorite pizza chain back east. Since we had not had a chance to try it yet, we gave it a go. First we tried ordering on the web site but it does not allow you to select a flavor for the crust - that seemed odd considering how much they promote this and rely on it to differentiate themselves from all the other pizza joints in town. OK, so we tried calling our order in. We had seen the specials on the web site, but when we asked for it on the phone, a teenage-sounding guy told us they didn't have that promotion and it would cost roughly double the advertised price. At this point I started getting annoyed, but I kept calm and ordered on, after all, our friend loves this place, maybe the food will redeem it. Since we were already out and about, we declined delivery and went in to get it. Imagine my surprise when we saw the front of the building was plastered with large advertisements exactly matching what we saw online. There were also posters and stands inside the restaurant showing these same deals. Really?! How could this guy NOT know the specials they offer? Does he come in through the back door every day? Does he never look left when he answers the phone? I probably should have said something, but at this point it was worth the extra money to not prolong any interaction with this person. I paid and left. At home we realized they never offered us a choice of dipping sauces for the bread sticks and that the pizza did not have the flavored crust we ordered. The bread sticks were burnt and tough. We tried to eat a couple but ended up throwing them away, which if you know me is atypical - I will eat terrible food rather than waste it, but this was beyond edible. The pizza was cooked to perfection, but the cheap ingredients and \""canned\"" tasting sauce put it below average. Our friend assured us she has never had this experience at the other stores she has been to, that even the web site is better for other stores, and that we just have a bad one. Until this location brings its customer service and product quality up to the standards the chain apparently sets for its other locations, there is no chance we will be returning."
"After a year in Portland, Oregon we have found a single spot for decent BBQ, and it was much more expensive than Joe's for much less food. We will struggle on here in the Rose City (loving the city just not the lack of good BBQ) as we continue to pine away for Joe's..."
"This is by far one of the best hotels that I have stayed at. We stayed here during December and I don't know why it has taken me this long to review the hotel. \n\nHere's a lots if why I like this hotel compared to alllll the other hotel one can choose when visiting Las Vegas. \n\n1. Very nice elegant and modern architecture. Our room was very nice and decorated to perfection. Our view was priceless and the best part of it was that it was about 220 a night. Our stay was during middle of December. \n\n2. The location. It's centralized within the strip and it's a easy walk to the surrounding hotels, shops and  restaurants. There is also a tram that one can take to get around. We just walked everywhere because it was  so convenient. \n\n3. The restaurants. Specifically the Buffett. I used to think that Wynn had the best Buffett. But that is until I tried Aria buffet. I believe it was about $40 for dinner or $45 for dinner per person. But not was it worth every penny. The variety of food was endless and the quality was unbeatable. \n\nI loved everything about this hotel and I truly recommend it to anyone a traveling through Vegas. The off season prices make it affordable. So try it of you can because it's truly worth it."
Worst printing service I ever had. The employee raped my friend's bank accounts by misquoting them and giving them zero options. We are design students at asu and were very dissatisfied with the overall experience that was offered. I will never bring my business to this location or any other fedex office or junkie locations again.
"Crappy service. Good food..... Ordered, then got food 50mins Later then didn't see the Waitress for another 30 mins..... When she dropped off the check..."
"Visited last week and was very happy. It took a few minutes longer than expected but it was well worth the wait. WILL return, next time in town."
"Outback is better, cheaper, and way less Stuffy.  A restaurant should start to re-examine their quality if they can sit at the last minute on friday or saturday night.  The prices are ridiculous for the quality of the food.  If I pay $50 for a filet minion, I expect for it to knock my socks off.  It was underseasoned and the outer portions were actually dry on a medium cooked steak.  We paid $18 for the mac and cheese, recommended by other yelp reviews, and the mushrooms.  I don't understand how mushrooms could be so bland, and if it was. $25 steak dinner including the mac and cheese that would have been worth it.  The mac and cheese was the most interesting thing we got and it was slightly amusing at best.  Overpriced.... stay far far far far far away from this Stuffy restaurant.  Worst meal in vegas and most expensive."
"A buffet of average. Everything is okay, nothing is bad, but for bellagio you'd expect a little more. It's not expensive relative to other buffets but it's not cheap either. They seem to have conceded to being average, and they shouldn't have."
"I was fooled by the reviews. This was my first time ever going to a laundromat, and from the reviews, this placed seems like they would help me figure it out. \nWell,  I took my comforter in to wash today and the lady working was overly rude when I asked her questions. And if I didn't catch it the first time, she started speaking to me in a slow, degrading manner. She also told me I needed the biggest, $6 washer, which was probably actually a little excessive, but oh well. \nAlso, well over half of the machines are out of order. And the place isn't very clean for a laundry facility. \nMaybe I just didn't come when the right employees were working, but these other reviews had my expectations a lot higher than they should have been."
"Good food, nice prices and friendly people. The place is well staffed although they could do a bit of spring cleaning, my side of the booth was littered with napkins and what not. Surprisingly they have delicious roast beef sliders."
"Stopped by for some Nachos that I have been craving for a while and I had a few hours to burn in the airport.  Price was not bad compared to the other places in the C terminal.  Popeyes chicken was 10 bucks for a three piece meal so I my pulled pork nachos weren't that far off.  I ordered them and they came pretty quick.  The order was huge, with two types of salsa on the side.  If I ordered meatless Nachos I would say this is a 3 star meal, but the nachos came with about 2 tablespoons of pork.  I literally had to search my plate at first for any signs of meat.  Also, might be coincidence, but within 15 minutes of finishing and paying for meal I had to make an emergency run to the restroom.  One time shot, but it certainly did not agree with me.  Next time might try Popeyes!"
Wouldn't come back based on the fact they recommend their steaks and don't know how to cook them. They made both steaks at our table RAW. Insanely raw. They recooked one and it lost all flavor and was terrible; charcoal on the outside. The grouper was delicious but service was crap... They took away our bread without asking if we were done and it just felt rude. For the price we paid they could at least be courteous.
"Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no"
"Great hotel. The rooms are super clean, there's water in the fridge, and the gym is decent. My only critique is that you have to refresh the Internet connection every 24 hours (and must pay $10 bucks per device - iPhone included), the breakfast is not very good (unless you get it made to order), and they left my previous nights room service tray outside my door until the next afternoon. Besides that, everything else was fantastic. The location is convenient, service attentive, and overall experience pleasant."
Came here in the afternoon got super lucky and got 2 front row seats  in front of the wave pool !!!  drinks are (Duh! expensive ) @ $15 each \n\nLoved the sun and sand  !!!\n\n-1 star for having to pay for the tubes ( $25 ) for the lazy river.....
This place is great. The papusas are fantastic and so are the banana leaf tamales. We had the sampler platter once to try some different things and everything was great. Service can be a tad slow so don't be in a hurry and your patience will be rewarded. Different flavors from Central America. Yay!
Stayed at the Hard Rock the previous trip so Mr. Lucky's got some action from me. The first time I ordered the 777 special with is 8oz steak 3 shrimp and mash potatoes for $7.77.  It isn't on the menu so you'll have to ask for it.  It was way too salty but i ended up eating it anyways.\n\n2nd visit was at 6am after a drunken night. I ordered Chicken Fried Steak for around $15 and it was also overly salty.  It was ok but the salt was a bit too much for my taste buds.  \n\nService was fine the two visits but the food quality and price isn't attractive. I only eat here if im staying at Hard Rock but would rather get something else at another place.
"While vacationing in Vegas, we decided to come here for our last meal before making the 12 hour journey back home.\n\nIt was Christmas day, and Ihop was very very packed.. we waited for 20 mins to be seated. Ok, understandable. \n\nWhat was not understandable was we had to wait another 10 mins to even get greeted. Someone came to our table and said, \"" what would you guys like to drink?\"" \nWe politely answered \""water\"" and let him know we were ready to order. He said, \""Well I'm actually off work and just helping [insert name here]. She's the one that will be taking your order.\"" Okay, whatever.. \n\nAnother 5 minute wait, and [insert name here arrives]. She takes our order, and we're good.. or so I thought.\n\nChris points out that none of the tables in our section have their food. Red Flag.. we really should have left right there and then. They were here first and that meant they would get served first before us.\n\nNeedless to say, the guy that was off work already helped our server, thus making it a somewhat faster process. We did get free oj, compliments from our server, which was nice. Food was good. We quickly ate our food and headed back to our hotel room. Just in time for check-out. \n\nSince we did go during a busy period, I do not know if this is how slow it usually is. I did read other reviews, and apparently they are slow. Only suggestion/ tip I would give is, do not come here if you are on a time crunch. You will probably be late to your appointment"
"They make cupcakes now! Gluten free, soy free, vegan cupcakes. I asked Ginger \""If there's no wheat or soy, what the frak are they made of?\"" and she said \""Love.\"" And you know what, based on how delicious those cupcakes are, I believe they just might be."
"Probably one of the few fancy Japanese places I enjoyed ... ever.\n\nI thoroughly loved the decor (which resembled some evil superhero hideout, to be honest) and the presentation.  I opted for the chef's special with a bunch of nigiri and sashimi and was definitely impressed.  The waiter was a pretty cool guy all throughout the evening.\n\nI miss Shibuya already."
"Being generous considering we found two bugs. The beds are comfy,  staff is a little pushy on hotel promotions, not the cleanest but not the dirtiest."
"So my husband and I had a gift cert to go to the movies. We chose to see pacific rim, which was a great movie, you should go see it. However we got to our theater and chose our seats, we were the only ones there as well. We just figured cause it was monday afternoon so thats why is was not so busy. \n\nMy husband noticed a leak due to the rain storm and informed one of the staff. They did nothing. As the start time for the movie approached and passed and no previews started. He got up and went to ask why they didn't start the movie. They told him they moved it to another theater because of the leak. \n\nNot once did anyone come and tell us that information. Very rude. So as we walked to the other side of the theater, one of the employees handed us two free movie passes as a \""we're sorry\"" gesture which was appreciated, but still very rude to not let us know. \n\nAlso both times I used the restroom while I was there I had to deal with nastiness in the toilet. Almost all of the stalls had something gross in them. Clearly their to busy standing around chit chatting than to attend to the restrooms and make sure their clean.\n\nThe rest of the theater was nice but  from now on we will be going to a different theater."
"It took me until this year (my fourth year living in Edinburgh) to get around to going to Greens Deli. I mean, it's not because I never wanted to, but because I'd only ever heard rumour of its existence, and people never tended to elaborate on what they served there. They just tended to see you gotta get there early, or there won't be any ingredients left. So, one day, I did. \n\nGreens Deli is the typical kind of student foody place to go. It's right next to the George Square library and the other abominable buildings that the university has built around George Square, and where it educates its students. This means that around 1, the place is packed with really hungry kids. \n\nThe fillings are really delicious, and the price is OK for how good it is. I don't know of any other sandwich place that has roasted courgettes AND aubergines AND peppers as fillings. And the honey mustard sauce is delicious. One warning, though. If you go here and decide to take your panini or wrap out to the park to eat (or wherever), be careful or you definitely will get covered in sauce."
"Every meal I have here is good.  I love the pancakes and breakfast burrito.  The staff is very nice and helpful (love Donna Jo), the service is great and the price is right.  :)"
Pricey for what you get. Pretty good flavor. Service was ok. I'd say go to Elmer's right down the street instead.
"The \""lil bit o salmon\"" is off the chain! Hearty and delicious! Service is always welcoming and the desserts are awesome! I hate that it gets so crowded at lunch - but thats what happens when you serve up solid food for decent prices!\n\nYou have to try this place, definitely a hidden gem in Tempe!"
"Their employees are extremly rude.  Unfortunately, I did not catch her name - But\nWhen we first approached, she rudely told us to go to the kiosk as she\n\""just got there and wasnt ready\"" - After going to the kiosk, and it not\naccepting us, we went to her counter and she said \""well if it rejected you\nthen I cant help you\""  I asked her to try it again, and she agreed finally\nafter rudely asking me if I \""was even old enough to drive\""  Mind you, Im 24\nyears old.\n\nEven after she printed our confirmation, and I told her that she was being\nrude, she stated - \""Well I just got here so I dont know what you expect\nfrom me\""  That's not an apology, just more of a \""too bad.\""\n\nShe was extremly rude, and acting as if doing her basic job was a problem.\nJust to mention, there were no other customers in line or at the counter we\nwere the only ones so she wasnt even busy..\n\nFrankly, the ONLY reason we continued with Hertz and didnt go to one of the\nother 20 companies was Hertz deposit was lower than the rest.  Had the\ndeposits matched elsewhere we surely would of went elsewhere based soley\non the employees attitude."
Dr. Glen and Dr Schmidt are so wonderful as well as the staff. I have several kitties that go there and get the best care. I love how caring they are. Dr. Glen was so helpful and loving as my kitten was sick and dying. My cats always do well in the office since its a calm environment. I absolutely recommend this office!
"I've been here twice and liked it both times.  I love that they have a live band during the evenings.  The last one was really good.  The food is decent as well--there aren't a lot of options for vegetarians and almost none for vegans, but you can find something I suppose.  It's located in the Village in Ballantyne, so that alone means its a pretty nice establishment.\n\nWait staff was friendly, outdoor seating was nice--overall, it's a nice place."
"First class experience all the way!\n\nI decided to treat myself to a staycation for my birthday this year and when I was looking at rates and locations, I decided to go with The Boulders. I made my reservation and the personal concierge Carol was in touch a few weeks before my stay just to check if there was anything she could take care of before I arrived, which I really appreciated. \n\nWe checked in Saturday afternoon which was quick and easy. Carol recognized me as I was checking in and the experience was pleasant. Our casita wasn't too far from the lounge but we used the golf carts the majority of the time we were there - the drivers were all super friendly. The room - gorgeous! Nice little kitchenette, wonderful seating area with the worlds most comfortable leather chairs, huge comfy bed, and giant bathroom and closet area. \n\nAfter getting settled in, we headed off to the main pool for a little bit and had a drink while we were there. Afterwards we headed off-site for dinner, returned to check out Sunset Pointe, and then retired to our room for the night. While we were there, Carol must have took notice that I was visiting for my birthday and sent over a bottle of wine and a chocolate/fruit dessert - 5 stars for Carol!! Before we left for breakfast, we checked out the spa and the pool near the front. We learned that we could have used the sauna, steam room, and jet spa while we were there - a note to remember for next time. The pool by the spa looked to be more \""chill\"", and they have an organic garden where it appears you can pick fresh herbs and veggies. \n\nI had a fantastic time. It's far enough from the city and the surroundings are so beautiful you forget that you're still just a few miles outside of Scottsdale. The staff was great, the grounds were beautiful, and I'll definitely be back in the future."
"It must be coincidence that my ROTD pick is the place where I reconnected with Eric R. last year and is where he proposed to me last night!\n\nAfter a marvelous dinner at Shabu Shabu Paradise sitting next to Katrina M., we made our way to the M to \""walk off dinner\"" and go to the wine bar.  We had 2 wine tastings, then I asked Eric if he was ready to go...he said no, he wanted more hahaha!  Well I went to the restroom and when I came back and sat down, he says he got me a gift in Texas, gets down on one knee, and asks me to marry him!\n\nJay, the awesome Hostile Grape staff, took some pictures and brought us champagne!  I was in shock so I can't remember all of the details :)  There was a guy and 2 ladies next to us who also sent some wine over for us to celebrate.  We took turns going upstairs to call our parents and left tipsy and stuck together like stamps to a letter!\n\nThanks Hostile Grape and Jay for the special experience, the champagne, and the memories!!!! :-P"
"Run don't walk AWAY from Dollar Rent A Car in Treasure Island! Starting with an hour wait to get service  ( with only three people in line) to them not knowing exactly which floor of the parking garage the car was on to the deceitful billing practices this company is shameful! \n\nTheir trick was to charge your for more than you had stated you wanted, then you look at a tiny screen(after waiting for an hour and on the verge of being late for a meeting) and hit agree. What we thought we were agreeing to was $150 but the billed totaled over $300 for 27 hours!\n\nWe had the same experience with the \""Free\"" GPS offer as another reviewer, which is not free at all.\n\nWe called customer service and tried to explain that we had not wanted all the add on coverage we were charged for and that we were told we would not be charged for a second day but just for three extra hours, but that was not what they billed for. They just stated that we had hit the \""I agree\"" button.\n\nWhat a horrible experience! I suppose they make their stock holder happy by robbing their customers but is that the kind of business that you want to support? Shame on you Dollar Rent A Car."
"We grabbed antoher quick meal in here tonight and they pulled it off yet again. The food was great, the service was friendly and Unlike last time I saw that they offer free Wi-Fi for customers.  Feel free to order the carne asada yelp... It's Excellent."
"I really hate their food. Everything is disgusting. The wings, the shrimp, the oysters, EVERYTHING. We went there and I love fish and chips so I ordered it. One bite and I was done. It was awful. Puke worthy awful. I ended up only eating the curly fries that came with it. Anyway, the manager noticed I didn't eat any of it, so he decided to take it off our bill which was super nice. It was one star food, but because the manager was nice enough to acknowledge the fact that I didn't like it so I shouldn't have had to pay for it, was why they got another star. Way to go on customer service!"
"Call it sushi ugh!!! Went there on Monday \""all-you-can eat\"". NOT worth it. 1st - not all sushi in the menu can be ordered. 2nd, the waitress told us there was a 1 hr time limit!!! There was only one sushi chef. We had to wait for our order as there were more people. Not worth your money. BEWARE!!!"
"Hey folks, this is the Bellagio Cafe in Las Vegas not Denny's in Podunkville, so it's going to be on the expensive side, but you do get what you pay for and what you don't!  What you don't get . . . ketchup in dirty refilled bottles, sticky maple syrup bottles, paper napkins, and the list goes on and on!\n\nWhat you do get is great atmosphere, delicious food and courteous service. Even while standing line (and there often is a long line), you get to enjoy the stunning seasonal display and fragrant smells of the Bellagio Conservatory. Our favorite spot to sit is in the clover-shaped 4-plex booth to the left when you walk up the ramp, facing the conservatory . . . what a view and you get some of the best people watching in Vegas!\n\nThe food is consistently delicious.  Over the years (most recently in early March 2012), we have tried just about everything on the breakfast and lunch menus. For breakfast, I highly recommend the Bellagio Classic Omelet or the Maryland Crab Cake Benedict.  I always ask for my eggs on the soft side and they have never failed me. I also like my hash browns well, almost burnt, and they for the most part, that's what I get. For lunch, try the Cobb. My husband swears by it!\n\nCoffee is top notch, and they will leave a carafe on your table. They have real cream or milk, not the faux stuff that comes in mini plastic cups. I adore the fact that when you order an iced tea, the ice cubes are actually made with the tea itself as well. \n\nWe used to love to linger in the cafe when they had Keno, but they have removed the game it seems from all MGM Mirage properties across the board. So sad! We really missed it on this trip!"
I just spent $48.13 on dinner and their is plastic in my ice cream. I took a picture of my receipt . I joke not I could have died and the staff just didn't care.   \nOh no I won't return here nope not for all the money in Vegas. Funny thing is when the manager came over to talk to us her attitude was extra happy almost like a stepford wife. She happily said oh I know where the plastic is from! Then she followed up by  just excusing herself by saying oh sometimes plastic gets left on cookies nothing major. Hon its major because had that plastic got stuck in my throat...I could have died.\n Now her attitude that was nice or overly nice bugs me for one reason. I as the customer would like to know that what bugs me bugs you as well. Not that I'm upset and you making like you having the best day ever.\n When she came to the table I need you to understand I had just finished gaging as if I could not breath pulling plastic out my mouth. So I would have liked to know that she was concerned with my well being as a human and also a client. For example Like can you ask me if I'm ok. Do I need a glass of water. She should  have been more helpful. Instead of oh my these things happen...here is your 8 bucks back have a nice day. Good GOD shes a clueless chick. Where can you eat and have plastic in your food and the manager will say its ok it happends. Well because of her own words my friends I will say don't eat at this location because her happy go lucky attitude says she will allow this to keep on happening and our safety as humans are of no importance to her. Because should we choke on plastic oh well it happends.
"My fianc\u00e9 and I recently returned home from a trip to fabulous Las Vegas after stay 12/26/13-12/29/13 and staying and the FLAMINGO !! This wasn't our first trip to Las Vegas nor was it the first stay at the Flamingo. It was however the very worse stay I have ever had in any Las Vegas hotel, rude staff horrible customer service and down right horrible house keeping. Aside from all that the real topper was cockroaches the we found in our room. I'm willing to provide the exact number. 15139 and what the hotel desk manager MELINDA said. \"" well this is the desert, what do you expect ?\""  She is a liar and by far the very worst customer service representative I've ever dealt with in 30 years and several. Need less to say they did not stay true to their word and are very very lousy at what they do. I will be following up with. MELINDA'S bosses and pushing strong for some corrective measures and proper training. Lastly $45.36 would not brake the bank for a hotel of that volume and we simply wanted 1 night room rate returned as PROMISED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND MY WORSE ENEMY TO STAY THERE AND WE WILL NEVER SET FOOT INTO THAT ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN."
"I came here to help prevent wear and tear on my body for the upcoming year of teaching. 12 years of standing all day is making for tired feet and tiny veins on my legs. This store had a great selection of inserts for shoes to help with arch support. The very sweet and helpful clerk walked me through which items would work best for me. She took my measurements to get me the exact size pair of socks. I left with a pair of insoles and compression socks. The store was clean, organized, and the clerks were very pleasant."
Too bad they're closed on sunday. Definitely better than mcdonalds. I love this place!
"I used to be a huge huge fan of this place.  But, recently they seem to have quality control issues.  One issue has been the bread---which used to be nothing short of awesome.  One a couple of recent visits (off the lunch time rush) the bread tasted like it had been sitting around (in one case, the sandwich was inedible).  A second issue has been seasoning, which used to be perfect.  In one case, the sandwich lacked any taste and in another case, the moz was unevenly salted.  All of these are \""sins\"" that are excusable from an ordinary sandwich shop with ordinary prices.  (Well, the inedible sandwich isn't excusable...)  But, I expect much better from PB."
"Good food, friendly wait staff, causal atmosphere and great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner for a relaxing meal. If you are looking for an adventure into the best of wine from Arizona, you can get it there."
"Wow is a good way to start with. I was blown away with this show. Words are hard to put together to show how much i loved it! A Beatles Tribute it is, the music had everyone moving to the beat. It was AWESOME for me and the Wife to see. It was the best show we have ever seen. And the best of Cirque du Soleil, I'd have to say."
A wash may be better priced than others but you'll get what you pay for. My husband brought out 2008 Prius for a wash and vacuum and it doesn't look like anything has been cleaned! The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.
"I honestly can't say I've been to a worse cycle store. I've dealt with this place in both parts and service and they get nothing right. I've ordered parts that, after explaining in detail what I need, had the wrong part ordered. \""I know exactly what you're talking about.\"" Famous last words. Common parts that they don't even stock. \n\nI took my bike there to have a service done. The guy told me there would be a wait because they have so much work ahead of my bike. I'm patient, but after almost 2 weeks, right when I'm about to call, I get a LETTER IN THE MAIL saying they DON'T HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER to contact me. I called them and they not only had a number, but the RIGHT NUMBER. I had to wait for something in the mail when these guys had my number. The service guy said it was some woman's number. I called my number from work. It was the generic computer voice. Yes, a female computer voice. \n\nWhen I called back a couple of days later, he said he'd been trying to call that number, but it still didn't work. Every phone I used reached my phone. Two days later, the one person in a motorcycle store who knows how to use a phone called me (same number) to tell me the bike is ready. This is THREE WEEKS LATER. To make up for it, they took a couple bucks off the bill. \n\nNow I have a motorcycle that I'm going to have to piece together after having to take it apart and learn how to FIX WHAT THEY BROKE. Loose hoses, incomplete work, garage full of pulled apart  motorcycle pieces. It was an expensive lesson to learn, but I will NEVER set foot in this place again and will steer any friend I have away from this DUMP."
"I recently went to Space for my first time.  Having read and heard great things from people, I decided to try it out for myself.  I am certainly glad I did.  \n\nWhen I first walked up, John opened the door and I instantly recognized him from having at least a few cocktails in passing over the years.  We quickly figured out we knew a few mutual friends and both enjoyed many of the same neighborhood and not so distant restaurants.  John proceeded to ask me how my day was going, how I was feeling and from there, he asked to me get comfortable.  His studio is an addition to his house and he did it right.  Great attention to detail, great design and very tranquil space.  \n\nI won't go on an on but I will tell you this is the best overall massage experience I have ever had.  It's like Yoda meets KYOT with groove that The Merc Bar had when they first opened years ago.  Basically, the bomb.  All things converge into one experience to make it amazing: the massage, the setting, the music, etc.\n\nAnd a new friend on top of that.  Thanks John."
First time going here. Horrible service. Wouldn't recommend anyone going here. I was told two ppl would do my micros n it would take 5 hours at the most but only one person braided my hair and it took nearly 8 hours. The braiders were rude and didnt even acknowledge my presence except when they asked me to pay. It was the most uncomfortable 8 hours I've experienced while getting my hair braided.
Love this place!  Huge effing burger for a great price!  Delicious options!
"Okay, I'm from San Diego. I love everything Mexican and Fish Tacos are a must. Unfortunately, I've found this place to be more trendy than good. When I received my fish tacos they looked like what I expected except for one thing. If the fish was breaded at the restaurant then why bother breading fish pieces. The fish itself was fine but I received pieces. Typically, if you cut the fish correctly you won't have pieces. The batter was okay but I've fish sticks for Gorton's that were better. The batter had absolutely no flavor. It just seemed that someone took the time to decorate but I felt that I was served leftovers. I'm going to look somewhere else for fish tacos in the future.\n\nIf you ever in San Diego then try Rubio's, which is a fast food fish taco place and they seem to know what to serve the customer and what not to serve the customer. Cabo's didn't feel that way. At I could have received the same dinner for half the price but with a lot more flavor."
"Coffee, Vinyl, and Bechamel....oh, how much the Beat reminds me of a coffeehouse on Clement street in SF that my little brother used to play beats at, in fact they have open mic nights just like the Beat does!\n\nSince moving to my new neighborhood, I've been to the Beat twice now, both times my coffee was, well, coffee. But both times, the mister had their breakfast croissant and he LOVED it.  I had the ham and cheese grilled sandwich and what caught my eye was the bechamel...it was oowey-gooeey goodness...."
ugh. mediocre at best.
Great food again an great service. Love the thai tea..has become a fav place..
"I stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered the mahi mahi plate.  When I opened the container, I looked at the fish and it definitely didn't look like mahi.  It looked like the fillet of a small fish where they butterfly it before frying.  When I tasted it, I definitely knew it wasn't  mahi.  I do some boat fishing in Hawaii and eat mahi quite often so I know the taste.  This definitely was something else.\n\nRather than making a scene, I ate the \""fish\"" plate and left.  I hope Eddie Flores reads this and puts quality control procedures in place and insists that his franchisees adhere to the good quality control that made L & L popular in the first place.\n\nI won't ever eat at that location again!"
"One Of my favorite bars in Pgh:) they have a wide variety of beers on tap and there is always specials running everyday of the week... Appetizers are delicious, burgers are well stacked and sum pretty yummy wings! you can buy the sacuses for the wings which is amazing!! I recomend the teriyaki or the honey BBQ wings!"
"Best.Gelato.In.Vegas.  It's a must stop whenever i'm in Vegas.  Creamy, smooth consistency, delicious - AMAZING!  I've never been disappointed when I've gone, except when it's closed.\n\nI always get the same:  stracciatella and hazelnut and it's consistently good.  And reasonably priced with plenty of seating on a normal day."
"Umm, how the heck did I think this place was a \""casual lounge\""?? I suggested this place since we were looking for somewhere low-key for after dinner drinks, and somehow we ended up in the monstrosity of a night club where some girl actually drunk walked / vomited simultaneously on our table, my friend's jeans and my sister's Manolo Blahniks.\n\nSo the DJ only plays each song for about 3 seconds and the light up foamies were giving me severe motion sickness (It felt like I was in a moving tunnel!), and if we forget about the whole projectile vomit incident, the night was a ton of fun. I danced all night and nearly forgot I had an unattended baby (AKA Panda) sleeping back at the hotel room. \n\nAnd to think I almost thought I was *too old* to be going to night clubs. But thank goodness the pain from my platforms didn't kick in until AFTER I got out of the cab :)"
"CLOSED!!!!\n\nIt is close to work, so I went back had a hot ham and cheese it was quite good and the service was much better.  Tried to go back again last week and it's closed.  No sign, emptied out."
"Every time that I have been to Montreal in the last six years, I have gone to Schwartz's.  More because of my husband's affliction for it: If we're in the city, he needs to go and get his fix. After all this time, I don't blame him.\n\nEveryone has their own way of ordering - and I don't judge (unless that way is 'lean'; that I don't understand.) You might want a cherry coke with your sandwich. You might eat your sandwich with a knife and a fork. And that's fine. (My order? A sandwich, fries to share, a pickle, cherry coke. The A1 steak sauce needs to be nearby, too.)\n\nI don't know if I would call this place 'the best restaurant in Canada' or 'the Katz's of Montreal', but it is terribly good smoked meat, in a style very different from New York delis (bagels and smoked meat - it's what sets New Yorkers and Montrealers apart). It's mouthwateringly delicious, served in a setting that requires that you get close to your neighbour (and I've had some great conversations as a result).\n\nThe line appears daunting, but the guy manning the door knows what he's doing. Trust him. Trust the staff inside. Trust the smoker in the kitchen that has been churning out incredible sandwiches for the past 82 years.\n\nI just hope that Celine Dion doesn't mess it up when the sale is finalized."
"I asked them if they had a business card. They said no. I asked \""so what is your business name then\"". We don't have one was the reply. They are spray painters and so that's all I can list them as.\n\nThese artists are at the Fremont Street Experience 7 days a week. Located outside the El Portal Indian Arts & Crafts Store, these guys will paint a design for you either from their list of designs or you can make your own.\n\nIt takes the guy about 10 mins to complete a painting. The passers by surround them like flies to honey, watching him create a painting from start to finish. Lil guy was mesmerized by them. When the lights came on, he looked at it for about a minute and then continued to watch the guy complete his painting. He could've watched all night long except after about 5 paintings, the guys took a break, so we moved on.\n\nThe paintings aren't really my style, but some of them were pretty damn good."
Absolutely enjoyed the dinner I had here.   Service was excellent and I have some very good memories from the dinner here.  A true pleasure and enjoyable experience.  Highly recommended.
"I  think your review of this place depends on what you order. The menu is very very random. I ordered the fish and chips and it was really good. The fish was cut in large generous square pieces and cooked throughly. The seasoning was only on the batter but the quality of the fish was so good that you didn't even notice. The fries were hot and fresh and the service was amazing. \n\nWhy did I give this place a 4 instead of a 5? The water was sooo gross. If you are going to serve water in a restaurant please use a filter, because faucet water is not good and it has an obvious taste. When I told the waiter about the water she look \""appalled\"" and said \""its filtered\"". I politely just ordered some apple juice, which she didn't charge me for. \n\nHopefully they invest in a quality water filter. Other than that I thought the food I ordered was great and the service was really nice."
"Had a great time tonight, our server Mandy was fantastic, very sharp and on point with our order!! I am sitting in her section from now on."
"Can i give this place zero stars?????  $85.00 for a \""Deluxe\"" Pedicure and it was the worst, quickest, wambam thankyou mam pedicure.  Horrible!!!!!  They won't be getting another dime of my money.  If I could give this place zero stars I would."
"Wow.... has this corner of Sunnyslope changed!\n\n10 years ago I worked in an office building across the street, at an Internet startup. The day we moved in, there was a double homicide at the Circle K on Dunlap and Central. After that, I brought my baseball bat to work every day, because I usually didn't leave until late at night when crack zombies congregated in the parking garage below the building. I called it \n\""Louis,\"" my coworker called it (very Un-PC) the Ethnic Cleanser. \n\nNow.... the ghetto elements are gone, and there is a wonderful wine bar with an even better patio.\n\nWe put down a bottle of the Rose - it was very, very tasty and drinkable. We went on a Sunday, all they serve then is their breakfast menu. Well... it rocked. I had the veggie and cheese omelette, my guest had the chorizo wrap. Both were superb! The service was attentive, the ambiance was awesome both indoors and outdoors. The patio is shaded by some giant mesquites, with comfortable couch and chair seating. \n\nI'll be back! Especially for the goat and sheep cheese plate, and to try some of the rest of their fantastic wine selection. Ole!"
"Animal. Style. \n\nI see you baby, slathering my cheeseburger with special sauce and pickles and onions. And oh God, is that mustard in the burger? \n\nHow dare you! To think I would ruin such an amazing creation with a tomato or lettuce. No such healthy stuff here. Puh-lease. \n\nOh and the way I pour that Root Beer. Oooh baby, that's it. So refreshing. \n\nWhy do I make your fries so limp, baby? If I could change one thing about you, sugar, just crisp up those fries... For me? \n\nWe don't have to fight, just hand me that stack o napkins and everything will be all right. You know I love you.\n\nAnimal style."
"I have been coming here for awhile, and truth be told, the quality is getting worse.\n1st tip: DO NOT EVEN BOTHER with the fried oysters. You will hate yourself for ordering that. The oysters are so tiny, and it's not worth the money. Actually put the gator bites on the do-not-order list as well. They're smaller than the popcorn chicken you get at KFC. \nI normally come here and order the gumbo or she crab soup and make that a meal. A bowl runs you about $8-9, which is a lot more tolerable. Sometimes the gumbo comes out luke warm (at best), but it tastes good enough.\nIf anything, consider this place for a drink, they do have drink specials on the hurricanes and wine and beer. \nI really hate that one of the few cajun places in Charlotte is going downhill."
"I exist in the world of shared-custody or partial custody of a pooch. The 'ex' has her company most of the time, I usually enjoy her when he's traveling or not looking. \n\nRecently, I took care of her while he was away. She and I had a party. We went running, walking, and she sniffed her way through my neighborhood. We headed to Chaparral Dog Park, and I have to say, I was so pleased at how clean and well kept the area is. My tax dollars are being well utilized.\n\nThe park is crowded, but its a good crowd. Everyone seems to have the same mission: to let their dogs sniff, run, play and socialize with other dogs, while they sniff, run, play and socialize with each other. Its pretty much a win-win!"
"Absolutely delicious!!! first time visitors get a free banana nut muffin and it's so warm and soft. My wife ordered the stuffed French Toast which also comes with a side of potatoes.  Her plate was huge and of course wasn't able to finish it. I had the Country fried skillet, I almost wished I would've gotten a half portion but didn't know it was an option until I overhead another waitress mention it. it was definitely amazing though.  I added the red hot sauce that is on every table and Daaaaaamn.... Excuse my gangsta but THAT SHIT WAS AMAZING!!! Definitely will come by next Vegas trip!"
"I used to be a loyal men's warehouse shopper. I had a casual job and only needed to wear suits sporadically. I have recently taken a job where I have to dress formally everyday. I was in the store to buy a few new suits and am very unhappy with how one of them fits. I feel like a 10 year old wearing my dads suit. It is gigantic. After a few alterations the suit still felt big. When I had it altered initially I mentioned that the suit was huge and the store associate darla said it looked good and they couldn't take it in anymore. A few weeks later I wore the suit once and it was horrible. Jacket was too long and the pants made me feel like I was wearing a tent. I took it back. They said they could alter it. The staff was not apologetic for not doing it right the first time and overall the team was very unfriendly. Like I was an inconvenience in their day. They said they could alter it would cost me another $15 and would take almost 10+ days. I will get this suit, but will not be buying anything here again. The sales lady was constantly blaming the other tailors for doing a poor job and said the best tailor was back and that the other tailors were not very good. I will not be back. If this is how your staff treat each other. No wonder the client experience was so poor. Epic fail."
Do NOT go there for waxing services! I went there to get my legs waxed and had the most horrible experience ever. The woman who attended to me did not know how to wax - not even that skin needs to be held tight in order to really remove hair. She applied wax and very gently peeled off the strips so I was left with a lot of wax-covered hair. At the end she asked me to take a look and I found large sections where no hair had been removed. I had to walk her through it but she still couldn't pull off the strips in the right way. And did I mention that she burned me in a few places with this special microfiber wax she recommended? I had to go home and shave most of my legs which was painful because of all the burns... I couldn't wear jeans because they were too rough for my scarred skin and I couldn't go out wearing skirts or dresses. I paid close to $100 for a lot of pain. The salon should seriously consider changing its waxing practices before they get sued by someone.
The sushi here is always fresh and delicious.  Not crazy about there entries. There spicy tuna roll is jam packed with tasty tuna. Very good sushi bar.
"I thought I would really like this place, but I just don't find anything really special. \n\nThe burgers and fries are just so-so. Pretty pricey for a burger joint even for Vegas standards!\n\nGood that it's open 24 hours."
"I got take out cuz I was too lazy to cook!  =)\n\nI ordered:\n\nWonton Soup with pork - Good and flavorful\nPhad See Ew - It was pretty good\nThai BBQ Pork - I did not like the flavor\n\nNext time I am sticking with my usual (Phad Thai, BBQ Chicken, Satay)"
"Hula is a cheerful and warming spot, especially on the gray winter days while we were in Edinburgh.  It is well-located right off of Grassmarket on the sloping Victoria Street (filled with its own delicious wonders), and was the husband and my favorite place for breakfast during our few days exploring the city.\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly and gave helpful recommendations, not just about the fare but also about local places to check out around Edinburgh.\n\nTheir porridge made me really love Scottish porridge, and their hot drinks (teas, coffee, espresso drinks) were well made.  It was also the first place where we tried a flat white, which hasn't made its way to the \""colonies\"" (aka the US).  And they stock our favorite porridge bars (a great upgrade from the sad, hard granola bars we know across the Atlantic).\n\nI know Hula is called a juice bar, but for some odd reason - perhaps the hour of the day - we never got juice there.  Next time, though!  I'm looking forward to dropping in on our next visit."
"My friend hired Cuteology Cakes to do dessert tiers  for my recent baby shower.  They were absolutely adorable and delicious!  Not only were they presented beautifully, they tasted yummy.  There were three tiers made up of chocolate dipped oreos, red velvet cake balls, and banana chocolate mini cupcakes.  The guests loved them, as did I!"
"Food is good but service is awful!!! We went twice and each time it's the same thing, takes forever to get waited on, servers don't check back to see if you need anything and one time they took so long to wait on us that dim sum ended. Don't waste your time go to Changs on Decatur instead! I would not recommend unless you want subpar food at over the top prices."
Excellent food! Excellent service and great ambience. Will definitely come back on my next trip to Arizona
"I really have mixed feelings about this place. If I were to base the rating solely on the all glorious Volcano Roll...this place would get 5 stars. Unfortunately I have to consider other things that detract from the love of one roll. I have been going to this place for years. My family from the east coast always request to go here when they are in town (which maybe more of a fascination with the AYCE thing.) I ate here a few weeks ago and was very sadly disappointed. The hubby and I sat at the sushi bar. The place wasn't busy by any stretch of the imagination yet the orders we placed took an insanely long time to prepare. We ordered Cajun albacore, hamachi, a volcano roll and a Todd roll. We also ordered shrimp tempura from the kitchen and calamari. We quickly got edemame and started to devour it. We then got our tempura orders. This whole time I am watching the sushi chef that took my order...chopping something for another dish, or to stock they're bar, or whatever. We waited 20 minutes for the Cajun albacore!!!! In the meantime another couple came in and ordered a roll. The same sushi chef that took my order...made a Philly roll and gave it to them....I just glared at him thinking when are you gonna make my sushi rolls???? My hubby (very mild-mannered and timid) was begging me not to say something. Then (under my constant glare) the sushi chef made our hamachi and the other 2 rolls. It took 30 minutes to get this little amount!!!!! Aside from that. I actually had to get out of my seat and go over to the waitress (talking to the other waitress) to get me a drink refill (much to the chagrin of my hubby.) I was never asked for a refill on any of the tempura orders ( which are included in the AYCE menu.) \n\nI honestly believe that they stall making your sushi so that you will: \nA) get pissed off and leave! \nB) get full quicker since you are eating slower, and therefore you eat less. \nC) run out of the 45 minute time limit and not be able to order anymore. \n\nThis used to be such a good place, and such friendly people. I don't know if a new owner shook up the place or what...but it breaks my heart to say that I don't think I'll be going back here anytime soon."
Just went to metro pizza for the first time with my husband and the moment we walked into the door it was horrible. The hostess were very rude and unprofessional. The first server who came by and took our drink order heard my husbands and just assumed I wanted the same thing. Then our next server comes and is so impatient about us ordering... my husband asked about their beer and he seemed like he had no idea. We finally ordered and get our pizza and one of the pizzas came with sauce on the side (weird) and I asked the server what the sauces were and he answered me very rude. The moment I bite into our stuffed pizza it's very cold and the meatballs were not good. The server was also really bad at our refills. We really could not wait to leave and get our check which took 20 minutes after we asked for it.
"Ordered something I can't remember the name of but it was this doughy piece of fried? bread the size of a football that should have been stuffed with ham, cheese and a sauce.  What I got was a HUGE blob of bread with a very scant amount of ham, a few meager bits of cheese and no sauce that I could taste although there was a tinge of a pinkish moisture that I could see but not taste.  The food took forever to get to us which was somewhat of a mystery since the place just wasn't that busy.  Our server kept apologizing and he was attentive with a great personality but that couldn't make up for what was a completely unsatisfying dinner.  Doubt there will be a next time."
"If you've never to this Sweet Tomato before, I will tell you that the interior is vast. You can go roller skating from one end to the other without any issues.\nTonight per usual, we went down the line, paid, and was getting ready to look for a table to sit down to eat our dinner when the cashier said, \""wait. You have to wait to be seated.\""\nAt first, I thought she was uttering in foreign tongue cause I've been coming to this location for YEARS and we've never had to wait to be seated!\nTurns out, the place was fully booked. Full capacity- every booth and seat taken in the vast interior. \nVery impressive. Easily I want to say over 250 people dining at the same time???\nWay to go Sweet Tomato- you're doing something right!  \nI'm glad too- as I do enjoy the freshness and flavor of your soups and salads. \nAnd I can't wait until when you bring your French Onion soup back again!!!!"
"Sushi Kame is placed in downtown Champaign surrounded by the more pricey restaurant such as Jim Gould, Escobar, and Kofusion. You would expect some overpriced meals at Sushi Kame but the items on the menu is reasonably priced. The food is simple and not gimmicky like the trendier places in town. Also the people are very polite. \n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. If you would like a warm soup for you meal, go for the Udon soup (I believe it's $2.00 for one tempura shrimp to be added with the soup). If you want something with a little bit of everything, the bento box consist of the meat and served with 1 roll of California tempura, salad, and rice. More importantly, the sushi is great and they never run out of fish!"
"On our arrival in LV we decided to have our first meal in Wynn Hotel.   From our hotel Tropicana we had a long walk to get there.   There was a small line when we arrived, but that was expected.   The folks managing the line were creating the impression of a very busy environment.   However many spare tables were left as the staff were not able to clean them.   It was $75.56 ($37.78 per person), and not value for money.   The food was very mediocre and bland.   The most popular were crab legs and we did not really understand the hassle and a long line to get them.   We tried it as well but not a delicacy for us.   There are some better Buffets on the Strip e.g. Bellagio."
"The best part of our meal was the fruit fly I accidentally consumed while drinking my wine. Second best was the \""cheddar smashed potatoes\"" from a box. Third was the steak. Pictures and further comments available upon request."
"I went today for lunch. They have an all you can eat Lunch Special, for $9.97 you can graze their very nice salad and seafood bar plus a 4 dish hot section. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised, everything was really fresh and all the things I tried were Delicious. \n\nSome of the things I ate were, Tilapia with pineapple sauce, Potato Lasagna it was kind of like scalloped potatoes very thinly sliced with cheese in between, really tasty. Shrimp ceviche, roasted eggplant salad, fresh blanched broccoli salad, roasted zucchini salad, chicken salad, marinated mushrooms and some other things that are slipping my mind at the moment. \n\nSorry No pics this time, it would have been an awkward moment to whip out the camera in this setting being I was all by myself.  Hopefully next time I wont have to go alone ;-)\n\nI would surely go back for lunch again and maybe even dinner. Even though I'm not really a meat eater, there was plenty of vegetarian options to fill me up."
"Making my rounds of the steakhouses here in Vegas and this is a must stop for me.  There are 2 CG's in the L.A./O.C. area and I thought I'd try the one here in Vegas, since the restaurant is situated to have spectacular views of the strip.  In our case the Wynn and Encore and southward.  \n\nThe entrance (from the garage) was a ride up in the elevator directly into the elevator.  I had to adjust my eyes a bit because it was dark with dark mahogany furniture.  We had a table by the window and a birthday card with glitterati candy all over the table - here for my birthday.  Love that!\n\nI knew what I wanted to order, since a couple of days before.  I started with the lobster bisque with sherry.  The soup came out piping hot, not too thick and rich with a good amount of lobster strips.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and forgot that we had until midway into our dinner.  We both ordered the Delmonico steak.  I had my steak prepared medium rare and the hubs had it medium well.  Medium rare the way to go...yumm!  That was a juicy piece with browned fatty corners...mmmm. Tender and tasty.  I knew this steak was taking me down it was 22 ounces! I had a fist size left over which I had later that evening as a snack...yay!  Sam's mashed potatoes was smooth with some chunks of potatoes - gosh, that was creamy rich goodness.  The spinach which I thought was going to be creamed was actually lightly steamed with bacon, I think - the steak was so good that the sides were actually SIDES and not taking over the limelight.  I enjoyed both the mashed potatoes and the spinach.  I would order these again!\n\nI guess our server felt bad about forgetting the shrimp cocktail (and not that I was craving it or anything), so she brought our a cheesecake with berries for my birthday \""cake.\"" It had caramelized sugar on top and it was so moist that it just broke apart with your fork.  I don't like cheesecake really, but this was very good.  I didn't have a cocktail because I had been drinking most of the day and my tummy wasn't feeling so hot earlier, so I thought I'd take it easy, so I can have a pleasant rest of the night.\n\nThe service was okay and nothing over the top or spectacular.  Staff was attentive enough.\n\nI may visit one of the CG's here in L.A./O.C. At least I know what goodness awaits me."
"The House of Tricks is aptly named. They have a box full of \""tricks\"" to get you in the door along with many to make sure that you don't return. \n\nDon't be fooled! This clever house of tricks keeps their way over priced, mediocre food and horrible service well hidden until you, and your wallet, have already be taken. Quite the slight of hand!!\n\nI made the mistake of taking my family there for my wife's birthday (6 of us altogether). After sitting for 15 minutes we were greeted by Ben who immediately let us know through his inaction and disinterest that this was going to be a long night of \""no service\"". Ben didn't need to be concerned, though-he was getting his tip no matter what he did, or didn't do for this table. Our choice should have been Burger King for the service, if nothing else. Sorry, no disrespect to those who wear the crown ;-). The bottom line-the House of Tricks has THE WORST SERVICE in Arizona!!! \n\nTheir overpriced food features barely palatable dishes and the portions are small. If you eat there don't expect any \""wow\"" from the food. The only \""wow\"" you will get is when you see the bill!!\n\nIn this economy Arizona has seen the doors of many restaurants shut. We don't need a magic door at the House of Tricks, but we do need it to close!!!"
"I love love love this place!! What a little hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. Me and my girlfriend try to go at least once a week. It's such a hip, fun spot. The food is fantastic! I always get the Cash Money.  The dressing they use on their greens is to die for! Staff is very friendly as well. A great date spot- atmosphere is perfect...all candlelit once the sun goes down. And you gotta love the old school hip hop they blast! I recommend this spot to everyone I know!! \n\nThey are closed for a week and a half for vacation and I am already itching for them  to open!"
"My cousin took us (and about 10 other members of my family) here for dinner.  3 stars for quality of food and additional star for selection of food. We all got the all you can eat sushi, and for 10 fatties, it was a great deal.. 90 minute time limit was more than enough to stuff our faces with sushi.  I have to admit that the Nigiri was totally worth it.. fish to rice ratio was great.  Big pieces of fish with smaller amounts of rice made the hamachi nigiri a go-to favorite of the night.  Another must is the eggplant fries! My boyfriend isn't a sushi fan, but he loved the garlic chicken and the eggplant fries. \n\nAnother aspect on their menu is the malasada sundae... and their desserts in general.  A lot of sushi places just have green tea or mochi ice cream as a dessert... Island Sushi has tempura ice cream, brownie sundaes... yum.\n\n I would definitely come back on my next Vegas vacation."
"Great place (albeit pricey) for people watching, but they suck when it comes to gluten-free options.  They put on their menu that they have gluten-free buns (nice!), but almost everything on their menu is chock full of gluten (even Hollandaise sauce, which is just wrong, IMHO).  Server was attractive but uneducated about gluten-free.  Such a big, beautiful menu, but the gluten-free options were the same sad limited choices as any other restaurant's.  I ordered the Angus burger sans bun with goat cheese (an extra $1.50) in an attempt to spruce it up, but I needed a microscope to see the cheese.  Thankfully the cocktail was good."
"The breakfast is consistently great here at a reasonable price, and if you go to the Val Vista and Baseline store the customer service you will get from Hector is second to none"
"Great hotel. Great service from the front desk. Have no complaints about the hotel. \n\nThe only downside is the walk to casinos, though not too bad if you want to go to Aria. \n\nDefinitely worth the stay."
"This review is not for the shooting range, but for the instructor, Rick Barkett, who conducted our CCW course a few months back.\n\nThe entire class of about 50 people were in agreement, when I say that this guy is a MAJOR FUCKING ASSHOLE.\n\nHe was clearly disgusted that so many people, many of whom weren't very knowledgeable about firearms, could be attending a class for a concealed carry permit.\n\nNow, I would agree that some of them should know more about their pistols & revolvers before they try to carry them around in their back pockets, but since we live in a country where we still have the right to bear arms, and they were attending a class to follow legal protocol, I'd say that this guy should just shut the fuck up and teach his class without passing so much judgment on the students.\n\nIf nobody asked a question, he had a smart ass remark about that.  If somebody asked a question, he had an equally smart ass remark.\n\nDuring the shooting portion of the training, he was totally condescending towards everybody, although he did shut the fuck up with me when he saw all 15 of my bullseye shots!!\n \nThere was one guy who actually wanted to slash his tires after the course but reconsidered because of all the surveillance cameras at the joint.  THAT would have been funny.\n\nIf I ever see his name again for a training class, I'll be sure to skip it and attend elsewhere."
The greatest sandwich I have ever had my entire life. The owner is super nice and every person that works there treats you like a human being and not just a sale. Chris was so nice when he gave me my food and checked on me and asked how my food was. I plan on trying everything on the menu. The pesto sandwich was amazing. Chris recommended to chipotle next. I Know Where I'm GOING tomorrow!
"I have eaten at this Red Lobster for years. Recently things have slipped. Yesterday a group of us had dinner. One person ordered the fish and chips. What came was batter, no fish. Two us is had Cobb salads, poor...the lettuce was frozen in both salads. Needless to say this place needs a major over haul. The only good thing about this restaurant is the server Mary who is stellar. Too may other places to eat."
"It's a hotel desperately trying to be cool, sophisticated and stylish but loses a star because over the last few years the building is looking a bit worn, probably due to its owner going bankrupt in 2010.  We've stayed in the suites at the front over the last 4 years during the fringe - highlights are the huge rooms with floor to ceiling windows and, \""is that really porn in the hotel artwork?\"" and the snug bar around a fireplace upstairs..."
"Excellent Thai food and service.  Papya Salad, Silver Noodle Salad, Crab Fried Rice, Koaw Mun Gai.  Highly recommended!"
"If I had to sum up Gardunos in a word it would be bland. Bland rice, bland guacamole, bland fish tacos, even bland Shrimp Diablo. How can Shrimp Diablo be bland? Not a hint of spice, that's how. Shrimp Diblando. Gardunos is designed for people from the mid-west and east coast who aren't used to eating Mexican food, let alone spicy Mexican food: basically, a sexed-up Taco Bell with a tiny tequila selection."
"This area is teaming with unique options and real honest to goodness bargains. Stop by Magic Mushroom and get a burger, fries and a can of soda for $5 even. The owners start early in the morning to grind the meat fresh ever day that goes into the burgers, now that's some serious attention to detail. If available, and you're really hungry, try the Fat Ass ($7.50). This burger is just as much fun ordering, as it is eating. A couple of beef patties with all the fixings, plus bacon on a deliciously soft bun, sides of fries, onion rings and 2 sodas, whew! Go Fat Ass! \n\nInside Two Hippies there's enough tie-dyed, flower child kitsch packed into this place to transport you to the summer of love in one step through the door. Look out Brady's, there's a new bunch in town!"
Gluten free fried goodness! This is what I think every time I eat here. They have gluten free fried fish & chips and also onion rings. Their prices are super reasonable too! Located on rainbow & 215 area it's a great location. \nAlso the employees are super nice. I suggest everyone to try this hidden gem!
This place was bought out by another person a year ago. He named it Taka Sushi but hasn't changed the name on the outside.\n\nThere are a few servers left from the old owner but they hate it. Ending in service going down hill.
"After scheduling my appointment the receptionist called me twice for me to go in later. When I arrived I still waited thirty minutes (1 hour after my original appointment and 30 minutes after my second rescheduled appointment). The receptionist was not apologetic and the lady who was scheduled to cut my hair did not seem to feel bad, she wouldn't even look at me."
"We have been eating here for the last 7 years during CES.  It was always amazing.  We always looked forward to it.  However, the latest reviews I read prior to dining here the first week of 2013 indicated a decline in standards.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with those reviews.  The sushi was still very tasty.  Seafood still nice and fresh. The presentation was still gorgeous. The art of sushi as it affects quality is on the downhill slide.  The rolls were somewhat sloppy.  About 50% of the pieces fell apart when we tried to pick them up.  If they continue with this, they'll be forced to serve the sushi with a spoon. The edamame, Shumai and miso soup were all served at barely above room temperature.  A huge disappointment for such simple principles. Hot food- hot.  Cold food- cold.  As usual, the service was great and all the staff is very charming.  It makes me sad to think that we'll likely have to find a new sushi joint for next year."
"As I moved here from FL, where I am accustomed to excellent Cuban food, I tried to be as neutral as possible when reviewing this restaurant.  I ordered my old favorite, Vaca Frita, with Moro and a side of Maduros since the plates don't come with Maduros.  The Vaca Frita was extremely fatty and the Maduros were so scorched, I was trying to peel off the black parts to get to the sweet plantain portion, but they were not salvageable.  The restaurant looked clean and the staff was friendly so I may try this place one more time to give it a fair shake (will order the Lechon Asado/Pork instead though) so let's see what happens on try #2....for try #1, and for the drive I took to get there, I was not impressed."
"The spa has both things that I liked and disliked:\n\nLiked - every masseuse I've had. Always great technique. \n\nDisliked - I got a spray tan here and did everything as instructed to do (wait about 7 hours before showering, don't sweat, etc) but after all that, I wasn't any darker. I waited one day, as I have had spray tans before and sometimes I Ames 24 hours for the full color to show. Nothing. I called and asked for a partial refund and they declined. It wasn't cheap either! \nAlso, the shower area needs to be redone, badly. Very old tile - I think from back when it used to be the Alladin. \n\nMake sure, if you're a local, ask which days they do local's discounts because it makes a big difference!"
"The food here is scrumptious, with an emphasis on seafood, south-of-the-border spiciness and some special touches from the chef. I highly recommend the green chile lobster dip as an appetizer--truly my favorite dip ever (the fresh fried flour tortilla chips don't hurt.) From there, it doesn't seem you can go wrong. Plenty of entr\u00e9es to choose from, running the gamut from burgers to enchiladas to various fish. A couple of veg options. The green salsa is pitch-perfect. There are specials on the board when you walk in. I've always finished just full enough to not want dessert (though I could say I perpetually want sopapillas) but not needing to take home leftovers.\n\nFrom the outside, the restaurant doesn't look very promising, with its shabby exterior, location next to a paint-ball club on a ghetto stretch of Country Club Road (though which part of this road isn't ghetto?). Inside, the ambiance changes to comfortable, well-lit and nicely decorated. Enter and it will be worth your while. (Only caution is to open both left and right taps at bathroom sink or risk getting scalded)\n\nI've gone to this location twice and haven't ever had trouble getting seating for two. Likewise I've enjoyed good service. It seems there have been multiple reservation fiascos because they haven't figured out how to handle larger crowds, which is a pity. I have yet to try their Scottsdale location but will report on it soon."
"this place is super inexpensive and really fast, great place to take a quick lunch break"
The new owners of Ice House Tavern are no longer hosting live bands. This is such a disappointment to the local music scene!
This place is great! Meat falls off the bone and the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes are so yummy!
I don't know about the cowboy boots but almost everyone of the work boots are made in China. I have been wearing Justin work boots from here for 16 years but now they have hardly any Justins at all and it's the only boot they have that is made in the USA. I am not ready to buy China boots.
"Party of 4, on a Wednesday night, first timers, all food was very good. The carpaccio and the crab cakes were a great way to start this start this meal, the beef tartare main was also delicious.  The Petit Pot de caramel was so very good, it wasn't shared at all!  Attentive service and bilingual.  C\u00f4t\u00e9 Maison seemed quieter than the main dinning area, which was a good thing. One small disappointment: the washroom, C\u00f4t\u00e9 Maison."
"Wow, I am surprised at the last review.  I have found the food at Bada Boom Pasta Room to be excellent every time I have been there.  I am in love with Mr. Pink's Pasta. It has a delightful vodka sauce, and you can also add proscuitto wrapped shrimp as well. They have a fantastic martini selection a well, and the decor it hip and fun.  Did anyone say red velvet walls?  Great place!"
"Our family has frequented Shogun for years and we are done. The service is awful and the food has gone  downhill. While I hope that their manager Shelly has success turning it around, it is obvious that the owners don't care. Our friends are saying the same thing."
"I am so sad to say this is the worst customer service place ever. I went there a couple of times when they were on Dunlap and they were always cold and very unfriendly.\n\nI do not know why they were so cold.  They did not say hi to me and they said hello to my husband when he walked in way after me because he was parking the car,  I told my husband to stop there to see  what they had.  It was my idea.  I walked in smiling and made eye contact by nothing.  I wanted to spend money there. They greeted and welcomed my husband but not me?  I was dressed well.   The only difference was is my husband is not Hispanic.  The last three times I was there it happened each time. I walked out and will not  go there again.  Sad."
"Finding indoor activities for toddlers is challenging in the heat of the AZ summer, but thanks to an invitation from my friend Jane B, I took my little one to check this place out this past weekend, and we had a blast!\n\nThe location is not the most convenient for me, but even considering the 30 minute drive, it was worth it to get an hour of solid playtime for sure... and of course, my son slept great after class too!\n\nI loved the casual and extremely clean environment at Gymboree, and I also loved that there was plenty of time when we arrived to get settled and play on our own before the official class began.  The structured class was great as we went from activity to activity including climbing, sliding, jumping, singing, pushing bouncing, and bubbles too!  I also like that they break down each class by age, so all of the kids in the class we attended were close in age and activity level.\n\nWe didn't join, but we do plan on dropping in for class again in the near future.  I also hear this is an excellent venue to host a party, so I'll keep that in mind for the future too.  Thanks Gymboree!"
"I can't say enough about how much we love this place! We first went to the farm for my son's second birthday and did the hayride and petting zoo tour. We loved picking flavors at the milk bar and hand feeding the animals. We went again after purchasing a Groupon and are now Dairy Club members. I really enjoy getting close to the source of our food and trying out all the special nosh that the chefs whip up. From peanut butter ice cream, garlic & herb butter, red pepper aioli, to the awesome chicken salad- we are hooked!"
"No. With all of your other options in Vegas for buffets (Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal), this just doesn't cut it. Food was dry, sitting out too long, and the cheaper price attracts a ...cheaper crowd...if you know what I mean. You're in Vegas, spring for the good buffet!"
"Hotel rooms are pretty gross. Carpets are so dirty that our feet got black. When we first checked in, there were stains on our bed sheets and pillows. GROSS. I guess you can say that you get what you pay for.. Cheap hotel. At least there was a mini fridge.\n\nBuffet was awesome though!"
"i'd go here lots if i lived here. affordable prices (esp. happy hour), close to lots of stuff and the terasse is perfect for people watching. mediterranean menu items were simple and refreshing. perfect for a hot and humid day."
"This place is AMAZING!!! During the week they do lunch specials, which is only $10 for my fav, the teriyaki chicken. It's amazing! Never had teriyaki chicken like this and so good!! It also comes with California rolls, fried vegetables, salad (I don't care for, I substitute it for white rice) AND miso soup. Way more than I can eat but I try!\nThey also have jalape\u00f1o poppers, which are not your ordinary jalape\u00f1o poppers. They are my FAV. I could eat them everyday, all day.\nAlso, fav sushi rolls-- spicy tuna crunch, love affair, full moon. They are all spectacular.\nTheir ice cream parfait dessert is also fantastic. All you can eat is great but doesn't include jalape\u00f1o poppers so I don't usually get it unless I'm in the mood for a big variety. I also love their egg rolls. Before I came here I HATED sushi! And seafood. Now I LOVE sushi, mainly only there's. basically everything is amazing here. I don't like how loud the music is, but if you ask they'll turn it down. Waiters are nice & atmosphere is very japanese (which I LOVE, love Japan & their culture!)"
"I was disappointed to see the prior Yelp page removed - why? because it was accurate? This place (when it was at its prior location way back when) used to be cool, when there was a sense of community. They had flyers, local periodicals. Not anymore. And, not only that, they do readings directly in front of the tarot deck cabinet - l literally have to walk around the table to get to the tarot cards - so, I'm minding my own business looking for a deck, and I have to hear someone's personal stuff like. Um...hello? Isn't that a little bit unethical? \""For entertainment value\"" is one thing, but would you YouTube your appointments with your financial adviser or physician for everyone to see? I mean, c'mon...show some *bleep* respect for the people coming in to your store and give them a little privacy. I wouldn't want customers strolling by me if I came in for a reading. It's just tacky. Everything in this review is accurate and can be corroborated, and I'd be glad to re-post the same sentiment if the store tries to whitewash their Yelp page again. Namaste."
"I was a vegetarian for thirteen years of my life and I think I would have died if this was in my hometown.  \n\nThe ultra-fresh options-a-plenty menu is a huge draw for many people, along with the ridiculously rich and delicious signature red velvet cake they feature, (along with other scrumptious similar mini cakes), but for me it's the service and attention to details that pushed them up to five stars.  \n\nRVC is located very West on Sahara - A little out of the way, but it's worth the drive for me.  The staff has been there for some time, meaning that not only are they loyal but happy there, well treated by the owner, and obviously enjoy the food as well.  :)\n\nOn first visit about two years ago, I had a Chicken and Spinach Wrap which had a generous amount of artichoke hearts, hot cuts of chicken with just the right amount of mozzarella and pesto, (which can be overwhelming.)\n\nThe Chicken, Avocado, and Oil pasta dish I had was out of this world.  It was highly recommended to me by a server and I'm so glad I did because I had to force myself to eat it as slowly as I could.\n\nThe owner really put a lot of thought and work into every ingredient that goes into each recipe, the Zen red decor that seamlessly works in the cafe and dining theme (and even into the bathrooms!), and the people who work for her.\n\nThe detail that pushed my rating from four to five was the fact that there was a solid 9 months between my initial visit and to my second visit and the waiter, (Alex!), remembered me and was very personable and made it a great experience from start to finish."
"Last winter I was in between gyms so thought I'd check capital out. It wasn't too out of the way, had it's own parking, and they had a deal going for a cheap 2 month membership. I did not renew that membership. \n\nThe good: \nEven though they are downtown, they do have parking. It's free early in the morning and later at night. Since I tended to go in the morning around 530-6am, it was nice to have a free covered space to park. \n\nIn the mornings when I went there were always plenty of cardio machines available. \n\nThe downstairs weight lifting area had plenty of weights, squat rack, and even some nice heavier kettlebell pairs to use. And you got to check out the shoes of morning commuters walking past the windows. \n\nMost classes are included in your membership. I tried several different ones. The most interesting was the Trek class which was a guided running (or walking if needed) workout on treadmills. It definitely made indoor winter running easier. \n\nThe bad: \nThey frequently have online specials on their website, but the front desk staff seemed pretty clueless about them. No one gave me a tour or explained how anything was set up. I had to wander around myself to find stuff. The gym is spread over 4 floors, so it can be a bit confusing. \n\nNo one explained how their class systems work. You have to get a pass for the yoga from the front desk, sign up, and then give the pass to the instructor. I had no clue about any of this and the desk workers and class instructors did nothing to help an unfamiliar face figure things out. \n\nThey cancel classes quite frequently. I've liked them on facebook and nearly daily there is some notice about upcoming classes being cancelled. Sometimes the notification is on the day of which would suck if you were planning on attending that class in a hour. \n\nOnce I had figured the yoga classes out, I took a couple of them and they went ok. I'm not great at yoga (tightest hamstrings and glutes in the world? this girl), but I have taken many classes before at different gyms and yoga studies. I didn't go to any advanced classes here, but only those labeled as good for beginners. They had one morning class that was supposed to be gentle, easy, wake up and be refreshed class. The first two times I took it, I felt great afterwards. No pretzel-like poses, just nice opening things up for the day. The third time I took the class there was a different teacher. I don't recall what the guys name was, but I don't think he read the description for the class he was teaching. It was much more intense flow with advanced poses. Several of the students weren't able to even get into the poses, but he gave no alternatives at all. The longer the class went on, the more frustrated I got. When there are only 8 people in the class and 4 of them can't do something for the past 5 minutes of poses and are just standing there, maybe you should switch things up or give alternatives or something. As the class went on I became more and more frustrated. When you are planning on a relaxing morning and then have this thrown at you, it kinda ruins your morning. For the first time in my life, I rolled up my mat and left after about 40 min of the hour long class. I went to the weight room and lifted heavy weights to burn off my frustration. Just thinking about that class is getting me annoyed right now. Ugh."
Brought my family (group of 9) here for a nice dinner on the patio- great idea! They can accommodate large groups and there is plenty of beer to go around! The atmosphere is true to what you would find over in Germany- loud and boisterous! If you're not into loud music and chanting- sit on the patio- you'll be glad you did! The view is spectacular! \nThe food was also nice- ordered schnitzel sandwich and potato pancakes.
"I've concluded that KJ Dim Sum still holds the throne for the best dim sum. I mean, don't get me wrong, there were some items from Chang's that were legit and done very well, but there were more fails than wins. \n\nMy favorites:\n- Shrimp har gow (shrimp dumplings) - this was amazing the first round, delicate and lightly sweet, but the second round was lacking a lot of flavor and not as tender. \n- Cheong Fun (Rice Noodle Rolls) with Shrimp - lovely pillowy soft noodle texture, but 2 miniature shrimps in each roll.  \n- Fried Shrimp Balls served with sweet mayo - this was our favorite, the shrimp balls were super moist inside and flavorful.\n\nI'll pass:\n- Pork Sui Mai - This classic was shamefully bland and unmemorable.\n- Steamed BBQ Pork Buns - they were on the mushy soggy end. The minimal BBQ pork filling wasn't bad, but it's also not the best either. \n- Chicken Feet - good flavor, but fatty and I couldn't get past how oily it was.\n- Fried Taro Puffs stuffed with pork - It had a nice pillowy taro texture, but it was extra soggy on the bottom from being soaked in oil.\n\nWe came here on a Sunday at about 3pm and even though they advertised that Dim Sum is served all day, we were having a difficult time ordering it. Only one lady came out with a cart when we sat down. After we grabbed a couple items from her cart, they all bounced and started their lunch - so no one served us for the rest of our meal. There were no carts to be seen. We wanted to order more, but no one came to check on us.\n\nWe finally got the manager to serve us since he was the only one not on his lunch break. He seemed a little agitated that we wanted to order more. Not to mention, they ran out of a couple items that we wanted to order.\n\nPro Tip: come during prime breakfast and brunch hours- any time after that the service and food will be nonexistent. \n\nThe restaurant didn't give off a clean vibe. The bathrooms are super sketchy, old, sticky, and scary. It makes me wonder what's the condition of the kitchen.\n\nAll of this made it a less than desirable dining experience. We will continue to enjoy the excellent service, pristine cleanliness, better prices, better selection at KJ Dim Sum. Plus KJ has the best egg custard tarts of my entire life! They're damn good."
"Stayed at the MGM Thursday-Saturday, the 6th-8th of October 2011. I have mixed feelings on our stay here so here's my breakdown:\n\nPros:\n- Decent price up front.\n- Close to the airport.\n- Maid service always did a great job.\n- Employees were helpful checking in and out.\n- Multiple GORGEOUS pools with many bars outside.\n- Loved having the huge variety of restaurants available in the hotel, from McDonald's to Craftsteak, multiple Starbucks and everything in between. \n\nCons:\n- Had to pay a mandatory fee per day when checking in for, Wi-fi, phone calls, and a newspaper to delivered to your door daily (which we NEVER received). \n- Had a TV in our bathroom area, it did not work.\n- Had a leak from our shower in to the bathroom area.\n- Ironing board was broken.\n\nIs the MGM great as a whole? Yes. Was our specific room great? No... I was pretty disappointed in our stay here with the few problems we had. Did it inhibit us from having an amazing time? No, but being on vacation I'd hope to have everything go smoothly and error free."
"I'm a Fan!! \nThe first morning that we were in LV, we came in for Breakfast. I had the 8oz steak and sunnyside Eggs with hashbrowns. It was DELICIOUS!! The service was friendly, and quick. \n\nWe came on Friday 8/15 for the AYCE Crab Legs. The wait was about 30-45 minutes (which was not a problem being a Friday night in Vegas), and there is so much commotion and noise (OH, but SO worth it for $19.99). \n\n**** Can I suggest a quick weekly STAFF MEETING to organize the chaos to be expected on a Friday night AYCE Crab legs meal??  It really was sheer chaos. We had several different waiters take our order, bring our order, refill our cups, etc.. I was confused on who the hell to tip @ the end of the night so We ended up leaving the $$ on the table, and let them fend for themselves.  \n\nUpon my next return to LV, I will be visiting Marilyn's again"
"Exactly what Mesa needed!  It was a very nice surprise to find this gem in N/E Mesa!  Usually when we were looking for a fine dining experience in a stylish, modern, elegant setting, we...as a lot of people would look to Scottsdale.  I had read about Cafe Boa Bistro in an article \""Phoenix's Best New Restaurants\"", and was interested in trying it, not only for its close proximity to my home, but because they support our local economy by using mostly local ingredients...I love that!  So we decided to try it, and fell in love!  Everything we ordered was done to perfection!  Quality, presentation, quantity, and atmosphere...this place has it all!  We went earlier in the evening with our daughter, then after dinner, we dropped her off at the sitters and returned for drinks at the bar.  Its a great place if you are looking for a modern twist of sophistication, without having to deal with the Scottsdale scene, crowds, and attitude.  The food is amazing and not you typical Mesa chain Italian restaurant!  Again, this is a place with a modern flair, and the food reflects that as well...so come expecting a new experience in Italian cuisine!"
"For a place that just opens pre-made packages and plops them on a salad-bar, I would think that this effort might not have been to challenging. Perhaps I had my hopes up too high.\n\nI went here for a quick bite as I had business in the neighborhood. I must say, I would have done better anywhere else. The salad selection was less than fresh to say the least. A person kept barging out of the back to refill things, and was super surley. Just get in her way and get an elbow.\n\nAfter the salad selection are random canned things. I guess those were ok. I am not sure.\n\nThey also have a \""hot bar\"". This is where things get really depressing. They had a kind-of taco set-up thing going with what appeared to be ground beef. Except it wasn't! It was straight-up textured vegetable protein! Who even does that? I got a baked sweet potato, and that thing had been sitting under a heat lamp for what seemed weeks and was inedible. The soups were just blah. Who serves french onion soup without the topping? The pizzas they had on the platter were less than what you would expect from the cheapest of frozen pizzas.\n\nJust all in all horrible. I left having drank and unsweetened ice tea and left a plate from the all-you-can-eat salad bar totally full.\n\nWhat a waste of time and money. This place is gross."
"The best!  They've worked out all the kinks that were present in the first weeks they opened....back to great food, great service.  The sparkling sangria is a MUST."
"Having never eaten here and seeing the most recent review was less than stellar, I was hesitant.  In fact we weren't going to order at all.  But I didn't want to leave the house and we wanted Thai and, and, and...so we took a chance.\n\nPad Thai, Pumpkin Curry, Fresh Rolls (summer rolls) and crab rangoons for the kid.  All were EXCELLENT.   The pumpkin curry was ordered spicy and it was perfect,  the summer rolls were really fresh and tasty.  There was a ton of food  it was only me and my 16 year old son -- but he eats every meal as if it is his first and last.  There are still enough to eat today for another mean.  It was around $40 for all of it, which is a fair price.\n\nI don't know why e last person had a bad experience, maybe we got lucky.  But I would definitely order from here the next time I'm visiting the burgh."
"Most forgetful server ever! It must have been his first night ever.... he forgot the extra plate, the extra side, chips n salsa, and most bothersome....... our drinks!!!!!! We were eating our meals and our drinks had still not arrived. And our food was spicy so we were in dire need of a drink.... then at the end he brings the bill and forgets to add the coupon we already gave him."
"Their standard excuse for everything.....we are undergoing renovation.  When it comes to having no working light switch in your room and the over head towel bar falling on your head in the shower that is NO EXCUSE.  These rooms should not even be rented out.   (Especially at $100 and $190 a night) In addition, there was no available hotel parking for hotel guests (not even valet parking) and the bell hop that was supposed to help us with our luggage (before driving the car  to Ballys to park) never showed up.  Try asking to speak to a hotel manager......after 10 minutes they are still on the phone (probably avoiding speaking to angry hotel guests)."
"My wife and I stayed here for a few days while in town on business.We had a suite overlooking the central courtyard at the back.Turns out that's where the delivery trucks do their deliveries and for 3 days in a row at some unGodly hour 2 tour buses were loading up Japanese tourists.My God what a racket !There is nothing in the suites as far as utensils....not a spoon,not even a bloody bottle opener.And then there was the clincher...must be why the place was pretty full.From 5.30pm to 7.30pm every day its happy hour in the large breakfast room with free cocktails and light beer.Every man and his dog was there...mostly quite elderly people getting medicated for the evening.It was pretty funny really.My wife and I were down there shooting some pool and the place was packed with oldies walking around with little plastic cups of cocktails or light beer.It's like a nursing home on steroids."
"I really like Southwest Airlines.  While not fancy, they do exactly what they are supposed to do -  get you where you are going safely and efficiently - with your luggage!\n\n- Great customer service as well as friendly staff and crew\n\n- Inexpensive flights with frequent time slots to choose from, as well as super easy online check-in\n\n- No charge for two - count 'em TWO checked bags.  Yep, I can shop as much as I want at my destination and still drag it all home\n\n- OK, parents will not like me for this one - families with children are not given priority boarding before everyone, but are slotted between the A and B boarding groups.  There are still plenty of seats to be had for you large family types, but those of us without children are not penalized. \n\n- Wise-cracking flight attendants.  My favorite was on a flight to Vegas.  When it was time to collect the service items prior to landing the attendant on the speaker said \""OK people, pass all your cups and glasses to the aisle - we are not going to fly around all day so you can drink\""  Hahaha!"
"I most certainly love Five Guys Burgers & Fries! Dude, even their hot dogs rock!"
"The EXPERIENCE here, as far as service goes is absolutely top notch! Susanne helped my sister and I both find cars that were perfect for us without any of the haggle and hustle at the other dealerships. If you are going to purchase, I highly recommend seeing her. She's knowledgeable and clearly experienced in what she does with a no-nonsense approach, while still being very personable and easy to get along with. She's a breath of fresh air after all of the other dealers I had been working with! Dare I say she made my vehicle purchase fun? I do, I dare to say so. She. Is. Fantastic!\n\nThey have a decent selection here at Carmax, and you can download their app which is really easy to use to help you find cars that are out of state that can be transferred in, either for free, or for a fee, but it's all stated upfront on the website/app. They also offer extended warranties here for a very fair price, and if you take them into the Carmax service station, you get a discount on your co-pay. \n\nThe service station, however, seems to always be very busy, and it can be difficult to schedule an appointment. Even when you get through to schedule (or they call you back) the wait times to bring your car in can be long- so plan ahead if you can. I usually have to schedule about two weeks out when I call.\n\nThe time is took to actually purchase my car once I found it was ridiculously low. I mean, I was in and out of there in less than two hours I think, once we sat down to do the paperwork. It was very fast, very straight forward, absolutely painless.\n\nThe only downside (which is also a plus) is that at Carmax, you don't haggle. The sticker price is the actual price. So while their prices are *fair* you're never going to get a good deal here. You'll pay a fair price, but you also won't be ripped off ever."
Didn't get a chance to eat just had a couple drinks l.. really cool laid back feel. I think the whole design and the lighting. Service was really good. Will come back soon to check out the food.
"GO FOR THE DRINKS, NOT THE FOOD!!!\n\nMy two girlfriends and I went in for a quick bite to re-energize for the long night of partying that was ahead of us, but we all felt so sick to our stomachs after eating our meals that we barely made it out that night. NOT my idea of a good time. It was awful, and I called to let the manager know that we were very unsatisfied with our meals (it was expensive!) but the manager never returned my call. I think that upset me the most.  \n\nNow, we're college girls. We are NOT picky about food. My Cheeseburger In Paradise looked like a Quarter Pounder from McDonalds, which would have been fine if it had tasted as good as a Quarter Pounder.  It was gross. I ate less than half of it and had to stop because I was already feeling sick.  Very disappointing. And my friend couldn't swallow more than four bites of her taco salad.  At least the drinks were good. \n\nMargaritas = good. Everything else = rip off."
"I had to give 1 start because I couldn't give a ZERO. This place is a scam. Breezy has poor customer service she'll hang up on you and show you no respect. I bought a groupon through her and booked the appointment in advance she waited for it to pass didn't call me or text me at all not even \""As she was waiting and waiting for two hours\"" and now wants to charge me DOUBLE (as in $97) to make an appointment. Do not waste your time!"
"Go and get your drink on, they got a cute view thing going on outside, the bar feels small and quaint although it is in the nexus of several of the top restaurants at the Wynn.  The Acai Kiwi drink is packed with vitamin C, so keep telling yourself you are doing yourself a favor and you are not downing more booze.  This place sure has attitude, if you have a need to have a fancy cocktail, which we all do about once a day than take the parasol down and have a drink."
I ordered the spicy shrimp whichis noted as very spicy.  It was so NOT spicy and NOT flavorful.  However I had a nice time inspite of the food.....
"This place suceeds in spite of itself. \n\nIt has a great location, and an appealing look. I wish I could say the same about the food. I agree with Jamie P's review; the food is not quality. \n\nIf you're in the mood for this type of food, and don't feel like driving 90 miles to the nearest Chic Fil A, then settle for Raising Caine. You'll at least get hot food, quality fries, and a friendly attitude. \n\nI am done with this; one and out."
"we were looking for mexican food in our trip to vegas until we found this place.........\n\nwe tried the carne asada tacos and were great, but we came back the next day and ordered a shrimp cocktail and it was THE BEST shrimp cocktail EVER.\n\nI have tried a lot of places for a good sea food cocktail but none compare to this one, all natural shrimp and octopus (optional) lots of avocado and the hand made tortilla chips were hecka good...... and dont even bother to order the small size cup, go for the large size if you really like sea food,\n\nour kids ordered the quesadilla and the torta and were excellent as well,\nthe place is clean and prices are decent.\n\nthe only reason for the 4 stars is the lack of fresh salsa bar and tortilla chips provided to costumers when waiting for the order. Almost forgot,..... they could inprove the fish ceviche tostadas........... \n\noverall the place is worth the traveling from the strip (like 10 mins) and the money......"
"So we had heard about this place from the pizza book and we show up and I kid you not the place is the size of my shed and there is a line out the door and around the front of the building..... just to get your name listed. We finally wait in a 40 min. line and get to the front where the snotty little bitch, rolls her eyes and musters up with - It's a 6.5 hour wait. So your table will be ready at 10:30pm. WTF?\nSo you're telling me i'd get faster service and better pizza if I boarded a plane for Manhattan and even get to eat my favorite pizza -BEFORE this place can seat me?\nSeriously I am not sure if this man is a fucken retard or a a genius?\n\nGet TWO sheds !!!! You had SOOO much money walk away that night and I am sure it happens night after night... But no then there are the idiot hipsters and yuppies who insist on waiting around, getting drunk and spending money at the bar......... \""oh the bar\"" ... you say.\nYES, the bar is often the place restaurants make the most profit. So perhaps he is a genius, because the place was packed there as well. \n\nTreat them like shit, tell them no and to go away and wait at the bar for 6.5 hours and see how hungry and drunk you will be at 10:30pm\n\nI know what you're saying italiano.\n\nOh and with only ONE bathroom for both men and women.... don't expect the line for the potty to be any shorter.\n\nYES WE LEFT!!"
"DONT GO THERE!!!!!!!!! IF YOU ARE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE OR JUST A HUMAN BEING YOU WONT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT! JUST READ........\n\nMy family and I recently went to go eat at Sushi Eye on Warner Road and the I-10. I had purchased an amazon deal and it was set to expire that night so we had to use it. We were there during happy hour so we asked waitress if we could order off the happy hour menu with her knowing full well that we had the coupon. So we did. About 5 minutes later and when we received a couple of the items both the young waitress and owner/manager came to our table and said that we cannot use our  coupon and get happy   hour both. And we explained very nicely to the owner (Richard) that our waitress said that was okay. He said that it was her fault and she should have know better and that SHE CAN PAY FOR THE DIFFERENCE.. My husband and I were floored!.  We asked if we could eat off the happy hour that day and then come back within the month. He wouldnt even do that. He said that we could come back the next day ONLY. He was going to make his employee pay out of their own pocket we couldnt believe it!\n\nThe food isnt even that special.  I would rather go down the road to Ra! \n\nRichard,shame on you for even mentioning that the waitress can pay the difference. I am telling everyone I know so all of Ahwatukee is banning your place of business. I feel sorry for the people that have to work for you!!!!!!\n\nI WOULD NOT GIVE THEM A STAR BUT YELP MADE ME IN ORDER TO POST!!!!!"
"Delicious sub!! I love how the turkey is shredded.  Tasty dressing on the sandwich gave it great flavor.  My only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry  because there was so much.  If the dressing had been on the meat, it would have been perfect.  WAY better than Subway :)"
Tasty... Odd ambiance of 50s diner with mediocre service but good food... I'd come again
"Good breakfast burritos, all other food looks good too"
The bartending staff at Irish wolfhound is always working hard to make sure everyone feels welcome. especially after a long day at my restaurant it feels nice to come in and be recognized because they always know our names and what we usually drink it feels like our version of cheers. Dirty bird forever! !!!!
"If you have been to Disney or even Chi-fil-a this place will disappoint you with their horrible customer service. Perhaps when 80% of your staff are 18 yrs and younger you need to instill respect, courtesy and the customer is always right b/c they just dropped a freakin mini fortune on this crappy amusement park that post hours of operations for stores and restaurants as suggested times. And you only get 1 star because I couldn't leave it blank"
My sister and I took my mom out for her birthday.   They changed their menu  not happy about the new menu.   We had asked our server to do something special for her birthday and never did.  The service was not great either.
"I want to give Lisa a shout out on here too! Most of the reviews on here seem to be for AJ which I believe is Lisa's daughter. But Lisa was my stylist and I had a great experience :)\n\nI saw the reviews on yelp and decided to try this place out yesterday. I called in and they were able to get me in same day. \n\nThe salon is located in an adorable, charming house. I loved that it was unique and inviting! I'm sick of trendy places that focus more on the look of the place rather than the quality of the service. At The Roose, quality is most important!\n\nI originally only wanted a bang trim because I am trying to grow my hair out after a couple very short cuts (and because I'm broke but don't want to look like a slob!). Lisa took a look at my hair and decided that a full trim was in order. I agreed because I definitely didn't want to look like a crazy person! \n\nLisa was very nice, listened to what I wanted, and is very talented! I highly recommend her! \n\nI also want to thank her for being so kind with the \""special\"" she gave me. That is TRUE human kindness. She most definitely has wonderful karma coming to her. :)"
"Dualing Piani....er, pianos! Need I say more? Not to busy early in the week but standing room only on weekends! Good drinks, no food, and the perfect place to go with a crowd. Get there early though, or your crowd will be standing most of the night."
"Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free."
"For some reason, the pump wouldn't take my Visa card. It beckoned me to, \""please see cashier.\"" Fortunately, I had hours to spare and was delighted to spend my afternoon with the Shellmart cashier, which is precisely why I pulled into a station with automatic electronic pumps. Alas,  the pump subsequently decided to accept a MasterCard, which prevented me from journeying inside to sample Shell's stale generic-brand Twinkies."
"A well deserved 5 star restaurant. Cheap and authentic. Fresh pulled noodles everyday. Fast service, lots of space and clean environment."
"awesome lanes, always busy, always clean... I think the cashier could be happier but hey, its a bowling alley."
"Walking past the charming courtyard, I was rather dissapointed with the inside interior.  It was valentine's Day and they had obviously packed more tables into the main dining area to crank out more $$.  The result was table's placed in odd configurations and ours half blocked a doorway.  We also had to listen to everyone's conversation because they were way too close.  \n\nThe food was not exciting, but we were ordering off a limited holiday menu.  I would be curious to know what type of experience we would have had if it had been an ordinary weekend."

"Don't really know what they really mean by Nam but it's definitely not a Vietnamese restaurant. The name is quite misleading.\n\nThe pho is below average but i guess ppl just simple dont have an option in Madison though. If you want to have decent pho/vietnamese foods, you have to go all the way to the west side for saigon noodles. Madison sucks"
"We started with Four Cheese Flat bread ($12). The cheesy mix of fontina, provolone, mozzarella, and parmesan was a great gooey blend, but the sauce and crust were weak links. The sauce lacked any zip and I prefer a chewier crust. This one was a bit dry and crisp. \n\nWe shared two entrees: first was Baja Fish Tacos ($16). The mahi mahi pieces were dry, I wasn't a fan. Second was a Beef Gyro Wrap ($14). It was a bit bland and calling it a gyro was a stretch. I suppose I'm too used to savory mix of spices, beef and lamb in a traditional gyro. The fries looked crunchy, but they were mushy. I like crisp fries. The side salad with mixed greens and feta was great, though. \nWe left Sedona unimpressed."
"I really wish that I had gotten a larger size of the tortellini salad, it was super.  And the key lime dessert was ridiculously wonderful....mellow, not too tart but not too sweet.   I also wish that I had gotten the apricot pork tenderloin, it looked great.  My daughter did love her two cookies :-)  This is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!!!!"
It was ok. It is like someone who is drunk and this is what the craved for munchies. They combined a Panda Express with a Taco Bell into one dish. Also the fried rice was terrible
"I could not find a place to park my Honda Civic and enjoy the trails.  After about 60 minutes of looking.  I gave up.  Need more options to get there, and where to park the car so that the trail can actually be enjoyed.  I will save my time and go elsewhere.\n\nSuggestion:  Should consider developing an offsite parking area, and providing a shuttle to the entrance (perhaps for a small fee)...and let it be known where to find the shuttle."
"wonderful sammiches~\n\nburned my tongue but at least I wasnt hungry anymore\n\nwhat did I eat? I dont really remember...all I know is that there was chicken and cheese and red bell peppers.\n\nseats were a bit to strange to sit in, and I like the fact how it was actually pretty quiet, away from the hustle bustle of Vegas. Luckily there was no line.\n\nSo Service was nice, with smiles and pretty quick with the food"
"I'm a huge fan of the Venetian/Palazzo hotels.  They're the only places I'll stay when I go to Vegas.\n\nROOMS:  They're huge!  All the rooms here are suites.  We stayed in the Bella Suite which is about 700 sq ft.  There are THREE flat panel TV's (living rooms, bedroom, and bathroom).  The bedding is comfy.  The bathroom has his/hers sinks, a tub, a shower, and a separated bathroom stall.  The living room has an L-shaped couch that pulls out into a queen size bed.  There's also a round table and a small office area.  \n\nAMENITIES:  The pool area is shared with the Venetian so there are many pools, whirlpools, and cabanas to choose from.  The casino area is kinda small, but it's a short walk to the Venetian, which has a larger casino space.  There are so many shops and restaurants!\n\nI'm a big fan of this hotel, and like I said before, Palazzo and Venetian are my go-to hotels in Vegas!"
"Probably the worst chipotle location I have ever been to. I'm a big fan of chipotle don't get me wrong but this location is awful.\n\nThe service is slow, the staff aren't very attentive, and the girl that made my burrito was useless. As soon as I started to open the foil wrap the burrito started falling apart. In the end it's really not that big of a deal but if I wanted a burrito bowl I would have ordered one.\n\nProbably the worst part about this location is the wait time to get your food. The dining area is never all that busy but the line is always at least 15 to 20 mins long. The staff just move slowly plain and simple. \n\nI will continue to enjoy chipotle, but I don't think I will be returning to this location again, not worth it."
"bloody mary, Amir, 70 degrees, Kona and v-land!!!! Perfect!! Great happy hour selection, beautiful outdoor venue, great drinks, delish Pad Tai !!!"
"We went here accidentally because we didn't know where to eat since we tried to go to Lillie's Asian Cuisine but it was closed for lunch and we went to go to Market Street Cafe to try their famous oxtail soup but the oxtail soup was not available until 11 pm. So we decided to go to Grotto, boy we were glad we came here. \nWe ordered: \n- fried calamari comes with their yummiest tomato sauce (i never like tomato sauce but this one is so delicious i ate it clean), the calamari was dry not oily like other restaurant.. very good.\n- lobster bisque ... very good. the best lobster bisque beside the one i tried at the four seasons hotel san francisco. They gave a good chunk of lobster meat.. so delicious. Just don't order it to go because i liked it so much i ordered it to go and they didn't give the lobster meat at all.. so disappointed.\n- chicken alfredo linguine.. good, the white chicken meat is good but it is not grilled like what i expected, i think it was sliced roasted chicken but the overall is good because it is not greasy not too much butter and i didn't feel bloated after that.\n\nTheir bread was good, served warm and so yummy, one of the best bread but you have to ask because they won't give out the bread unless you ask for it.\n\nThe only thing that was off: the food took a while to get out, we had to wait for each of the food to get out and the restaurant was not even crowded."

"When I am looking for fast, cheap, good Hawaiian eats in Vegas, I stop here.  Love the marination that they use on their meats.  Great malasadas too!"
"Macaroons are great, the one I had today was a little over filled but still great flavor! I was however extremely disappointed... I ordered the Greek Caesar with chicken - the chicken add was 2.95 for deli slices chicken. The atmosphere has a great feel but they need to turn the a/c on..."
"Are you kidding me?? I bought a Las Vegas Beach Towel 13 hours ago at the Charleston store. Got it back to hotel noticed it had a hole in it and the edging was coming apart. I was heading to the airport so I took my receipt and towel to this location.  I was told it wasn't in their system because it was seasonal they could not refund or exchange it (I wanted an exchange).... I said I bought it 13 hours ago at  a Wal Mart, you are a corporation.  She said well you didn't buy it at this store you have to take to the store you bought it at?!?!? WHAT???"
"My mouth was watering at the thought of tasting Thomas Keller's cuisine for weeks before I visited Vegas.  While it was tasty, I consider anything under 5 stars for Keller to be a disapointment.\n\nThe servers were friendly, helpful and accommodating, funny and personable without being overbearing.  They offered tastes of drinks and were happy to describe anything on the menu in vivid detail.  These were our dishes, and my thoughts.\n\n1.  Oysters:  These were from New Brunswick, and they were good.  I've had good oysters and bad ones, and these were among the best.  But that's to be expected.\n\n2.  Terrine de foie gras:  This was rich.  Very rich.  It was a struggle to finish, which is not how I've ever felt eating foie.  I also prefer a seared piece of liver, rather than the terrine.  It was a little salty.\n\n3.  Cheese plate:  We ate 6 cheeses, and 3 of them were fantastic.  The others were average for a restaurant of such caliber.  I'll give them this one.  It was a great selection.\n\nAppetizers were good.  If the meal had stopped here, I may have leaned toward five stars.\n\n4.  Steak Frites:  This was run of the mill.  The pommes frites were tasty, but the cut of steak was tougher and less flavorful than I had hoped.  I wouldn't recommend this entree.\n\n5.  Roasted chicken:  It was moist and well cooked, but seasoned too heavily.\n\n6.  Pan seared skate:  This was my first time trying this dish, and it may be the ingredients rather than the cooking, but I was thoroughly unimpressed.  It was tough, dry, and way too salty.  I don't usually leave dishes unfinished, but this was one.\n\n7.  Lamb:  This was the best item I ate that evening.  It was moist, flavorful and accompanied by a delicious sauce.  I'd recommend this to diners at Bouchon.\n\nAs I said earlier, it wasn't a bad meal.  I just had such high expectations, and I was let down.  It was not the best meal I had during my two-day visit to Las Vegas.  Not bad, but proceed with caution, especially for Keller fanatics."
Besides having a Starbucks in here this is one of the best places to stop and get a peace of mind away from the hustle and bustle
"I'm maybe I'm missing something here because I found the place to be really underwhelming. The service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was . . . eh. I kept getting a 'chemical taste' off of the food and I'm not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing, I got the brisket tacos and they ended up being 1) kind of chemical artificial tasting and 2) watery from the salsa. Not really a good combination. Maybe I chose poorly but I wasn't impressed at all."
"dim sum yay!   Haven't had anything from the regular menu here but the dim sum lunch was just like back home in the bay area!  $30 for 2 people, and we were stuffed, the carts just kept on coming! **it gets a little crowded and it's in the middle of the casino, but if it's cheap and the food is good...I'm all for it and besides...it's Vegas baby!!"
"Vegas Computer Doctor ROCKS!  They fixed an iMac that, without a doubt, would have had to been 'junked' had it been taken to a dealer. Thank goodness I found Vegas Computer Doctor...Armando's patience and calm helped me get back a great machine...and avoid a lot of $$$.  They're trustworthy and reliable."
"It's hard to find authentic Italian food in Phoenix. But here's a little gem. We even overheard the owner speaking in Italian to an older gentleman at the bar.\n\nWe liked the classy touch of tablecloths and cloth napkins but don't be afraid  to wear your favorite jeans. The atmosphere is comfy and casual with a touch of class. Very nice mix. Only about 20 tables so  you won't get lost in the crowd.\n\nWe were waited on hand and foot by a very attentive, friendly server. My drink never went empty. We were always asked how everything was. \n\nWe shared an antipasto which was brimming with nice little ingredients. Field greens were more impressive than iceberg lettuce. The house Italian dressing was delish.\n\nFor the main course I had the chicken parm which was out of this world. Their sauce had that homemade taste you can't get anywhere. My wife had the Shrimp Orecchiette. She said it was dry but Idon't know how that is supposed to be since I never heard of it. Thats why I stick to the basics.\nThe Portions were large and we were full. Overall, it looks like they take pride in hand-preparing your meal.\n\nFor dessert: Cannoli. Well presented on a big dish with chocolate sauce drizzled over and a hint of lemon in the light filling. And only $3.50. Nice finish. \n\nOh. And they will box up your leftovers for you. You don't see that much anymore except the high end places."
"I think if you enjoy staying or frequently visiting the Palms, you are probably someone that looks like the people featured here at this site: http://www.hotchickswithdouchebags.com/\n\nI only stayed here because I had plans to see a show at The Pearl that night. My room was the basic, low budget one, and I can't believe they sell this thing at around $200 a night. The TV isn't even a flatscreen one- I could get a cheap room with a better TV at Excalibur. The only thing good about that room was the bed that had lots of soft pillows on it.\n\nThe casino floor isn't very big. I think most of the Palms' main building is for their clubs, some of which happen to be inconveniently near the hotel room elevators, making it difficult to get to your room since you have to squeeze by nasty, Ed Hardy wearing douchebags and drunk girls wearing dresses that would've fit them 20lbs ago. It seems like this hotel was made for just the \""bros\"" because every time I walked into the elevator, what would come out was some ugly sparkly-shirt wearing, uber tanned, spikey haired guy. Yuck. Oh and they have AXE deodorant spray in the rooms too. \n\nFood selection was lame, and the waiters at the 24/7 Cafe need to be more attentive. I left after waiting for over 20 minutes to be served. \n\nThe only good thing I have to say about this place is that most of the staff is really nice. The reception and concierge desk were helpful, especially with letting me check in to my room at 9:30 AM instead of waiting till 4 PM. Other than that, there's no good reason for me to return to this hotel. I'm sticking to the strip."
"As a frequent subway-go-er, this has been the worst subway i've ever gone to. Normally I feel bad about negatively reviewing a place, but after experiencing negative customer service more than 5 times at that location, i'd say it's safe to let it all out. While this place is conveniently close to my work, I am finding myself avoiding it every day during lunch time. Why? the employees frequently pick on me for the specific instructions I have on my sandwich. It seems as though asking for a little avocado is being noted as \""picky\"". I am constantly picked on each time I go in there with constant \""oh im sorry did you want cheese on this side or that?\"", \""girlfriend make up your mind!\"", and \""laughs\"" because I didn't want that extra high caloried 3rd cookie because it's 3 for a dollar (yes i like 2 and only 2 for the sake of not indulging myself...I think thats quite enough for my dollar thank you). As a customer, you're always supposed to walk out with a smile and experience a positive environment. Do I experience any of those? absolutely not, I find myself constantly muttering a bunch of rants each time I walk out in frustration that I as a customer am being picked on!! Perhaps that's their sense of humor, but they should realize that customer service is not a comedy show, and I don't have time for their silly remarks. Additionally, their \""welcome to subway\"" is not welcome at all, especially when you don't even look at the customer while saying it. They're better off just not saying it all if it is not sincere. I will spend the extra dollar and mile to go to chipotle, thanks."
"I hate to be like this, but Hugo's Cellar was kind of a disappointment.  After all the amazing reviews, we thought it would be a nice, romantic place to eat.  It  was nice and romantic.  The food...well... \n\nLobster bisque was very good.  Then it went downhill.  I ordered my meat medium,  and my husband ordered his rare.  Mine came back extremely rare, while his was literally cold.  Both dishes were sent back. They gave me a whole new steak, which was again, very rare. And instead of truly heating up my husband's steak, they simply placed the entire plate back under the heat lamp. So the plate came back hot, while the steak was still cold.  Just very disappointing for a place that is supposed to specialize in this kind of thing.\n\nMy husband did not want to make a big deal, so he just didn't eat the dish and asked for them not to charge us.  They didn't...so to speak.  They ended up charging us 15 dollars for the salad he ate beforehand.  Come on.  15 dollars.  \n\nAtmosphere was great.  Steak- no way.  Two dishes screwed up? I'd rather not take the chance to try again and just go somehwere tried and true."
Love this theater...I prefer to drive here over Red Rock so much less crowded. \n\nIf only LBS and Yardhouse were here as well ;D
"Slick, lounge style dining in the middle of the bellagio. It's dark, the music is loud, the food is outrageously expensive, Vegas baby!  A pretty creative menu all things considered. U gotta try the hot wing lollipops and scallops. Everything we had illicited rave reviews. Definitely a place for a group on the town..."
"Located inside of Bellagio so of course this is not a jeans and t-shirt place.  It is classy and small.  They do need to do more things to bring more of a crowd in, besides their usual herding of the women with free drinks at night, hoping to draw the men in.  \n\nUsually, when you do go and have a drink there or two, they will give you a free entrance bracelet to the nightclub The Bank.\n\nAll in all, it is a great cozy place to go to, when you want to meet your friends for a drink and chat, before you head out to a loud, noisy bar/club and won't be able to hear what anyone has to say."
I live a block away from this place. I walk by it all the time and it seems to be busy all the. Time. I ate there few times but I'm yet to find a good item on their menu. The food is terrible. It is a beautiful place in terms of design and the staff are always nice but if you want good food don't even bother .
OMG this is seriously my favorite place to eat on mill. I love that you can get a super tasty burrito quickly and hang out and have a drink at the bar. And they are really cheap. I would highly recommend the pork. It's shredded and has a nice kick to it.
"When I booked the Thanksgiving buffet, I did not have high expectations for the food.  I read the Yelp reviews and assumed the food would be acceptable.  Unfortunately, even that expectation was not achieved.\n\nI wanted a place that served a fairly traditional meal (which unfortunately left out most of the fine dining takes on Thanksgiving) without waiting in line at one of the mega buffets.  Other than the Italian cured meats and bread, the food was poor.  The carved turkey and pork were dry and lacked any flavor.  The yams were terrible.  The Italian entr\u00e9es were ok, but nothing special.\n\nIn all, my worst meal in Vegas."
"My family arrived at this strip mall tex-mex at about 7pm on a Friday night.  Seating was quick and the \""joint was jumping\""  Let me start by saying this is THE LOUDEST RESTAURANT I have ever been in.  After the expansion, I guess they like the acoustics, because there was not a shred of fabric anywhere to absorb the sound.\n\nAppetizers and drinks arrived right away and the simply apps were good (guacamole and cheese dip).  Our orders for entrees were taken at 7:15pm and that was where the wheels came off.\n\nMain course finally arrived at around 8pm and my order was flat-out wrong.  Maybe it isn't such a good idea to have two menu items that sound so much alike (Tacos al Carbon and Tacos al Camarone) in a noisy dining room.  Took an additional 10 minutes to get the right entree while everyone else ate.\n\nFood was generally tasty, but the fixings with the Fajitas and Tacos were lean (no cheese and only enough sour cream etc for 1 tortilla).  My son though the Burrito Fritto (Chimichanga) was amazing, though.\n\nWe did not drink for a change, so that certainly may be \""undiscovered country,\"" but all in all it was a disappointing experience.  A place like this is not really intended for a 100-minute dining experience."
"We read so many good reviews on Yelp that we had to try this place. We took the light rail and arrived around 830pm Saturday night. \n\nThe place looked very promising with its modern indoor/outdoor blended setup. It was a full house but not too packed. We waited around 20 minutes for a table which was passed with a round of drinks from the bar. This is where the downhill slide began. A Plum Blossom was ordered from the cocktail menu. It was so sugary, it really was totally undrinkable. The two Kiltlifters ordered came with about an inch and a half to spare to the top, as if someone took some sips on the way from the bar. The glass of house white was barely acceptable. \n\nDuring our wait we had time to study the menu and decided the pumpkin soup and pepper crusted flat iron steaks would be ordered by at least two in our party. Little did we know until seated that they were out of the flat iron steak which left very limited options. \n\nWith pumpkin soup on the way along with a burger, the roasted chicken, and a flatbread, we still had high hopes. \n\nThe pumpkin soup was brought quickly. The plate was burning hot and the soup ice cold with a hardened film covering the top. We would have sent it back but our entrees arrived so soon after there  wasn't time. Apparently they pre-pour and use heat lamps. \n\nThe flat bread was just so so...very dry. The chicken was nothing to write home about. The burger was super well done (ordered medium well) and very dry. The menu states that it comes with a choice of sides but when we asked our waitress she stated that it only comes with fries. \n\nA bottle of Patz&Hall Pinot Noir was ordered for the table. Normally we love Pinot's but this one was awful. It was much too harsh. \n\nBy the end of the meal we had had enough. Dessert was offered but we politely passed. \n\nMaybe we are the sole recipients of a bad meal as the star ratings on here are very high. But in our opinion, Postino's and Maizes have nothing to worry about if this is the best St. Francis can offer. \n\nOn the plus side, there was a very entertaining crowd. The women's  bathroom was occupied by a frolicking couple so all in our party had the opportunity to digest the provocative corral art in the men's room. \n\nNormally this place would deserve nothing better than a single star but it gets two as the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was worth something."
"We were looking for a great place to eat that wasn't a part of the strip, and was relatively cheap but better than Denny's. This place is awesome! Great atmosphere. Tasty breakfast food which is higher quality than any other breakfast place we've been to. Relatively inexpensive prices. \n\nVery impressed and we will definitely be back next time we come to Vegas!"
"Pretty solid Thai food, comparable to Thai food in LA, not too far from the Strip. Other pluses are that its cheap and clean too. \n\nEnjoyed:\n- pad see ew with tofu\n- beef thai salad- note: when they ask how spicy you want it, I would think about what you would really say (on scale of 1-10 with 10 being spiciest) and then take it down 1 of 2. \n\nDefinitely recommend this to anyone looking to escape the Strip, for some normal priced, good tasting Thai food. \n\nAlso, I think there might be drive through? But not sure, as that would be the 1st Thai drive through Ive ever seen! (see pictures)"
"My kids' allergies were really kicking up, so I started looking for someone to clean our air ducts.  I called a highly rated air conditioning business to ask their opinion and they told me their customers were extremely happy with All Ducts.  I called Brian (owner/manager/employee) and he got me an appointment exactly when I needed it.  He gave me an estimate for both cost (very affordable, in my opinion) and time and both were spot on. He has all of the right equipment--he is not a carpet cleaner that is trying to moonlight as a duct cleaner. He is thorough and professional.  I had him clean my dryer vent as well, which was a tricky job, as the builder vented the dryer from the first floor to the roof. However, Brian had the proper equipment and was able to do the job easily. I highly recommend All Ducts."
"Haha, BJ's, now that that's aside...\n\nThe food here is amazing! I came here for lunch with my mom even though I wasn't hungry at all. Their menu is large with something for everyone, even for those like me who come in with a very little appetite. They have a small bites menu consisting of stuffed mushrooms, ahi tuna, and a few other choices for $3. I ordered the ahi tuna that was seared to perfection for being such a small filet and the portion was perfect! My mom ordered the flatbread and salad lunch combo. I couldn't resist trying her flatbread. OMG, the crispy thin crunch of their flatbread...so delicious!\n\nI checked out their beer selection and was pleasantly impressed. I can't wait to come back with an appetite to try more items and beverages off their menu! The hostess greeted us with a smile while she sat another party in front of us and then came back right away and sat us. The server was quick and the food came out fast. The decor was nice, but its still a fun casual restaurant."
Great condo unit....really worth the time spent here...
"We went during lunch time in the middle of the day to beat any rush or big lines. Prices were ok, about $21 a person. The food was very good, obviously the quality is top notch for the price. Im sure they have all the very expensive seafood for dinner so there was toned down menu for lunch. They had great steak fajitas, I ate about 10 of them, their raviolis were awesome too. Soups were average at best and service was decent, they cleared plates pretty quickly. Overall a great meal, but  maybe a bit too expensive for a basic lunch menu, i dunno maybe Im just cheap."
"I just came here for lunch yesterday and it did not disappoint. Their pasta, seafood, and desserts are really good and I got full off of those alone. They do have sushi hand rolls and california rolls but they aren't anything special. I was sold once I had the parisian macaroons for dessert....yummm! The only thing I didn't really like was the kobe beef. It was as rare as it gets which is just not my style. it was so rare that I had to basically saw it to cut it but even then it was too rare to enjoy. I didn't try the other beef cuts but my boyfriend kept going back for seconds so it must've been good. Definitely worth the $20 something dollars per person!"
"7/15/2014 6:30 PM\nParty of three: nice waitress ALLY ask for drink request. I asked for Tomato Juice and beer. NO tomato juice only bottle mixes for alcohol. Ordered Margarita, bottle mix. Pepsi ok. Ordered 20 wings medium. Ok. Ordered salads for three,  Romain, slice of cucumber two slices of tomato hot house. \nChicken fingers fried as one big blob. Popcorn shrimp again fried as blob, but cooked dark brown. Shrimp was frozen along time it was very fishy!\nWaitress and service from her was excellent, but worst food I have eaten twenty years. Please don't go there. Bill was $58.00 plus tip. WOW WHAT A RIP OFF. Manager never visited request."
This airport makes no sense and has gotten to big for its britches.  The gates layout sucks and you can't tell who is coming or going.  It is hot and there are very limited charging stations.  The TSA folks all had their Cheerios peed in and were very rude.  The rental car area while nice is a 20min bus ride.  All in all not a fan for this sometimes necessary evil airport.
Worst zoo I have been to. Not a good zoo if you have a big stroller. There were hills upon hills and it was way more exhausting than fun. There were doors in the kids exhibit that i could barely get my stroller through. \n\nThe playground was awful. Like some tunnels and nets. \n\nSecurity was super nice and helpful though. I had left my headlights on and they notified me :)
"Zero stars,  if I  could give it. This place SUCKS. The waitress shows up to take your order, drop off your food and give you a check. Doesn't stop by to see if you need anything. Place is filthy. Food is terrible. Service horrible.  Will never  return to a Long Wongs restaurant."
"Large portions, the line moves quickly, great outdoor seating where my wild kids can roam free (watch out for them climbing the fence to get to the oh so tempting playground in the middle of traffic), and the food is outstanding.  My favorite is the brisket.  So tender with a touch of crunchiness in just the right places."
"OK, I like food and can be a bit picky about where I spend my money, especially for sushi.  When a friend introduced me to this place a few weeks ago, i was like, \""all  you can eat sushi, really? That doesn't sound very appealing.\""  BUT, I was blown away by the food!  The best calamari tempura I've ever eaten! Very fresh, light, not greasy.  And the agadashi was like fluffy white clouds in my mouth.  The nigiri, especially the white tuna, was awesome:  very fresh, perfect temperature.  And ALL the rolls I had were great.  I highly recommend this place.  It will be my new sushi spot from now on."
"I just visited Little India for the first time! It was great! Initially I thought I was walking into an Indian grocery store, however after seeing the tables in the back and the pictures of food on the walls, I knew I was in the rig place.  I found out that Little India is a vegetarian resturant so, not really knowing what to order I decided to pick a little of everything on the menu to see what I liked.  The modest pricing allowed me to order 9 dishes 2 combo plates and 2 beverages for about $40. Some of my favorites were the Mixed Chatt which was a great combination of strong flavored with a little spiciness.  The Bhindi Masala was an okra dish that went well with the bread served with one of the combos.  The Mango pickle that was on almost every plate was strong and amazingly flavorful, but also quite strong.  I always suggest that people try new things at least once, so give it a shot and see if it works for you.  The lentils with spinach and the Matar Paneer were both very tasty and also went well with the flatbread.  Finally, my favorite was a small dish called Dhokla which was a light and fluffy yellow bread which came with an amazing green dipping sauce; the sweetness of the yellow bread was a great complement to the green dipping sauce.  The only dish that I didn't really care for was the Pani Puri, which was a small hard puffed pastry with a thin dipping sauce that had the taste of raw egg.  If you are a fan of Indian food, a wide array of flavors, and if your low on cash I highly recommend Little India in Tempe (^_^)"
Don't waste your time.  It used to be good.  It's not anymore.
"When you see line ups before the restaurant opens, it's a sign that they are doing something right. Schwartz's is a very small, busy diner with a cult following. My waiter was excellent, giving us great advice as we settled on the combo which came with fries. We ordered the coleslaw and had pickles on the side. If the seating wasn't so crowded and follow diners dropping f-bombs, this establishment would have received 5 stars from me. You should bring cash as they do not accept credit cards."
"Vdara is different from the other hotels in Vegas...it's away from the hustle bustle. There is no casino and no high end shops. That also means it's much quieter, smells clean and getting up to your room is not  an expedition. The pool seemed really nice too but they closed at 4pm (but that's probably because it's late winter/early spring).\nYes, it's away from the strip but conveniently connected to the Bellagio which is right on the strip. Sometimes it was annoying to walk through the Bellagio but for the the most part, it was not a problem at all. Although we didn't try it but there's a tram that connects Aria and Bellagio. \nThe room was modern yet cozy. There were 2 tv screens, automatic shades/blackout curtains, a stove, microwave and a mini fridge with 2 complimentary bottles of water. The bathroom was also pretty nice...especially the soaking bathtub with a hand shower. My only issue was that there were no power outlets on the bedside (or I didn't see any)...I like to have my phone charging next to me as I sleep. Also, perhaps this is standard for Vegas hotels but there was no coffee maker in the room. Otherwise, the hotel room was very comfortable and inviting.\nThe service was exceptional. Every staff member we encountered was courteous and provided the best service they could. The housekeeping staff went out of their way to clean and arrange things appropriately \nWe enjoyed our stay here!"
"How could any Joel Robuchon restaurants disappoint you. Needless to say,  this was my best dining experience ever, from food to service to ambiance,  everything was superb."
"When I sat down I noticed my tiny plate had old wasabi crust on it,but no worries I was politely given another one.Well I liked this place because It is a really convenient area. It's a great place to come  after shopping with your friends. The sushi (I think it was called the Mango roll) I got tasted like salsa. the bento boxes are filling and have authentic Japanese flavor. I have had better sushi compared to this place. The only positive thing about this place is the area."
"Um...Wow!  I don't think they have maid service in this dive of a hotel.  After checking in, I opened the blinds.  Filthy windows with lips, nose and tongue marks from what looked like children who stayed their before me.  Room reeked of something nasty like urine, mold and mildew all mixed together.  Went to use the bathroom and it's a good thing I didn't sit.  The man who stayed there before me had peed all over the seat and nobody bothered to clean it before giving the room to someone new.  \n\nWent back to the lobby to get a new room.  At least the toilet was clean in this one.  But the sink had some dirty stains all over it from the last guest.  And their hairs were still in the shower which was apparently not cleaned.  All of the water cups in the room had holes in them and were unusable.  The bath towels were all different shades of stained dingy white covered in dirt and I had to borrow towels from the friends I was visiting.  Scared of the bed, so I slept with all of my clothes on.  Worst motel I have ever stayed in and definitely way over priced."
"The Grand Lux Cafe is by the same creator of The Cheesecake Factory, but my experience at this location in the Palazzo was better than any Cheesecake Factory that I have been to.  Yum!  \n\nFrom eating at the Wynn Buffet, Lavo, Suger & Ice, to McDonalds, Table 10, and other eating adventures in Vegas, this place was a nice happy medium.  Although the service was a bit slow, the food was noteworthy!  I personally had the sandwich lunch special for about $10 which included half a chicken salad sandwich, soup, and a salad with their amazing ranch dressing.  The bf had steak and shrimp scampi, which was MmMmMm and OMG MmMmMm!  The steak literally melts in your mouth with tender juiciness while the shrimp scampi was breaded with loads of wonderful flavor.  \n\nThumbs up to Grand Lux Cafe!  I shall return! =)"
LV Yelpers... stay away!\n\nCame here the other night for dinner since I was craving fish.\n\nI waited over 30 minutes to be seated.\nCrab soup was horrible... no taste.\nFish wasn't cooked throughly. (I had the trio and rainbow trout)\nlomi salmon wasn't done right.\n\nManagement and customer service was horrible with compensation for bad service.\n\nI won't be back.\n\nNEXT!
"We watched the Restaurant Impossible episode and decided, how many chances do you have to go to a place that's been on a reality TV show?  So off we went...\n\nThe food was actually amazing!  I'm talking lick your plate clean amazing!  Too bad it's so far away."
"The oysters are delicious. Sweet and clean. I recommend to skip on the lobster grilled cheese. It was, as most people stated, bland.  The sourdough bread is yummy and the chips are homemade, but nothing to be excited about. The crab special is a MUST!!! I love that the crabs come already cut and mess free AND it's only $28 for 1 and a half pounds of deliciousness. \n\nOysters Rockefeller was yummy, but I prefer the Louisiana gold seal oysters (raw)  Next time we visit we are ordering the cioppino (the guy next to us ordered and it smelled amazing!!!) Overall a good price for the food. Service was meh, but our bartender made sure he checked up on us all the time. Kitchen staff seemed off getting the food out. All our food (appetizer included) came out at the same time.  The Bloody Mary oyster shooter was ok. Too much vodka for my taste.  The best part is that this place is open til 12am!!! That's awesome. We will for sure be coming back. And more than likely regulars at this place! Dive in. Enjoy!"
"08/23/11 DINNER. \n\nOK. We've given this place 4 chances. I don't think we need to go back.\n\nPROS\n- Pan Roast. A creole concept, supposedly, very rich. I've tried it twice, once mixed (lobster, crab, shrimp) and once just crab. Liked both versions a LOT. Went back for this. But I hear the one at the Palace Station might be better. Will investigate, but NOT in a hurry.\n\nNEUTRAL\n- The \""special\"" raw oysters. Tried the Kusshi and Kumimotos twice, thought they were good. THEN I got Kusshi's at Comme Ca in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas after 10pm for CHEAPER (a dozen at Tides was $20, at Comme Ca $18!) and the quality difference was STUNNING. I'll only get half-shell product at Comme Ca (after 10pm) and BLUEHOUR (happy hour $1 oysters) from now on.\n- Shrimp cocktail. 5 large shrimp. Spouse had it this time, thought it was OK, thought $13 was high considering the $2.99 ones at Grand Cafe within Stations are just as good overall.\n- Gumbo. It was fine, but I preferred the Pan Roast.\n- Wine selection. OK selection, but expensive.\n\nCONS\n- Lobster Roll. Spouse got it this time around, shells throughout. Last bite was filled with shell, had to spit it out. Told the server, she did absolutely nothing. I said \""Well, guess it goes into Yelp!\""\n- Etouffee. Just didn't do it for me. Preferred the Pan Roast.\n- Beer selection. Yeah, they give you 23oz beers for $6, but nothing special.\n- Smoke. Altho it's somewhat enclosed, it's one of two restaurants in GVR that has access to smoke, and it shows. Spouse was sneezing like mad at one point, and said \""It's the smoke\"". (The SUSHI BAR in GVR is MUCH WORSE for smoke. It's really ridiculous, serving sushi next to smokers at slots! Whereas the steak house is ENCLOSED!)\n- Service. All four times, the servers are \""nice\"", some nicer than others (actually, only one in four is nicely memorable). But no water offered, all four times. They take orders, bring food/drink, NO timing involved (if you're in the middle of something, too bad, here comes the next course!), come by once per serving and ask/say  \""EVERYTHING OK? GOOD.\"" and QUICKLY move on. When we were there today there was ONE server for the ENTIRE restaurant, counter AND tables, and I counted 20+ heads to serve. Really impersonal. Guess cuz they want you back on the casino floor ASAP after dining!\n\nI'm just underwhelmed for the expense, EVEN with coupons generated by their WE LOVE LOCALS website.\n\nWe're done."
Hotel and room were fine but I was very disappointed that they wouldn't let the shuttle take us to or pick us at the light rail station. The other hotels in the area had their shuttles running without trouble. Probably won't stay here again.
"i love me some Tuna salad here. came on a friday during Lent so it's pretty much the only place that served anything remotely good for a God fearing Christian like myself. can't beat the $5 footlong anywhere. plus, i can get back to Oshea's beer ponging quick. \n\nobserving Lent in Sin City is pretty much the definition of irony."
worst hotel in vegas\n\nsuck ass!!!
I love going to this location because it's on my way back to Arizona and the staff is always friendly. Never had an issue with an order at this one. They never rush you. I like mine a special way and most get it right
"The wait after you order is pretty bad. It took over an hour to get out main course at lunch. Big waste of time. Can't say it's like this for everyone since even people who came later than us got their food earlier so I think it's just hit or miss based on disorganization. The food is OK. I wouldn't come here just for the food though. The only shining light to this experience is that they served us foie gras when it's not available for lunch. But it is available for dinner, so why not just make it available at all times instead of making people ask for it?"
"I can't remember too much about my initial reaction when I stayed here.  I'm writing this review 5 months later so my memory is a bit fuzy. Go figure.  My stay was comfortable and convenient since it is connected to XS (my fav)!  The decor was very plain in comparison to my favorite hotel, The Venetian.  Other than that, I'd recommend giving this place a try.\n\nROOM SERVICE IS AMAZING!  I had a salmon and veggie dish while my friends ordered a veggie pizza and lobster mac and cheese.  Everything was mouth watering and flavorful!"
"This was one of two churches that my family and I frequented when we first moved to Las Vegas in 2003. After a while my parents decided that The Church LV would become our new church home. It was hard for my dad and I to get used to the church style at first. The music was wasn't like the traditional gospel music that we were used to. But beyond that, my family and I all love coming to The Church LV! There's so many ways for people to get involved and connected; whether it be by being an usher, serving in the children's ministry, or even helping out and being a parking attendant. There's also various groups that members of the church form that people can join. If you need a church home then you should definitely give The Church LV a try! It's so diverse here and the pastors are craze amaze!"
"Tried to sell a Tarentola annularis off as a tokay gecko. Two completely different species. Said he was lost in the store for five years before \""re-apprehending\"" a completely different gecko. They need to stick to fish, because their knowledge of reptiles is simply... lacking. I've been keeping tokay geckos for YEARS, but they refused to believe me. I will not be going back myself. The owner needs to open up his mind a little."
"I liked the old airport better.  I hate large, hard to navigate, walk forever to get to your gate airports.  My parents and I once didn't find each other till an hour after I landed because it was so big and confusing.  My parents always hated that there was ALWAYS construction going on there and it kept changing so you could never be sure the route you took one time would work the next time you went.  It was almost easier to just drive there from San Diego than to fly."
If I could give them 0 stars I would. This company sent an installer out to my house who bold faced lied to my face telling me that he was putting a cancelation fee clause into the contract. Then rushed me through signing all the documents and did not discuss that if I wanted to cancel the agreement I had 3 days well here I am 4 days after the deadline wanting to cancel this agreement because your company has already waisted a full 8 hours of my pay waiting on an installer who didn't show up and extremely dissatisfied with your service. I don't want your alarm system I just want to cancel and your company is doing absolutely nothing to help me exit the contract whether it be a fee or a pay off of my months payment for the literal 4 days extra this alarm system has been in my house. So don't let these people strong arm you because they will and will do anything they can to screw you out of your money.
"I don't go here often and with good reason -- there doesn't seem to be anything this bar offers that another place doesn't do better. If I wanted to dance or act crazy - there is Brothers. If I want to sit outside - I'd goto Vintage or Johnny O's. If I wanted a quieter place to sit down and talk - there is Red Shed, Segredo's(cause its usually dead) or Blue Velvet. The drinks are OK, the bartenders are OK and its ok to stop on a bar crawl but not somewhere I stay for long."
"Ikea for President.\n\nSeriously, could you imagine if our government was as efficient, affordable and useful as Ikea? Between the faux wood and the real wood, Ikea offers so many options for your home in all price ranges. The help is 7 out of 10 times helpful, and Ikea provides you with almost everything you need (string to tie something to the roof of your car, big bags/cart/dollys, measuring tape, pencils and notepads).\n\nI'm a big fan personally of the Hemnes line (real wood!) and have purchased it for my master bedroom and living room, so far with excellent results. In the past I've done Malm (haven't we all?) and was pleased with the small investment and the years I got out of that set. \n\nOnly downside to Ikea is the directions they give you to assemble stuff. No words! Just pictures, so make sure that you're well rested and have the patience of a saint when building the larger pieces (personally, I look to my gentleman friend to assemble everything - I throw things within 5 minutes)."
"Went this past Saturday night, and like everyone's said:\n\n- the outside of the club is worth the just the admission - paid $30 cover\n- drinks are $14-16 - jack and coke was strong, mind eraser was perfect\n- club makeup was about 90% Asian - that was fine with me, I'm EOE.\n- dance floor was packed - a little small in proportion to the entire place\n- got there around 10 - wait was about 10 minutes\n- females were pretty aggressive in all aspects, seemed like most of them listened to 'Took The Night' by Chelley on their drive to Vegas."
"I know this is a grocery store, but I have to say I'm such a fan of their food, that I usually just go here for a meal. \n \nI don't know whose idea it was to surround the entrance with huge cases of pastels, galletas, and pan dulce, but it works on me every time. Try to resist getting dessert first (but don't forget to save room). It's a good idea to just put your blinders on for now and make a beeline to the Aguas Frescas - they've got the best selection around. All are delicious, but my favorites have to be sandia, mel\u00f3n, or pi\u00f1a. (BTW - you can get a medium (20 oz) for one dollar on Wednesdays!) \n\nOnce you've got your beverage, its time for the really difficult decision. The good news is that you can't make a bad choice, but that doesn't make it any easier. The carne asada tacos, chile rellenos, and gorditas are great, but the torta is the best. Try the carnitas torta - it is absolutely divine and ginormous. Don't forget to pick up a few roasted jalape\u00f1os at the salsa bar for a smokey, spicy kick. Its one of those meals that you get and think there is no possible way you could finish it, but then you probably finish it anyway.  You're better off trying to save half for second lunch so you can get another treat on the way out, because you still have to head back through the pastry gauntlet for dessert. \n\nAgain, no bad options. The churros are fresh, the empanadas are amazing in any flavor, and the orejas dipped in chocolate are actually too big to finish on your own. That's okay though, I'm always up for the challenge. \n\nOh, and since this is a grocery store, enjoy a little shopping while you're there. (As long as you're not in a hurry - everything takes a little longer at Ranch Market.) I pretty much stick to the perimiter - fresh tortillas & chips, quesos, and the largest selection of salchichas I've ever seen are a few highlights."
"If you can find another hotel, I'd go that route. I've given PH so many opportunities to redeem themselves, but for some reason, they keep messing up! I've never experienced such horrible customer service--both in person and on the phone. I honestly don't think they even understand the concept of customer service, which is unfortunate. Not once has PH ever provided me with the full experience of \""Vegas.\"" But it's alright--I'm from southern ca so a trip to Vegas comes far too often than I intend it to. There are so many better hotels on the strip and I've definitely gotten a great experience there!\n\nOhh, and one last thing about ph: my best friend didn't like their pillows...so if your beauty sleep depends on the pillow you sleep on, don't expect much from PH"
"I am a frequent customer of this establishment and I appreciate the quality of their beer and the consistency of good service in the bar area. I have only dined in the main seating area twice, and one time it resulted in a beer bath for my wife and infant son but hey, que sera sera right? My overall experience with GB has been positive. Food is good quality but overpriced in my opinion. I tend to take advantage of their happy hour specials if possible. I have had a couple snafus regarding my order, one in particular where my dinner salad came after the entree, but they comped the salad and apologized, no big deal. My go to brew is the hefeweizen, you will not be disappointed with its banana-clovey smoothness. Cheers!"
"This dry-cleaners is close to my house. Although they advertise \""Most items $2.50\"", several of mine were priced higher, with seemingly no rhyme or reason to it.  The service was friendly, however, and they don't require pre-payment.\n\nOne really notable thing that happened, however, was that the young man who handled my items and rang me up when I dropped off my clothes must have miscounted.  My receipt/bill said $23.55.  When I went to pick up my clothes, they said that I owed $30.31.  I questioned it, and she explained that he had miscounted and I actually had 12 items cleaned instead of 9.  I probably looked upset, but I didn't say anything.  She said that she'd give me a discount because of the error and only charged me $26. I thought that was very considerate and I really appreciated the customer service."
Potato latke Rachel is unique and genius. Flavor is excellent and the sandwich melts in your mouth. Reasonable prices and large portions. Great experience!
"It's nice to see a shop exclusively for men on the high street that doesn't only sell suits!\nBurton fills a gap in the market for those too proud to go to Topman or too poor to go to Cruise. It's bang on!\n\nthe prices are pretty decent for what they sell, and the stuff is always on trend and pretty fashionable really. The staff are always really happy to help and really grounded, refreshigly so!\n\nPlus if you're a student, it's 10% off! woohoo"
"I have been here twice in the last year and both times were amazing. I went with my wife both times and we requested a table with a view, and when we got there we sat right in the corner and we were able to see all the people walking the strip and the cool Wynn sign. The place is huge so it is a great place for large parties as well. If you don't want to take a lot of food home (or back to the hotel room) then just order the 1/2 orders instead and even though it still may be tons of food at least you wont be wasting it. All the drinks are wonderful and the food is great every time we come here. Sure its just like any other Maggianos as far as taste goes but its Vegas so there is a little added something. I talk to the GM of this restaurant like once a month and he is a really nice guy. The staff is great and the views are amazing. If you have not been here..go and if you have been here ...go back. \n\nPeace Out, \nMZ"
"If you stay here get a tower room. They are reasonably priced and fairly modern. All the other rooms are a glorified version of \""pay by the hour\"" rooms. They're dated and they stink. The sportsbook is more like a sportsbook museum. They actually still write the odds on a white board. How quaint, or sad, depending on how you look at it. Go there after 3 am and you will see the shift change strippers piling in to throw away their \""hard earned money\"". The oyster bar used to be hidden gem but now its a victim of it's own success. Long lines for food that no longer hits the mark. They must advertise in Orange County, CA because the oyster bar is always packed with asians from OC. More proof that nothing good in Vegas lasts. As far as the casino goes, its smoky and relatively low class. That begger at the corner of Sahara and the Strip you gave 50 cents to? Well, you just might meet up with them at the blackjack tables. Enjoy"
"I dragged my party down to Slots-A-Fun because it was the last place that I knew on the strip that had coin operated machines.  I miss that *ching*ching*ching* sound and a bucket full of nickels, unfortunately, it's gone from here too."
"I was a loyal customer of this Discount Tire up until this week. They replaced a wheel for me in 2013 following a car accident. They offered me a hubcap, but I wanted it to match the others, so I was very explicit with them that I would be purchasing a factory hubcap. When I purchased the first hubcap off ebay, it didn't fit properly on the wheel, and I assumed I had purchased the wrong hubcap by mistake.\n\nIn May, when GM recalled my car, I ordered a factory hubcap through my dealer to make sure it was right this time. When that one didn't fit, I realized the wheel was the problem. When I called Discount Tire, they said of course it doesn't fit, you have one of our stock wheels on. Had it been explained to me that the wheel wouldn't fit the hubcap I was VERY clear that I wanted, I never would have purchased it!\n\nThey assured me this would be fixed, and that they would not only order me the correct wheel, but would take off the cost of the wheel I had already purchased. I gave them a month, and called back to inquire as to the status of my order. They explained that they  had placed the order, but since they ordered it from the factory, they were waiting on GM to ship it. I got the same story again in July, and August. When I called again this month, I was told that they didn't have an order for me out at all, there was no note on my account about any of this, and they had no idea what I was talking about. I either fell through the cracks, or someone decided I simply wasn't worth the trouble or the money I had spent there.\n\nI am livid, and will never give this location another dime. I contacted another discount tire, and they got me a new wheel by the next business day, no hassle!"
"I just have to say that this location always exceeds my expectations. I also have to add that I am very glad to have this location in our area of town as it's worth the few extra minutes out of my way if it means avoiding the customer service abuse from the N. Decatur/215 location.\n\nLast week was my most recent visit. I was completely wow'd. So I'm making my way home and decide I don't feel like cooking so I call up this location and place a phone order with 3 meals. Two problems though...\n\nI just picked up my furchild from Camp Bow Wow, and it's sweltering hot outside. How am I going to go inside and pick up this food? Surely I am not aloud to bring her inside with me and surely I would never leave her in the car under the weather conditions. I sat in the parking lot contemplating  should I take her home and come all the way back or do I see if I can seek out a good citizen to watch my pup for a few min while I run inside and pay? NO! I can't do any of those things, am I crazy? No I'm not, just hungry. \n\nWhile sitting in the parking lot with my pup, I place a call to the restaurant. A super nice girl answers the phone, and I really wish I remembered her name so I could\nShout her out! I explained my situation and ask if there is any way they can bring my food to the car? She said YES without hesitation. She even acknowledged my pup and said hello to her when she came out to the car. \n\nSo to end this long story I was super stoked that this location just continues to be so awesome and provided above and beyond service to me and my pup. PLUS...my order was RIGHT!!! SCORE!\n\nAdd on from a previous visit on different date: I order all our food, get to the counter to pay, and realize my wallet is missing. It's dinner time rush. So embarrassed and with people waiting behind me, I ask the cashier if there  is anyway I can call my bf and get his cc # to pay over the phone. She says sure no problem (I think she could see my embarrassment and worried look). How awesome was that? They totally could have turned me away. Again with the above and beyond! :)"
"Horrible service.  Every time we go to the Vig our servers never come by to check up on us. Last time we went, we sat for an entire hour before the server came back again. It's a shame because we really enjoy the atmosphere and the food is pretty good."
The food is great ..we had curry chicken . sesame chicken and tempura shrimp .hot and sour soup .all of  the food was great ...
I just ate the saddest grill cheese I've ever come across. They put one slice of cheese on the bread and the cheese didn't go to the ends of the bread... Sorry to be harsh but I am disappointed. The last time I was here food was great but this time it seemed like they slapped it on there. The cooks need to put more passion into making their food. :/
Not sure if Carly's has lowered their price or not but the food was very reasonable.  Sandwiches around 8 bucks and hummus and pita dip was 5.  Plus they have a 2 dollar beer special so cool!  I really like this place.  The server at our table was a little bit snobbish but other then that this is a great late night place to eat!   The food is a little bit trendy and posh but the prices not so much.   I don't  we went at 11pm on a Friday night and the food was served hot and fresh not like warm lamp fresh.  They give you way too much pita for your hummus but its so tasty you can eat it plain.  \n\nThey warm it up which is a plus since a lot of places now a days think that cold stale pita is the way to go.  I had a pear sandwich grilled panini style which had Bree pear and prosciutto.  \n\nThe Prosciutto was very thin just how it should be and Bree tasted very fresh.  I will be going back here for late night munching !\n\nOne last note they also have live music on the weekends ! Great fun!
"you get what you pay for.\n\nmy daughter is allergic to my cats so when she comes into town, i put her up at nice hotels.  on her last day in town, she checked out of her hotel, and we spent the day at the breathtaking Valley of Fire, hiking in 100 degree weather.  needless to say, we were exhausted when i drove her back to her car in the hotel's parking lot.  i didn't want her driving at night when she was so tired, and went on the internet to quickly find some place for her to stay at the last minute that wouldn't stretch my already overspent budget for her stay in vegas..\n\nthe riviera came up and the price was very cheap.  i made an online reservation and we drove there.\n\nthe valet was very nice and when he saw i was on portable oxygen, he said he would park the car close by so i wouldn't have to wait long when i finished checking her in.  that was pretty nice!\n\nwe went to the lobby and we were both impressed by the huge chandelier in the lobby.  very pretty.  there was a VERY loooong line to check in, so i thought this place must be great, to be so crowded!  my daughter stood in line with me for a while, but she was so tired, i told her to go sit down on the couch and she did.  i had left my oxygen in the car, thinking i would be right back out.  bad idea.  i was in line for over an hour, exhausted, watching my daughter practically falling asleep on the couch.\n\nafter an hour, i finally got up to the desk.  the check in lady was actually very sweet and very personable and helpful.  i asked her to please give my daughter a view of the strip and she said no problem.\n\nwe got the room key and made our way to the room.  it seemed like forever to walk down hallway after hallway, get to the elevator, and get up to her floor and into her room.  \n\ni was not very happy with the room.  it looked outdated and i wasn't  too sure about the cleanliness because the lamp was pretty dim, but the bathroom light was bright and it looked clean.  i went to the window and looked out, and the \""strip view\"" i requested was a joke.  there were plenty of rooms that would have offered a REAL strip view and i would have gladly paid more for that if given the choice.  but i wasn't about to go downstairs and wait another hour so i was going to call the front desk when my daughter said not to worry about it.\n\nthere were excellent drink specials in the bar which was really great.  i mean really really inexpensive, surprising for being on the strip.  however she really wanted to use the pool to relax before going to bed but it was closed.  it was only about  9 pm.  i was really surprised they closed the pool so early.  so much for getting any of the 'resort\"" that we paid a \""resort fee\"" for.\n\nmy daughter said she slept well and the bed was OK.  after hiking all day in 100 degree temps, i think any bed would have felt good!\n\nbut as i said, you get what you pay for.  it was one of the cheapest rooms in the city that night, and it kept my daughter from having to drive when she was too tired to drive, so it suited its purpose.  when i got back to the valet stand about an hour and a half later, the valet was true to his word, remembered my first name and his promise, and got my car to me extremely fast."
"Went here on the last day of Restaurant week for my friend's bachelor party.  They had an incredible $50 3-course prix fixed menu and got the wine tasting for $25.  While the food was top notch, the service from the staff and particularly our waiter Alex, was just incredible in every aspect.\n\nAlex was very courteous and helpful in describing the menu items, made recommendations on the wine tasting and I think he was generous with the pourings since it was the last day of the promotion and they had some extra wine not on their normal menu.  We were his only table after another party left, so he was very attentive, but his bussers were also awesome.\n\nThe resturant week promotion also contributes to threequare.org which support local food banks so we got to make a positive contribution for our weekend of debauchery.\n\nOn to the food:\nI started out with the french onion soup, it's in a cup, so it's not a huge portion, but it was delicious.  Other folks got the caesar and wedge, no complaints from anyone on the starters.\n\nI had the kona-crusted sirloin medium rare which I recommend.  It's on a hot plate so it cooks for a little bit.  Hint of coffee, but plenty of flavor in the crust and juicy meat.\n\nThe filets also got high marks from the bachelor, and the desserts were pretty good.\n\nI don't like to frequent the same restaurants in Vegas since there's so much great food to try, but when they open a Capital Grille in San Diego, I'll be at the ribbon cutting!"
"Without a doubt, the most expensive meal I have ever had - but before you run away, here is our story...\n\nCame here with my best friend and his wife (a definite fine dining aficionado) as one of our \""last hurrah\"" outings before kids... hence my wife was about 3 months pregnant and still nauseous most of the time.  HINT - rich food and morning sickness are not compatible, hence I ended up eating BOTH prix fixe dinners (poor wife could only manage some table bread and a little of the sorbet that they served between courses while the friend's wife was moaning in ecstasy with every bite of foie gras).\n\nAnyhow, there are plenty of reviews here to vouch for the food, the service, the atmosphere, the experience - and they are all spot on.  Just wanted to share our story.  Will definitely plan on taking the wife back there for one of our anniversaries."
lots of shopping came to buy things\n\ndodged asian tourist to get to stores\n\nspent money - would do again
Great place for drinks and happy hour.
"Vegas is a turd, plain and simple, and the Luxor exemplifies all that Vegas has become since its decline from the golden era. So, the Luxor. The building is rundown, and ill-maintained. Rude, rude, rude staff are everywhere. The notion of service in Las Vegas is a thing of the past, and again, this is typified by just how crappy the Luxor is. The room, while tired in appearance, was acceptable, but very mediocre for a strip \""super hotel\"". The bartenders at their in-house bars were the rudest asses, and needed to have their noses bloodied for the snide, snobby comments and smarmy, rude, conceited attitudes. No tips for them. Wankers. Just an all-around bad experience. I couldn't wait to leave the Luxor, and the city, too. The novelty of the shape of their building is their only lure. One really can't help but stand on an indoor balcony a few floors up, and admire the engineering. But as for the hospitality...these people have no concept of guest care or hospitality. It'll be too soon, if I never again visit Las Vegas."
"First time there, last time I will come back.  I really just came in for a rootbeer which they no longer have on tap, which makes me very sad.  But i was in the mood for fish.  I ordered one of there combos and the service here was awesome, thats the only reason why they got another star from me.  The staff is great.  \nAnyway the fish was way too salty, everything was dipped in oil, and truthfully after I ate the food I regret my decision.  It didnt sit right, and i felt disgusted.  Everything was room temp and after walking out the door, i knew I was not coming back."
"Great burgers! The build your own burden is great, and if it doesn't taste good its on you. The burger itself was cooked to perfection. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very sweet. I like the classic rock that was playing and knew all the words to every song. The avocado on hubby's burger was thick and fresh. We also took the recommendation of the steak fries and it worth it, hot and cooked well. Fun place."
"The office staff isn't rude, every time my husband and I walk in they are always nice to us. I really like this place the pool area is nice and now they are building a play ground which is great. Mike, dawn, and Cynthia are great with good customer service. And the rent is a great price. I really don't see why ppl complaining on here.  Maybe they saw everybody reviews and decided to act right . I'm moving in soon & I hope they give me no problems because then I would be pissed. I'll be sure to keep yelp updated !"
"What's the big deal?  Atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, local products and good selection.  I shop at Amazon and at Changing Hands.\n\nI really think this is a great place.  I buy most of my gifts from here, I like to give books and local artist's stuff.  The store is a really jewel in valley because of its local flavor and its commitment to keeping Tempe smart and informed.  There are very few bookstores as good as this one in America anymore, clean, stocked and popular.\n\nAnd being attached to a Wildflower is good for anybody."
I love it here.  Everyone is happy and friendly. The pool was nice and relaxing. I ate at 5 different places.  Yummy at all 5. Love walking around the forum shops. It's just a happy place.  The cons of this place is the smell of smoke.  It seemed really strong. I had my kids with me. They had a blast.
"Friendly staff, clean bathroom, ATM worked, cheap drinks in comparison to other places in the area.  I'll be back often..."
"This place had me hypnotized. There are 30 restaurants in the Venetian and I had my first 3 meals here. I'm not a Chinese food or noodle freak. I just really liked the food, either that or they got me hooked on MSG or something. Whatever I was, I couldn't take my palette off them for 2 days and I will be searching for food of similar quality back in Philly. I've decided to check Chinatown since I think it's likely there are a few Chinese restaurants there."
"I've used Ted Wiens before and have had no problems. Plus, I have their little sticker coupon book so I wanted to take advantage of my discount.. But when I called to check up on the status of the oil change for my Lexy on Friday I was notified that in addition to the oil change, I was in desperate need of 2 new front brake pads, 2 new front rotors, 2 new rear tires and that my heating hose needed to be re-clamped because it was leaking.. I asked how much it would all be and was told it would be over $1000 :X FML but then I was told I would be given a little discount because of my coupon book bringing it down to around $975. Told them that I would think about it and call them back. \n\nI called another auto shop in the area to compare prices and was shocked when they told me that they would charge me a flat rate of $650. So I paid for the oil-change ($48 Synthetic Blend & that's with the $10 discount because my car holds 7 quarts of oil or something like that lol) and took my car down a few blocks to the other shop... While driving, I noticed Ted Wiens didn't even replace my next due oil change sticker and then later I found out that they rotated the rear tire on the right side of my car to the front (only the right side & not the left) which is very dangerous because they are 2 different sizes! UGH!\n\nThe sales representative at Ted Wiens, Christian, has always been super nice but I can't help but feel those prices were a bit of a rip off."
"This review is based on a selling experience I had just yesterday. I brought in name brand jeans, dresses, jackets, tops and shoes that were never worn (most of the clothing wasn't worn either, or very gently used). I don't know who these \""buyers\"" think they are, but they are extremely rude and picky to the point of why bother asking people to bring clothes in?! A brand new White House Black Market dress, never worn was turned away because, \""We have so many dresses already, we have to make a profit somehow.\"" (mind you on the phone they specifically asked for DRESSES) Its surprising to see how they can make a profit, seeing that most everything in there is ugly, old, and sometimes smelly! To tout yourself as a \""high end boutique thrift store\"" is quite frankly a misnomer and a joke. I'm sorry if I was not hip enough to sell there, but just down the street at Trend Traders I was."
I love the eclectic atmosphere. ..I also love the assortment of desserts!! The lines are loooong but it moves pretty fast. My favorite sweet is the Salted Caramel Brownie. .soooooo yummy!!!!
"when I was in San Jose, I always know where to go for a great Vietnamese food.\nfinally I found another place here when I'm travelling in Phoenix.\nthis place is a local for people looking for a great vietnamese food.\ncan't go wrong if you want an authentic vietnamese food."
"I live right around the corner and have never noticed this place since you can't even see the sign driving by it.  But if you drive by very slowly you can see the sign by the street telling you what they have in this strip mall and it just says \""coffee\"" for this place.  I ordered Going Bananas which is apparently their specialty drink and oh man~tastes exactly like chocolate covered bananas and it is DELICIOUS! The best part of that experience is how friendly the guy who works there is.  I'm not too sure if he's the boss or not, but he was very helpful and super nice! There are also a few games like checker that you can play there.  And I love the seating arrangement since you can have your individual table for laptop use then there's this super comfy sofa, I was so surprised when I sat down and sunk into it :)"
"To Yelp readers - Avoid this airline. On a recent trip, I was denied full access to my seat (middle passenger encroached on half of my space, creating an intolerable experience and safety hazard. Not only did U S Airways not make alternative arrangements, but refused a prorated refund. They spent more in capital and staff expense \""defending\"" their indefensible position that the cost of the refund and created some poor advertisement as a result. A brief Facebook scan reveals many other complaints. I note several similar complaints on Yelp, also."
"I've been going to Darque Tan on and off for about three years now. This location keeps a nice, clean store and offers about 20 beds of varying intensity levels. I usually use a level 2 bed which carries a max of 20 minutes and gives me a nice color.\n\nI went in today to buy a new package after taking a 6 month hiatus from tanning, and the sales associate was incredibly helpful. She took her time pulling about five bottles of lotion off the shelves and explaining all their different qualities and price points; she was very knowledgeable and I really appreciated her doing that. She didn't just pressure me in to buying the most expensive lotion they offer. \n\nDarque Tan offers monthly memberships as well as pre-paid packages; I use the $33.88/month package that allows for unlimited tans in level 1 and 2 beds at any DT location.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give five stars is because their lotions are pretty pricey. I bought a \""middle of the road\"" lotion with bronzers and DHA properties and it ran me $92, but they are offering a special right now that purchasing a lotion gives you money credited back to your account for upgrades."
Great food lots of portion!
"The salmon carpaccio, calamari and tenderloin appetizers were delightful.  I'm looking forward to going back and ordering the crab dip and an entree.  The bartenders were fantastic and I would consider going back just for them.  They said they have half priced appetizers from 5:30-7:30pm during the weekdays (double check that because I had A LOT of yummy wine there tonight and I may have misunderstood).  I'll definitely be back for more."
"LOVE, LOVE DR. KHAIRAH!  I am a super baby when it comes to going to the dentist.  Anxiety attack city!  I had a deep cleaning and didn't feel a thing!  He took the time to make sure my mouth was numb, and was extremely gentle and thorough.    The staff are super friendly, and I will never go to another dentist as long as he is anywhere within driving distance!  Love you doc!  And thank you!"
"I met the owners of this repair store and they are so cute and really\nknow their business. They were able to complete my small repair\nwhile I waited, this was so nice. They have been doing\nthis for over 20 years.  Ask them any questions pertaining to the\nquality or service of a watch and they will have the answer.  All\nservice is done in house, so there is no need for shipping.   I\nreally enjoyed my conversation with them and would recommend to\neveryone.  Location is great - NE corner of Warner & McClintock."
"Living in the Phoenix heat, there's hundreds of HVAC companies to chose from, so of course i went to yelp for a good company with integrity that stands out from the rest,  so Benefit was called. From the dispatcher Mack taking my work order, to the tech, chuck, i was happy, and felt no pressure."
"The food is good... we used to go almost every Saturday but then the waitress started to recognize us and make weird comments and it creeped me out. The decor leaves something to be desired... I've seen more style in a Perkins. So depressing. But if those things don't matter to you, it's decent food for a decent price. But we won't be going back any time soon."
"Chez Serge might just be one of the coolest places I've ever set foot in dans Montreal. \n\nMaybe it's the fact that I was expecting something entirely different with the name and limited description, both leaving me shocked when I walked in. A flame print painted door could lead to anything! A bouncer will then size you up. \n\nThe space is very unique to say the least. Zebra print here, grass on the walls and ceiling there. Plastic, colourful, ornate chandeliers hanging down just as elegantly as the bras that hang off a moose head by the bar. And we know why! It seems the girls dancing on stripper poles (free will, unpaid) on the bar are a permanent fixture. \n\nI ordered a bucket of cosmopolitan and that is no exaggeration. I actually received a turquoise and pink, children's playschool bucket of mixed drink, various citrus slices and six colourful straws. The thing is a bit unwieldy but you're in good company. Every fifth person has one so it's not that weird to be carrying it around with two hands. \n\nThe best part of Chez Serge is the reason why you should make it a destination. FREE MECHANICAL BULL RIDING. You don't have to sign a waiver, you don't have to pay a cent. You just have to hop into the ring in the crucial three second break after someone else gets thrown off. Your ride will be projected in live time to various other locations of the bar so be good! Note: if you're a dude or the guy handling the joystick doesn't like you, your ride will be infinitely shorter. But it's so fun! They play really fun music at the same time so feel free to get your groove on while you ride. \n\nIf you can snag a booth, the service is really great. Not to mention everyone that works there is quite attractive and wearing a tight, black, Chez Serge T-Shirt. And they will also clear everything, give good drink suggestions and help girls off the bar that have had one too many. Sweethearts. \n\nIf you can't tell already, I will definitely be coming back to this establishment when I'm in MTL."
"Review for the sportsbook specifically-\n6 months ago, this was the best sportsbook on The Strip. Now the TVs are blocked off by a terribly placed bar, and anything resembling comfortable seating is blocked off as Members Only (regardless of the fact that seating was only at half occupancy at most). It's insulting placing hundreds of dollars in bets and being given a shitty conference room chair to sit in. If you want to see a good sportsbook gone terribly wrong, head to Caesars."
I had a super rude cashier made a huge fuss over a exchange of a broken item. I would have bought but because of her rudeness I did my exchange and left I didn't get her name but on my receipt it says cashier 1271421
"My electricity went out in both of my bathrooms.  I went down to the circuit breaker and reset all of the breakers.  The power was still out.  I read a positive review about Mr. Electric and called them to look at my issue.  I spoke with the operator who was very pleasant and was told that the electrician would be there at 9:00am.  He did not arrive until 9:45am.  My wife told him the issue that we were having.  He went to where the circuit breakers were and to the side of the circuit breaker there is an electrical outlet with a test and surge protector button.  He pressed the button and all was fixed.  The electrician was at my house not even 5 minutes.  He then proceeds to charge my family $150 for the 5 minutes of work.  I understand charging a fee for coming out for a job, but $150 for 5 minutes of work does not seem justifiable to me."
"quality of their meat is great and it's cooked per your request. i ordered medium, i got medium. it can be a bit pricey with many of the add-ons being $0.65+ each (e.g., cheese, bacon, grilled onions, jalapenos, etc).\n\nthe problem is with their lack of seasoning. a little salt and pepper goes a long way. had our burgers been properly seasoned, i think this could've been really good, buuuut they weren't."
"The owner's response is incorrect. NO one has contacted me. No one has emailed me since my last email to you directly as well. You are a liar. \n\nIn an email from your establishment, you suggested that I take time out of my day to come to your establishment to explain to your waitstaff what the issues are. Multiple members of your waitstaff, including management ARE the issue. I explained this in an email to you. I've been treated rudely over the phone and in person multiple times. Your DM had previously stated that this was because of how much I used to frequent your establishment--that my large number of bad experiences were because I was a regular customer. That is just the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! I get bad experiences because I spend my money and pay your wages more often than other people? Are you f@#$%^&* kidding me???!!!\n\nAgain, multiple times, in a row, you forgot items when I picked up orders to go. Your waitstaff was rude in person and over the phone.No one is checking orders. I used to manage restaurants and work every position in one. I would make drastic changes if I were you.\n\nIf I came to your establishment, ordered food, ate it, and did not pay for it--you would call the police and I would be charged for defrauding the establishment. \nIn this case, I paid you and you did not (on multiple occasions) give me the food that  I paid for. You also double charged my bf's card, and when we came in to eat breakfast with a gift certificate I asked the waitress what happened to any unused portion. She became very upset (I was very nice), rushed to get the manager, who very sternly told me there would be no cash back. Excuse me, I never asked for cash back, I asked if the left over would be issued on a new certificate. I don't want your handouts. You have me confused with \""one of those people\"". \n\nI have found much better places to spend my money on  weekly if not biweekly basis. I was never rude to any of your staff. I was always polite. Same with my bf. You have consistently screwed up over the last six months.\n\nOne final thought: I live very close by (that is why I spent so much money here! convenience!), and noticed a family entering your establishment. You might want to remove TYGA from your hold music if you are trying to be a family place. I've never heard of Tyga previously, and it was only while being on hold hearing \""bouncing on my d$%^ that I had to Google it to find out what the heck was being played. Do your associates choose your hold music??????????????\n\nAs an owner, I would ask myself \""did I hire new employees or new management within the last six months?\"" I am guessing so. Make the needed corrections before you permanently lose more regular customers."
good atmosphere.. Reasonably priced... attentive staff.. can get busy...
"I was working in Phoenix and was told that I had to try Delux, as they had the best burger and sweet potato fries I would ever have.  The fries were pretty good, but I don't think they were anything above average.  The burger, though, I thought left a lot to be desired.  It was juicy, but I would actually call it more grease-laden than truly juicy.  I like a moist burger, but I don't want grease dripping off the bun.  That was my major problem.  That may be what some people like, but I didn't."
"This is not your typical Mom and Pop Mexican joint, it's not Arriba's or Macayo's either. This is local fresh Mexican and is one of the best places you can hit in Phoenix. Start at the bar with a beer or a tasty margarita.\nOne you get a table, you can't go wrong starting out with chips and guacamole. But for a really awesome start, go with the chicharron de queso which is a yummy cheese crisp accompanied with an aioli dipping sauce-it really is out of this world. Ideally come with a group so you can justify ordering that AND the chips and guac.\nThe tacos are tasty and very reasonably priced-I recommend the carne asada and shrimp tacos. If you order a lot of different tacos it may be hard to keep track of which is which since they are brought to your table on metal racks. I also had a side of pint beans which were great.\nThe service is friendly and attentive. I planned on drinking a lot on this particular visit and followed through on my plan. Fortunately they kept my water glass full so that could stay hydrated. Thanks to them and five advil, I was 80 percent functional by mid-day the following day (I think we were the last ones to leave that night)\nIf you haven't already check this place out. The food and drinks are fantastic and reasonably priced-you really can't go wrong."
"This is a great gym. It's small so it isn't overwhelming. They have exactly what you need to get a good workout in. There aren't any meat heads like at globo gym, I mean golds. The staff is friendly and Ralph is great! There's some nice eye candy from time to time as well. The steam room is a great feature as well. I actually prefer this location over the Shea location because you don't have to deal with all the D-bag high school kids working out on their phones taking up equipment. Arin at the desk makes a killer smoothie too!"
"After looking for the best deal, and most conveniently located hotel, that was somewhat affordable in Las Vegas during CES, Dan and I settled (and SETTLED we did), for the Flamingo Hotel. Within walking distance of the Venetian, where we could visit many of the exhibitors, and easily catch a shuttle to the Convention Center, the Flamingo Hotel turned out to be the SECOND MOST DISGUSTING PLACE in which we have ever stayed. Rooms at this hovel (not a typo) range from 35.00 in the low season to 289.00 for rip off season. They have a lot of nerve.Arriving at midnight after a LONG ASS day of flying due to a snow storm in our layover city, Chicago, all we wanted was a quick bite and a comfy bed, on which to rest our pretty heads. Sadly, the line to check in, had at least 20 people in front of us. We waited patiently, knowing that would happen very soon. We checked in, then walked through the smoky filled casino to the FOOD COURT to grab a bite.\nWe waited on line to order a burger and salad, at Johnny Rocket's. seconds, I finally go to order my long awaited tuna salad, at 12:00 midnight and 3 seconds. \""We don't serve tuna after midnight\"". I perused the menu, and SETTLED on a turkey burger. \""We don't serve turkey burgers after midnight\"", said the fellow at the cash register.\n\""Are you kidding me?\"", I asked. He wasn't.\""We serve burgers or eggs\"", the young man told me.\nDan ordered his burger and I sauntered over to the other seemingly healthy food option, a Chinese Chicken Salad from L.A. salad and wraps.\nSuffice it to say, the CHICKEN that was on top of this lettuce, green onion, fried chinese noodle mix, was not EXACTLY chicken. It was other worldly. I think maybe it was chicken roll or something else fashioned into a flat cutlet type thing.\nWe guzzled the food, and couldn't wait to get upstairs, proving that when I'm hungry I will eat anything.\nArrving on the 8th floor, it was clear that they place was a well worn. The halls weren't all that clean. I take that back. They were gross. There were rips in the carpet, along with gum smooshed into it. The doors were all dirty too. I chalked it up to old age, and was a little forgiving, but still not happy.\nThe room came with a view (this was NOT it), and all the loud sounds that come, an entire city block of construction. Right outside my window! The room, with its ancient furniture, wasn't HORRIBLE.\nThe roach crawling on the wall, on the other hand was.The bathroom was replete with toothpaste. Oh, not toothpaste to use with my toothbrush.\nThis toothpaste, was in the air conditioning grates....Perhaps the maid missed it...All five days, that we stayed there.\nShe also missed the q-tip that was stuck in between the missing tiles. Well, they weren't missing, they were just behind the toilet. She did miss the giant hair that was stuck to the ceiling also.\nNone of this was nearly as nauseating as the 2 inches of dust, that was living in the bathroom lighting fixtures. Let's just say the place is a little run down. Understatement.\nThe toilet was also DISGUSTING. ALL FIVE DAYS.\nAfter checking for bedbugs, assuming that the housekeeping staff, would make sure that the room was really clean the next day, we HAD TO GO TO sleep. It was already after 1:30AM, and I was in no mindset, to call to bitch and moan. Did I just say that? We had to be up and out by 8:00AM, and I needed some rest.\nI woke up with a stiff neck from using pillows that ranged from 6-8 inches high. Right before we left in the morning, I called housekeeping and asked for one, only one, DECENT pillow, explaining that these were all too rubbery and hard and I couldn't afford to work CES with a neck ache. She said, \""Sure thing. No problem.\""\nLater that night ( it was actually the next morning at around 1:30), we arrived back to the room after a LONG day of press events and parties, ready for sleep. The beds had been made, the garbage disposed of, towel folded, and sink cleaned. The toothpaste, dust, broken tiles and q-tip all remained untouched. Doesn't the housekeeping staff get trained in CLEANING?In addition, as far as I could tell, there was no pillow replacement. They all ranged from 6-8 inches high, and impossible for me to use. I slept without one.The next morning, with another crick in my neck, I called to ask about the pillows. This time the answer was, \""Those are the ONLY pillows that we have. They are all the same. The housekeeper brought you a new one\"". I scratched my head. We spied these two pillows on the floor....yes I said, \""on the floor\"", in front of another guest's room. They were there for at least 8 hours. Clearly I am not the only one, that doesn't like sleeping on HARD RUBBER. But I digress."
"This establishment used to have excellent service and food, but sadly this has not been the case the last few times I have visited El Encanto. I am in no means picky with what I eat, and I am not comparing 5 star meals to a place such as this, but their Plato Burro consisted of a few strands of dry meat shoved into a cold tortilla. The rice was cold, beans microwaved, and the server came around to the table once every twenty minutes or so. The only thing that prevents this place from having 1 star in my book is the pretty duck pond, and their salsa is very good. Avoid this place and head somewhere else if you want good mexican food."
Horrible customer service skills. Linda that helped us need a attitude adjustment. \nWon't go back to this location.
"Love Big Dog Coffee! I am a huge fan of the oatmeal bar, iced coffee and iced lattes. I normally visit this spot everyday before work (oatmeal and iced coffee). \n\nThe interior space is beautiful, sort of a anthropologie feel to it. A lot of eclectic pieces with out looking like a cheesy TGI Fridays. Also the patio area has charming wrought iron furniture for the occasional nice day in Pittsburgh. \n\nPro: really friendly staff, oatmeal bar, sunny interior, great coffee\nCon: Oatmeal bar can be a bit pricey( although the serving is huge), could use a couple more comfy cars. \n\nOverall: Great place for studying, reading, first date and people watching!"
"My mom treated us for my daughter's birthday here since it wasn't too far from my brother's home.  This was probably my least favorite of the Chinese buffets my mom has taken us to the past couple years.\n\nThe service was not too bad, but the selection wasn't as good as it could be and the foot just not as tasty.  Some foods seemed to have been sitting there for awhile, therefore, things that should be soft were hard.\n\nIt just wasn't as tasty as Krazy Buffet or the ones in the Phx area that we like.  The place had a nice ambiance, though, the tables were a bit high for those people who are shorter.\n\nThe taste just didn't make this place appealing to me to go back.  Thankful to my mom who treated us.  It was $13.95 per person for dinner and that included a non-alcoholic drink."
"What can I say. Disappointed!! Very disappointed. Especially after reading the Yelp reviews. I did a lot of research on where to eat in Las Vegas. I did not want to pay the $200.00 plus price tag of some of the top top rated places, but, I am a foodie and wanted a memorable meal. \nFirst, my partner and I had a reservation, and were seated at an extremely large 4-6 top table (I usually appreciate a big table) however, this was completely impersonal. By the way we were eating at 6:30 p.m. so it was not crowded. We asked for another table and were seated at a banquette. The server arrived, but acted as if he was not expecting company. \nThe best experience was with the sommelier, whose name unfortunately I cannot remember. He gave great recommendations for glasses of wine and even brought tastes for my partner. He was very friendly and nice to talk to(more later).\nMy partner ordered the kobe beef burger and I ordered the San Francisco Cioppino (imagining that this would be stellar given Michael Mina's roots).  The burger was terrific, the fries however, were over salted(I am a salt lover, so really too much) and frankly pretty ordinary. \nNow to my Cioppino, first, it was obvious from the first bite that the fish and shellfish were pre-cooked, no, really. I could not believe it, also, the temperature of the whole dish was off. The \""broth\"" which is actually more like a tomato saucea was not hot enough, too thick and just bland and ordinary tasting. The combination of the pre-cooked fish and shellfish was really not good. I only ate the lobster tail and the scallop(also not cooked correctly). The sommelier came by towards the end of the meal and asked how everything was (the server never returned to ask). I asked him if he really wanted to know and I told him about the above. I saw him tell the server, who never asked us and just brought us a trio of sorbets (the chocolate was yummy but the peach and mango tasted like Sharon's.) \nOverall, I would never recommend this restaurant or eat here again. I was glad to take the complimentary copy of WIne Spectator with Michael Mina on the cover, but would be reticent to try his restaurants again."
"I love KFC, but this location is horrible. I stopped by on 7/21/14 and bought 2 meals. The chicken was dry and way overcooked. They really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook. I have been going to this location for several years now, and the first few times the chicken was awesome (about 3 years ago), but it has gone downhill since then. The other location that went downhill closed last year (105th / Indian School). I really hope the corporation looks at these reviews and attempts to solve the problems, because KFC is our favorite place for chicken. I gave 1 star for the side dishes."
"Relativ gro\u00dfer Lebensmittelladen f\u00fcr Asiatische Spezialit\u00e4ten und Grundnahrungsmittel.\n\n\n Ich kaufe hier immer meine Sushi Zutaten ein. Der Sushi Reis ist wirklich gut zu verarbeiten und auch sionst findet man alles (eingelegter Rettich, diverse Saucen, Sesam in allen Varianten, ...)\n\n\n Nicht so gut best\u00fcckt ist der Laden mit frischen Gem\u00fcsen und Kr\u00e4utern.\n\n\n Auch die Inhaber sind sehr nett und helfen gerne beim suchen.\n\n\n Einen Stern Abzug gibt es f\u00fcr die Tatasache, dass man nur bar zahlen kann. Hier gebe ich auch meinem Vorschreiben recht.\n\n\n Tipp: Was es hier nicht gibt hat der Asia Store in der Margrafenstr., den man zu Fu\u00df in 5min erreicht."
"Dropped in for a happy hour visit today and were super glad we did so.  What a cool place!  While it isn't the biggest place you will find, it is exactly the kind if place you would want to hang out with, either by yourself, with a friend, or a bunch of friends.  The atmosphere is hard to beat.  \n\nThe bartender( he might have been the owner/manager) was super attentive and understands what customer service is all about.  One guy asked him to make some shot ( he gave him a slip of paper with ingriedents) that he had had at some other bar.  It was supposed to be triple layered and when it didn't come out quite how the guy wanted it, he Goggled it and tried to replicate it for him.  It still wasn't quite what the guy wanted....I would have told him to just get a shot of tequila and man up!  We were amazed how patient he was and how genuinely intent on making that stupid drink the way the guy wanted it.   \n\nHe definitely took care of us and we will be back.  Looks like there are lots of possibilities, on lots of different days, for a good time here.\n\nNote to first timers:  Entering off of McDowell can be tricky. The McDowell entrance is not left turn friendly. It is located above the Pei Wei and Starbucks. The easiest way to enter seems to be off of 7th Ave.  Turn into the lot right after you pass McDowell.\n\nMovie during our Happy Hour: Escape From New York..love it!  The music in the place is awesome too."
"The entrance to Pure was mobbed with people. We had made previous arrangements with a staff member to get our large party (14, mostly girls) inside. It was nearly impossible with the poor line control.\n\nWe finally made it inside but were quite disappointed. The primary downstairs area was extremely packed and too dark. The open air dance floor upstairs was much better.\n\nI don't want to sound snobby, but... the bouncers seem to let everyone. There were also quite a few extremely drunk individuals that I would have expected to be escorted out, if anyone had been paying attention."
"What a HUGE disappointment. Came in a party of 18 and seated promptly. The service was impeccable and my good buddy who was celebrating his birthday had made it a annual bday brunch spot for the last couple of years. He highly recommended the lobster benedict saying it had blown his mind the first time. I don't take his recommendations lightly either, he has a refined taste pallet hah.\n\nWe literally had half our party order lobster benedict expecting the world because it sure as hell sounded great. Upon receiving my dish I was starved and surely thought anything that tasted semi decent would satisfy me. Boy was I wrong. The egg was COOKED through and the yoke did not break and ooze out as a proper benedict should. The piece of bacon served on top and I quote from a friend tasted like \""ASS\"". This is bacon we are talking about, how hard is it to mess up bacon!? Instead of a typical english muffin or some sort of bread the benedict was served on hash browns and the textures did not blend well at all. I could go on and on about how the dish conceptually and flavor wise went wrong. Bottom line it was a big FAIL. \n\nWe asked if the chef changed recently and the waiter confirmed that there was a change in the chef. Bring back the talent please. \n\nThe ambiance and service was great, but if you can't get the food right you could have ambiance and service for days and it won't matter at all."
"Incompetent and unprofessional.  I took my car in because it developed a miss, the kind typical of something wrong with the ignition system.  I specifically asked if they did computer diagnostics and they assured me they did.  They called me later with the results - said it needed the carburetor rebuilt for around $400.  I went over to pick up the car and decide what to do.  I asked to see a printout of the computer diagnostic so i could see if the ignition system had checked out OK.  He didn't have a printout.  When I asked more about their \""computer system\"" his answers got really weaselly.  I paid them the Diagnostic fee.  I didn't believe them and took the care to a different shop that I like but that was much farther away to have them check it.  They checked and said the problem was a bad spark plug that was all fouled and showed me the plug, it was a mess.  They had put in a new plug to replace it and they car ran fine.  They said it would probably foul it again because the valve stem seals were leaking.  They also said there was nothing wrong with the carburetor and the car ran great when I drove away.   I went back to the Shell station with the results and asked to speak to the owner.  Supposedly he wasn't there.  I came back later and the same guy was there and I finally pinned him down to at least admit he was in charge and showed him the results from the second shop and explained that with the 1 new $2 plug the problem was fixed.  Asked him how such a clearly bad plug, which I showed him, would not have literally jumped off the computer screen of his \""computer diagnostics\"".  He just try to BS his way around without answering.  I told him I thought they owed me my money back for their \""diagnosis\"" since it was so clearly wrong.  He refused to even consider it.    I wouldn't trust this place to wash my windows much less do any work on my car."
"Worst Mexican food ever. The coffee was disgusting, it tasted like water. I have to admit that the guacamole was good though.  But other then that, I do not recommend this place at all. The price you pay is not worth the food they serve you. I'd rather pay $5 more to eat at a buffet!"
"The windows and doors are boarded up. Apparently, it is closed!\n\nThere is no way to get any food. So, I would skip this one."
"What the!!!???\n\nGood pho in Vegas, at Treasure Island no less!\n\nThe Pho restaurant attached to the diner in TI was a nice alternative to everything fried. Obviously I have had better pho but this really was tasty although they are a little shady on the chicken.  I was happy to be eating something kinda plain and standard.  In short, it was the best eating experience of my stay in Vegas.  \n\nI do however have an abnormal affinity for soup."
"OK sushi. Tried it several times. When I'm shopping at Home Depot, Target or Pet Smart. I get a thing for sushi and cold Japanese beer. Conveniently located in the same parking lot of Home Depot. Every time, disappointed."
"This hotel is very kid friendly with the \""fun dungeon\"" and jousting show\nThe arcade games are a bit pricy and the show is expensive. The room are ok they are very small and the beds aren't that comfortable this hotel is definitely just a place to sleep not to hang out it"
"Please note: i am rating the MINI GOLF COURSE at the Leatherman Golf Learning Center and this review in no way has anything to do with this place as a golf learning institute.\n\nThe highlight of the course was that every hole did in fact have a hole to shoot for and that's how it got at least one star. \n\nRather than talk this out, i may have to bullet point my thoughts:\n-the turfs were torn up\n-none of the water traps were filled with water, although one of the holes was indeed waterlogged \n-one of the lights on the course had been smashed out, with the glass shards still just lying around it\n-some of the hole designs made no sense\n-no windmills or laughing clowns (not a real complaint)\n\nNow, i (just like any other reasonably decent human being) have nothing against making everything handicap accessible, however, when it comes to mini golf, there has to be a better system then simply removing two of the brick pieces from the walls of each hole. i am only assuming that is the reason that every hole had two equidistant holes in the walls. Does it count as a one stroke penalty if your ball goes through the handicap exit? Mini golf courses need walls.\n\ni can imagine that in it's prime, this course was not too shabby, but these days it's nothing but shabby. \n\nHowever, i do recommend the driving range. There is a coupon in the Entertainment Book for a free bucket of balls when you buy one, so that was fun. Not being an actual golfer, i don't know if there is a way to make a driving range bad? Maybe if there was a wall in front of you that sent the balls right back?"
Another one of my favorite brands. Whenever I'm in Vegas I have to stop by this store. Always have some good sales on some nice clothes. \n\nBen Sherman is dope!
"Just got home from dim sum with the family here. I come here for dim sum about once a month. It's one of the better dim sum places in vegas. The line can get pretty long, so we try to come around 11am. Today the line started getting long just after 11:15am. \n\nThe food off the dinner menu is good too, but the portions are small. Salt & Pepper Frog Legs is one of my favorite dishes here. Yup. I said FROG LEGS!! Soft like fish and sorta tastes like chicken."
"Great iced coffee! The chai iced Vanilla tea is also to die for. The place is not very big, but its its nice and they make good use of the space. I also enjoy all the local art work, it gives the space character... I will be back for sure! I wish the place was open late though... Oh well!"
"We haven't been back in a while due to their friendly but not so good service. They offer free refills on sodas and teas but usually don't bother to refill them during the meal, maybe only when they come to clean up, which they do as soon as they sense that you're about finished.\n\nI do have to say they've got one of the best egg rolls I've tasted anywhere, and their spring rolls were pretty good too. Plus they have actually have good tasting peanut sauce for the spring rolls.\n\nI always order either chicken or beef pho, while the g/f usually gets the vermicelli noodle bowls. I'd have to say their pho/broth is probably the best tasting and flavorful in the west valley for me. I ordered their Bun Bo Hue once though, and that was super oily so order at your own risk.\n\nAfter sampling a few other places, it looks like we'll be back to Pholicious before long."
"Mediocre, pretentious and overpriced, even by Las Vegas standards. Pedestrian presentation of decent steaks. Outrageous prices on the wine list. Go somewhere else."
"MUST to avoid. Confusing system, indifferent service, sloooooow, bland food."
"Love this place. I usually order for pick up and i usually make my own pizza. Grilled chicken with jalapeno. The crust and sauce are amazing. If you decide to dine in they have specials like 2 slices of cheese and a drink for around $5.95, I think? But the food is always good and service is always on point. I'm definitely a regular here."
"Started out with wedding soup that was so salty it was almost inedible. Asked for the house wine and was given a glass of wine that cost $9.00. (My fault, I should have asked, I guess.) Meals were OK, but nothing special. Even the bread was just so-so. My dinner partner and I both got entirely different meals, and we both experienced serious gastro-intestinal problems after our dinners."
"We enjoyed our meal, our service was excellent and most important to us our kids had a great time as well! The management was awesome when needed. Really have nothing but great things to say about dining in this establishment!"
"Totally underestimated Sambalatte at first. I remember my first time here. I went home with a headache, feeling jittery and shaking legs. Definitely the strongest coffee I've ever had! But soooo good!\n\nThey have a really cool atmosphere. Probably one of the best coffee shops in Vegas. I love coming here on my days off to relax, chit-chat a bit, drink my coffee or read a book. I always leave this coffee shop wired!\n\nOverall, I give Sambalatte 5 stars!"
Awful awful awful!!!!  I have never experienced such RUDE nurses or doctor in my life. I will never go back here again. I'm not sure how they have received positive reviews.
"We needed to have our old reverse osmosis system replaced but were having trouble finding a good price. The company we'd used to service our existing system for 10 years had become very pushy with sales pitches and gave us an outrageous quote on a new system. After calling several places, a family member recommended AHW. I'm so thankful! I was able to talk to a knowledgeable person right away and get an immediate quote. Their quote was the best I received. They then offered same day service and had someone out that afternoon. The installer, Jose, was very professional, called ahead to tell me exactly what time he'd arrive, and then arrived on time. He got the job done, was polite, and answered all our questions. We are very happy with our AHW experience and would highly recommend them to others. We look forward to an ongoing relationship with this fine company."
Great vet clinic. They have full service including a fabulous groomer.
"I hate The Hub. It is just obnoxious. It all like \""I wanna look like I have nothing, but wanna pay through the nose for it!\"". I mean the brand Deisel alone makes me irritated. It so \""I hate my life! Its so hard!\"". Also the staff prertend to know the product, but if you ask enough good questions you'll find they know nothing more than you could have deduced. Eww. Yuck. gag."
"If I have a Thai food craving and don't feel like driving to Lotus of Siam, Archi's satisfies the craving. You're not gonna find out of this world dishes, but the kind of dishes that have become staples of Thai food found in America. Service is always prompt and attentive and it's speedy when you're ordering takeout."
I don't typically eat here but my wife likes the slushies they offer.
"Kevin, Joe and Dave (All the mechanics) rock!  They are true masters at what they do. I brought my 26 year old, non US, oddball Landy diesel in for some work. They ordered the parts from back east and fixed it faster than planned, cheaper than quoted and did the job right. I have known Joe and Kevin from their days working for the local dealership and I would request that they were the only guys to touch my previous Defender when I took it for service there.\nTheir shop is clean, well ran and they offer the highest quality repairs of any Land Rover shop that I have ever used. There is nothing cheap about owning a Rover so you might as well get it done right the first time and this is the place!"
"Amazing bagels, it is by far the best bagel you can have. I always eat at least one before I even leave the store. \n\nIn Montreal, there is always a debate about who the best but for me I give my vote to Fairmount. In addition to the great taste, it remains soft even after I freeze it for a month."
"We caught quite a few fish, but the guide was pretty rude and full of himself.   Acted like it was a privilege for us to be fishing with him.\nWon't be going back.   Don't need an attitude on what should be a relaxing fish trip."
"This is NOT the place to go for your lunch hour. They are incredibly slow and they really don't care that they are. We were not ready to order when the waitress asked us the first time so she said she would come back in a few minutes. Yeah, more like 20 minutes!! \n\nI ordered the new bacon, mushroom and onion skillet and I loved it. It has an Alfredo sauce over potatoes, grilled mushrooms & onion, bacon and cheddar cheese. I know it sounds like a heart attack on a plate but it was so good. I had a blueberry muffin also and it came out hot with butter on the side. \n\nAlthough I was very pleased with the meal the reason I am giving such a low rating is for the service. I ran out of water and was looking for my waitress to ask for more. It took a really long time for her to show up again. It also took more than a half an hour for our food to come out of the kitchen after we ordered. With only an hour for lunch that is unacceptable."
"I called Action Pool Service to get my pool tile cleaned -- to remove the serious calcium deposits that I had.\n\nIt all started great -- Steven, who made the appointment for the inspection/quote, was great, and Jim, who did the inspection/quote was also very nice, so much so I forgave him for not showing up for his appointment twice (third time was the charm). At least he did call to cancel both times, and, again, was very friendly.\n\nAnyway, because of Jim and Steven I did end up accepting the quote and giving the green light.\n\nOne of the techs did the actual cleaning (his name escapes me right now) and initially it all went very well too -- they used bead blaster to perform the cleaning (rather than acid) and he did call me twice to keep me posted on the progress and run a few things by me.\n\nOnce the pool was filled back up, Jim came back to add salt and CYA back to the pool.\n\nAnd that's when things started going South.\n\nI told Jim that I noticed that the other tech had left quite a bit of bead blaster at the bottom of the pool, and I asked for it to be cleaned up. Jim's answer was that \""the in-floor cleaning system will take care of it in a day or two\"".\n\nWell, it didn't, and I emailed Steven back and asked for them to come and clean the very large amounts of bead blaster that was now covering the bottom of my (now filled) pool. That stuff is heavy and the in-floor system just doesn't have the power to remove it. And even if it did, it would just go into the pool filter and clog the heck out of it. And we all know pool filters are a pain to clean.\n\nSteven never responded and suffice to say I had to figure out a way to clean the stuff myself; the only option ended up being buying a robotic pool cleaner, that I literally had to run every day for TWO WEEKS to get all of the bead blaster out. Besides the hassle, those robotic pool cleaners aren't cheap. I had no need for a robotic cleaner until they filled my pool with bead blaster.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, I later also found a huge pile of bead blaster that had been left in a corner of my backyard, \""hidden\"" underneath some gravel. That has been equally a pain to remove, since you can't just hose that stuff off (it's extremely hard to get rid of).\n\nSo in the end, in spite of Steven and Jim's initial friendliness, they basically left me with a huge mess to clean up and more expenses. Had I known what I know now I would have definitely gone with somebody else, or done the job myself and saved both time and money."
"I don't think this location has as good of service as the location on Desert Inn and Durango but the food is great.  Our waitress was young, dumb and slow.  She pretended not to speak very good English and kept forgetting our sake, salads, etc.  This is the first time I've ever had a problem with service at Geisha, so I won't rate it too low.  Also, you should tell them it's someone in your group's birthday cause the Tempura Banana desert is YUM!"
"I've eaten at Hubbard Ave Diner many times.  Great pie, good service, average food, really inconsistent execution by the kitchen.  If they aren't busy, you've got a good chance to have your order arrive correct (as in get what you ordered as you ordered it) and hot.  If they are busy, forget it.  They really need to have an expediter in the kitchen."
"One place that I love coming to is this place. I know I can depend on this place for a good breakfast, lunch or dinner. I was flying out of Phoenix and I desperately needed food before I dealt with TSA, and flying. I ended up buying the power protein sandwich which was a very reasonable price. $5 in an airport for a good sandwich. I'm down!!\n\nAnyways they took my order and it took about five minutes to make my sandwich. The power sandwich had whole grain bread,  egg whites, white Vermont cheddar and lean ham. The ham and egg tasted so good. And the bread was very hearty and delicious. It made eating healthy be delicious. I really enjoyed my sandwich and it kept me full until lunch time!!"
"I found Heaven while walking down the Strip.\n\nThis place is AMAZING. It is nothing like my LVs back home! I was blown away. It was absolutely packed beyond belief as it was New Year's Eve, but I didn't mind. The staff looked a bit frazzled and maybe was a bit short when talking to them, but I understood, as there really may have been 600 people in here. Because of the crowds, it made it a bit easier to shop without feeling like you're being stalked. I knew exactly what I wanted and my purchase was quick and easy. The fact that both of us were carrying Vuitton may or may not have helped us get the sales associates' attention, but either way they were fantastic for such a busy time.\n\nI would advise any LV lover to swing by here if they get a chance, you won't be disappointed! Now every time I visit my usual LVs, I think back misty-eyed to such a magical place."
"Hmmmm.... Think I Would Rather Suck Down Your Colonoscopy Bag?\n\nIf you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.\n\nWow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.\n\nJust 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.\n\nSo we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....\n\nOrders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.\n\nChicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.\n\nBBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.\n \nThe food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.\n\nGo grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place. If you do decide to go, don't forget to bring your business card - it might be old enough to go up on the wall in 2032 - that is, assuming this place is around much longer."
Great service and food!\n\nLove the staff and the place.
"Good atmosphere, good food!"
"The 4-star rating is purely as compared to other buffets not as a comparative to a \""real\"" restaurant. \n\nAfter having been a good boy for months, I sucumbed to the temptation or rather the convenience of dining buffet style. \n\nAs far as buffets go, The Bellagio buffet is pretty good - although since it is food on an assembly line the taste is not as good as a sit down restaurant. \n\nThe buffet features the ubiquitous shrimp that are found at even the cheapest buffets and also some crab.\nOther than that, the fare includes: american, italian, chinese and japanese dishes. The Bellagio is a little lite on the vegetarian fare - but I guess they will eventually catch up to the current trend.   \n\nThe desserts are quite extensive, although none were outstanding (comparable to most upperscale hotel sunday brunches).\n\nProbably one of the better ones in Vegas."
"Admittedly I have a bit of a weak-stomach especially when it comes to my olfactory sensory system. I honestly had a hard time visiting this grocery store and as embarrassing as it is to admit, I  actually had to jump ship at the end. \n\nThat being said, they have  fabulous aloe juice ranging from $1.99-2.99 for a large bottle ( $2.99 is the price for a small bottle at Common Mkt/Trader Joe's). They have everything you could possibly need or want for Asian cooking. My boyfriend marveled at the cost of the shrimp (much cheaper than HT). I had the hardest time with the meat dept because of the scent combined with looking at pig intestine started to make me gag a bit...but if you aren't a big baby like me check it out!"
"Not to brag but I am  one of the lucky people to really have Xiaolong Bao in Shanghi at Yu Gardens. This place does a nice job, and the choices of fillings is really fun and not an option at the famous dumpling shop. The biggest difference though is the wrapper. Here they are too dry and often have a hole in them. Never the case in Shanghi. I also miss the sauce, black vinegar with ginger and sesame oil.\n  All criticism aside, I have never had any closer outside of China. It's American prices but it's in America. Shanghai's run $1 for 15."
"My stay has been horrible. First when I was checked in they kept my id. They did not bother to call to tell me that they had it so I found out the next day when I drove across town to pick up a rental truck and had to go back to get my id.\n\nSecond, there where no towels in the room at all. We were unable to shower until the next day when I had to go to the front desk and get towels.\n\nLastly I have been in my room for two hours and they just called and asked to stop slamming doors. I have not left the room so I am unsure how I would slam doors.\n\nThe rooms are outdated, the bed mattresses are horribly stained and the bathroom is disgusting.\n\nIt is cheap but not cheap enough for all of this."
"Just a quick side note:\nI went to the location on Harmon and Koval.\n\nHad there been a half-star rating, they would have gotten that. The only reason I'd give them that is because they were able to schedule my family member in so quickly. I received a call from someone at their place of business returning my call from a day before. I left my cell phone number on the voicemail, yet they called my workplace on the phone I had placed the original call from. They had gotten my cell phone number wrong and admitted so on the phone when I asked what number they had for me. No big deal, we moved on. She got my family member's information and insurance numbers and the usual information they get when they book an appointment. She said they accepted the insurance and we could come in the next day for an appointment. \nI arrived with my family member on the appointment day a few minutes after noon. The appointment was for 12:40, so we finished the paperwork that we had already begun at home the night before (the office faxed it to me). The office staff was given the ID and insurance cards, and they gave them back shortly after. They were nice, but from there on out, clearly didn't have their stuff together and it became apparent to me they were very noticeably incompetent. My family member has a unique insurance where, if someone has never dealt with the company before, they may run into a snag, at most. Let me preface this by saying, they have NEVER had an experience such as what happened at this place nor anything even close to it. The insurance-verifying person has never had a problem until this place.\n\nFrom the time we sat down a few minutes after noon until about 1:30, the office staff was STILL unable to verify the insurance. HUH!?!?!  I even made an effort to call and be on hold with the insurance company for 15 minutes to speak to someone, hand a member of the front office staff my cell phone, then still be told that they couldn't use the info that the girl was giving them from the insurance company. Even the insurance girl was confused as to why they weren't able to find out what they needed. The original appointment setter and person who handles their insurance issues \""works from home and doesn't come to the office.\"" So I couldn't even speak to anyone who normally dealt with these issues and whom I spoke to the day before. I could go on, but no one would want to even read about my full experience, yet experience it themselves. Needless to say, we never saw the doctor, and after almost an hour and a half, we left. My family member went there for debilitating pain, and sat in a chair the whole time with no regard as to how long they were having to wait for the run-around that we got. I will NEVER recommend this place. It's sad I can't even review the doctor himself since we never even got that far. If your front office staff can't get it together, maybe you should hire new ones. They lost a new patient and a good referral for the possibility of others.\n\nIf Dr. Lanzkowsky sees this, it would have been nice to meet you and see if you could help with my family member's pain."
"Great place to end up on a Friday and/ or Saturday night. I staggered in here after a Checkers hockey game and listened to a cover band with a few buddies. \n\nVery conveniently located in the upstairs portion of the EpiCenter, the interior layout of this uptown location is pretty snazzy. I've been out to the Wild Wing in the university area and was surprised to see (what seemed like) a little more square footage at this location. The food and service are pretty good here for what few times I've been. The atmosphere is very much like any other low-lighted bar. The crowd varies throughout the week and weekend, especially on the weekends when live bands are booked.\n\nIn addition to food, I am always pleased with a late-night restaurant that carries over drink specials into a Friday and Saturday. This is kind of a big deal if I have a DD and want to get a few. \n\nOverall, a great restaurant for late night, but also any time of day really. Pretty sure they validate parking also."
"I am completely disappointed in this establishment today. 30 minutes in the drive thru line. Then the kid was an ass when we asked what was taking so long, he said we are understaffed and busy! As we finally get to the window we wait 15 more minutes for 2 iced birthday cakes and a small watermelon! And look through the window as the staff are all just standing around looking at one another. I usually love this place but man it's summer in Az you think you would be staffed for these hot days!!!"
"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\nA tenant said they had some small roaches in the kitchen of one of my apartments. I was out and about and close to this walmart. Rather than park, walk in and search around I figured I'd call their number to see if they carried Combat Roach Killer which seems to do the job.\n\nI call, phone rings and rings about 15 times...finally a lady picks up and I ask if they carry \""Combat Roach Killer\"" for killing roaches.\n\nShe says \""no\"" in an annoyed voice.\n\nI ask, \""Do you carry any roach and insect killer?\""\n\n\""No\"".\n\nOk, so I guess that's that, thinking I will probably have to go to home depot later because I know they carry it.\n\nI get home prior to hitting home depot and check the website of walmart.com to see if they carry what I was looking for.\n\nNot only do they carry roach killer, but this location carries EXACTLY what I was looking for, \""Combat Roach Killer\"" and it's in stock.\n\nIt was around 1pm on 10/25/14 when I called up and got a nasty woman on the phone who didn't care or want to help. \n\nIf any manager is reading this, please fire her.\n\nPathetic."
An interesting concept.  All items nicely packaged.  Self checkout that works well.  Would return.
"'O' my heavens!\n\nWith many of the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas, O rises to the occasion with an amazing show.  The setup is similar to the others in town with many different talents showcased for enthused audiences.  With the water aspect being the center theme, it opens up a multitude of stage variations.  One moment it is a solid stage... then next it's an open pool of water.  Incredible to see!\n\nI was given the opportunity to experience the new VIP suites.  Pretty incredible with a perfect view.  Chocolate covered strawberries and truffles are waiting for you!  You have a waitress there to assist the entire evening.  She is there for any drink or food orders.  She was so polite and friendly.  Her service was impeccable! \n\nO is definitely one of my favorites and would love to see it again!"
"I'm not sure what happened when my husband & I ate here, but it was the worst food we've ever had at a Mexican spot. I'm really confused by all of the great reviews, I consider myself a total fan of mexican food, my Hubby actually calls me his ''White mexican''. The food was very small portioned, flavorless, and I couldn't even finish his taquitos & I was still hungry. We paid $4.50 for the ''special'', and got 2 TINY dry taquitos. No lettuce, guac, or anything to go with them. I don't know, maybe we went there on their worst day. Won't be going back though, and I'm in that shopping center all the time."
"Beautiful place, great ambiance, excellent service. Everything I tried was great: White Ceviche, Croquetas, Marinated Olives, Pintxo Chorizos, Beef and Cheese. Got a pitcher of red sangr\u00eda. The waiter seaid it would get us ~5 glasses but it was a lot more than that. My favorite: Pintxo Chirizos: I've been looking for this kind of Spanish Chorizo for a long time! The chocolate cake dessert was also great. Got my two long favorites, so I have to give 5-stars. :)"
"I was looking at the graphs which showed I give more positives in my reviews than negatives.  Granted, I admit I would always rather be positive than negative.  Still, I like to be able to be clear with my self about my reviews and the standards I use for how many stars I give.  With this Walgreens, I can give four stars and know why.\n\nFirst of all, my review does not include in anyway the pharmacy, just the rest of the store. Yes, there is one employee who is devoid of any personality.  The rest of the employees I have encountered have been a fairly nice group of people who help me find what I am looking for.   Things are fairly organized so stuff isn't to hard to find. No, not a corner of Heaven but a nice place to go in. \n\nI especially want to compliment the Assistant Manager whose name I can't recall.  I wanted to buy quite few of a Walgreens generic product to save money.  When I asked when there'd be more, this gentleman took the time to ask me how much I needed and why.   He offered to double the next order so There'd be the quantity I wanted the next Tuesday, a rather nice touch for a customer he didn't know.  Not that I am a doubting Thomas, but when I went in the following Tuesday, I didn't know what to expect.  He followed through!   \n\nAnother plus is this store is easy to get in and out of.  For any one who shops on Bell Road,  you know this is a real plus."
"Not too bad but not the worst. I would definitely look elsewhere next time.\n\nWe tried to get a \""reservation\"" with AMEX concierge which works in about any place in NYC. No luck, they wouldn't even answer the phone for them. Like most bouncers these people seemed miserable and on edge, we don't want to fight you just go in.. haha\n\nDoor charge, obviously, i believe it was around $30 (only like $10 for girls that night). Which is OK but Jesus give us a break on the drinks. This place was stupid expensive. My time was ruined by thinking about how much i was spending. \n\nAs far as crowded goes. i would say 80% filled, not horrible believe it or not, i was able to walk somewhat. \n\nNot too much going on inside. The place was forgettable on the whole. The only noteworthy parts were the walk in (escalator)  and the elevator ride out."
"AVOID THIS TOURIST TRAP: high prices, poor service, mediocre food, boring menu.  Save your money for the slot machines (and not at the Bellagio).\n\nOn our way to Olive's, we asked some Bellagio workers for directions.  One pointed us in the right direction.  But, as we walked away, his coworker made an insulting wisecrack (unbelievably rude).\n\nThe hostesses at Olives were friendly and helpful. The waiter, on the other hand, was simply indifferent. He offered helpful information only when directly questioned. At these prices, I expect more - professionalism. at the very least.  What we got was some burned-out character, who only came alive when offering us desserts (and then, only half-heartedly.)\n\nAt fine restaurants, I look for creativity in the menu, especially the appetizers. The menu completely lacked creativity - no interesting appetizers, no interesting entrees, not even an interesting soup.  (Potato soup, really? Is this Luby's?)   The central theme in the menu appeared to be food that can be cranked out relatively quickly in mass quantities (so they can hurry the customer out the door).\n\nWe were disappointed with the entrees.  The steak - terrible.  The short ribs - poor.  The chicken - mediocre.  The branzini (fish) - okay (nothing to write home about).  Again, at these prices, you expect fine cuisine.  Instead, you get overpriced mediocre food.  \n\nWe all declined dessert.  Nobody at the table seemed willing to throw good money after bad.  Nor should you.\n\nAs we left, other unlucky tourists stood outside, waiting to be seated.  I wanted to warn them to stay away (but didn't want to make a scene).  So, I'm warning you: stay away from Olives."
"Love BevMo's 5 cent wine sale! And now it is all the time and you can even mix and match. What a great way to try new wines! \nI only wish this store was larger. The one at Tempe Marketplace is bigger and had a better selection, but it farther away for me."
"Have a beer, play some pacman, and eat cheese fries.  Sounds pretty grand to me, I really like hanging out with a group of guy friends here and just kicking it for a couple of hours.  You have to watch out for drunken game hogs that take over certain games for hours at a time, blowing dollar after dollar, while others sit and wait in line.  That is what happened the last time we were here.  My friend and I waited on a game for like twenty minutes before this middle aged drunk backed off, and I am pretty sure that he was about to pee himself.  Besides that, it is a great place for bdays and guy's night out."
"Soooo much fun!!  A friend and I were visiting Charlotte for leisure and thought that the Charlotte NC Tours segway tour would be a fun way to explore downtown.  Man, my friend and I had so much fun!  Rod was an excellent tour guide.  He was really knowledgeable about the city's history and he had such a fun personality!  Lil' Rod (not to be confused with Rod), instructed us how to operate the segways.  He was also well informed and made us feel confident on the segways within minutes.  \n\nWe opted for the The Victorian Era - Center City - Historic 4th Ward tour and enjoyed every minute of it.  My friend and I were lucky because the other people that were supposed to come on the tour didn't show up, so it was just my friend, Rod the guide and myself.  Very personalized!  All of the staff that we met were very friendly and left us with a wonderful impression of the city.  Loved it!"
Filthy line. You would think they would be more concerned with the appearance of the kitchen(line) sense it is visible. Its makes you question the sanitation. I won't be coming back.
"I made a mistake by booking a rental with Fox on Orbitz. Well, I made 2 mistakes. The first was booking with Fox, the second was for not double checking the date I scheduled it for (which happened to be in 3 weeks, not sure how that happened). \n\nI understand that I made the mistake in the first place, but the events that followed prompted me to make sure that I tell everyone I know to avoid Fox.\n\nSince we were planning a drive to San Diego, we arrived at pickup at 5am. There was no counter agent (as expected that early) so I headed down to the garage for pickup...but there was no one there either. I had to wait ten minutes for the grubby lot attendant to \""help\"" me. After we were told that the reservation was made for the wrong date and there was nothing he could do about it, he told me to \""call Orbitz\"" and change the reservation. I cancelled my original reservation and attempted to make a new one, but by then they were out of cars (which they weren't because said lot attendant said they had plenty).\n\nI tried calling their 24 hour customer service number and they did not pick up. I went back down after finally being able to make a reservation online and then they said that it takes 2 hours to populate in the system.\n\nHad to cancel that reservation. By now, it is 6 am  and the counter agents still hadn't arrived, but I was able to get thru and make a reservation on their reservation line. \n\nThen, back downstairs to pick up the car since it was now 6:20 and the Fox employees still hadn't shown up for work. The lot attendant then told me that he could do nothing for me since it was after 6, and the counter agents were now on duty. \n\nExcept they weren't. They were gabbing in the garage.\n\nI go back upstairs. Only to find out that all car rental companies have changed their policy to: if you don't have a credit card you're screwed. \n\nI guess people steal their cars all of the time, so the standard $250 deposit they usually take from my debit card wasn't enough. \n\n...and the worst of it? They were going to do a credit check. Like I want a point taken off of my credit score to rent a car. So I left and thought it would be better to chance a trip across the desert in my 15 year old Buick.\n\nWe made it and had a blast.\n\nTo sum it up, yeah, I made a mistake, but Fox's customer service is absolutely horrible. If you are in a rush or don't want to have a credit card, AVOID FOX AT ALL COSTS."
"My family and I have been dining at Sakana on Elliot for at least a decade and for the most part, have been very satisfied with our experiences. In fact, we would call it one of our \""go-to\"" places. Over the last 6 months or so however, that has changed and as of today, I will not go back. Craving fresh sashimi and being consistently disappointed has not been good for my loyalty nor my pocket book. Today, my son and I tried yet again, wanting to give Sakana another chance. Today the albacore was fishy and mushy, some of the other fish was \""borderline\"" and my cucumber roll lacked any substance or finesse.We were told nothing would be done in terms of compensation (i.e. taking something off the tab) because we did not inform them in enough time. Poor quality food, poor service...big bummer."
"The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.\n\nI still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point."
"One dear friend calls this place \""Whole Paycheck\"" and it does add up quite a bit. Like Kermit says though  \""it's not easy being green\"".\n\nHowever, I do appreciate any business that is willing to be different and to provide a better way of living- give them plenty of kudos simply for that fact. It's not only food, some people don't know WF has a foundation that helps projects that life communities out of poverty, or a Local Producer Loan Program that gives low interest loans to small productions, or support wind and solar power farms to offset 100% of their electrical usage.\n\nFor someone who has food allergies, this place is their savior. For some, it is wholesome foods they can make a change with and I'm rooting for anyone who wants to live consciously.  For people like me though, I come for select things since I can't afford to go fully microbiotic/organic, but I like to keep my home and foods as natural as possible. Going all natural in a world like today, specially in a city like Vegas isn't so easy. It's not like back home where LA has an abundance of big farmers markets and natural food stores to chose from. \n\nFirstly, toothpaste. This is the only place that carries Jason products and their Sea Fresh is the only toothpaste I use. I will not put any other toxic brand in my mouth. Never ever again. I love that they have a variety of natural products and I tend to buy things like shampoo here when I can't get to places like Lush.\n\nI buy mostly from the produce section. It's fresh, it's not too badly priced considering its natural and I find things here I have difficulty finding anywhere else- gold beets, chanterelle mushrooms, brussel sprouts fresh on the stalk, heirloom mini tomatoes,etc.\n\nTheir beer selection isn't wide, but it makes up for in selections. Often times when I am looking for a limited edition, I can find it here. In particular- Dechutes limited like Abyss and Jubel are often available.\n\nDeli is okay. I do love WF deli but this one compared to the Cali ones  and even the other Vegas branches has the most limited selection of the ones I've been in. It's still good quality, just sometimes I'm looking for a particular WF deli item I'm hankering for and this one does not have it. There's this quinoa salad I loved in La Jolla and I've seen it only at the LVB store. I also like their spicy soba noodles, rotisserie chicken and curry salad. \n\nEverything else is hit and miss. Some dry goods, breads, meats, cheeses, etc. I can find cheaper at other natural markets so it's about buying what is a reasonable deal here or getting things here that I cannot find elsewhere (black forest bacon for example). .  Check out the under $3 basket of cheese! I think this is great for a small dinner party since you can sample a load of cheeses that normally come in big $10+ hunks. \n\nAny serious and honest cook can't really denounce a place like this. For the their selection and a honorable mission I am a fan, even when it hurts my wallet."
"Went to Caramba's for dinner.  This was our first time and we went on the recommendation of friends.\n\nFirst impressions.  When we walked in, about a 1/2 dozen tables were occupied.  The restaurant was VERY clean.  Lots of tables, no kitsch decor, and an order/pick up at the counter type set up.   \n\nThe lady at the counter was friendly and took our order w/ no problems.  We asked about ordering chips (they are listed on the on-line menu), and the lady said they were included, and gave us a couple of bowls of chips along w/ our drink cups.\n\nThey have a salsa bar with several different salsas available.  Medium smooth (hot sauce), medium chunky, hot, fire roasted, and pico de gallo.\n\nThe fire roasted salsa and the medium smooth were good, but nothing special.  The chips however, were well past their prime (stale).\n\nWe ordered a #2 combo plate (2 hard beef tacos), #6 combo plate (red chile burrito), and a bean and cheese burrito.\n\nThe food came fast and hot.  That's about the only good things I can say.  The red chile burro had a lot of meat and grease, but no flavor.  The red chile it self was very thin and watery.  The rice was bland.  The beans had the flavor of being fresh out of a can.  The tacos were also packed w/ meat, once again without flavor.  The same bland rice and beans accompanied the tacos.\n\nMy son ate about 1/2 of the bean and cheese burrito, and didn't want to take the rest home, and I didn't blame him.  He's pretty easy to please when it comes to a bean and cheese burritos, and he didn't like the beans either.\n\nMaybe if we would have had one of their margaritas or cheap beer that many people rave about we would have liked it more.\n\nI would rate almost any of \""berto\"" places above Caramba when it comes the the flavor of the food.  I would rather have traveled down Bell Road to Mixteca.\n\nMy advice, if you want fresh, tasty, fast Mexican food.  Go to the nearest Carolinas.\n\nI'm giving 2 stars, the restaurant was spotless, and the iced tea was fresh and very good."
This place has zero customer service. They lost my clothes after I confirmed they had them. The owner looked at me and told me there was nothing to do. She is miserable... DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!
"We went to Triple George to celebrate this Father's Day and a 40th birthday party. My friend suggested the Grill due to a previous visit and the fact that they are supposed to have great steaks. We made reservations for 8-mind you 8 steak hungry, very thirsty, ready to spend and have a good time 8! From our first order of drinks, two martinis had to be sent back after waiting 20 minutes. After ordering some more drinks we waited another 30 minutes for our drinks and all 4 of the martinis tasted different. We all ordered dirty martinis and we all taste tested that all were different. \nAfter waiting so very long for drinks, we ordered some appetizers. Mediocre presentation and already bad service, it was like our table had done something wrong we were not being attended to. You cannot share the calamari because it comes in a french fry scoop and the artichoke spinach dip was cold on the inside, and do not count on sharing the $13 seared Ahi because for that price you get 4 lil strips!\nSo now we have been here just a little over an hour and we are hungry. We ALL order steaks, due to my buddy's recommendation. Orders where placed and thank goodness we brought a bottle of wine because most of us could not finish our martinis and did not want to wait for another 30 minutes for a drink.\nAfter 25 minutes of placing our order, the waitress (whom we barely saw most of our experience) brought to our attention THEY ARE OUT OF STEAKS!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! It took 25 minutes to tell all 8 of us this!!! If we would have known we would have already been eating steak at a real grill!!!\nMy buddy was embarrassed, and we tried making light of it like ordering \""fish n chips\"" at a steak house. Basically our waitress said that they would give us smaller cuts and some of us due to Father's Day and the Birthday switched so that they can have what they wanted...ridiculous! The ONLY good service that we received was the gentleman serving us water and the gentleman clearing the plates. They even laughed with us as how bad this situation was.\nBy the time they brought us our smaller cuts and dinner we had been waiting since we ordered our dinner an hour! By now it seem that they are closing and we just want to get out of there. All of our steaks where fatty and nervy and most of us didn't even finish our meals. I feel sorry for the Dad's and our Birthday girl as this was a total waste of time and money.  \nThey maybe allot of changes on Freemont but if anything needs a change it is Triple George Grill!!! Way over priced, bad service, and they may be out of STEAKS...BEWARE!!!"
Love this place. The burgers are tasty & they're sliders so you can try a couple different ones. I had the buffalo chicken & the BBQ burger. Very good. The fries were nice & crispy. Trendy decor. Definitely worth another trip :)
"Good boba with a wide variety of flavors and juices to add to your mix. If you're in the area and appreciate a good boba,  definitely consider stopping by!"
"It's always busy the many times we'd come here.  Last night was no exception.  Since we didn't have reservations, we took the next available seats which were at the bar.  My friend got the New Amsterdam which is a burger topped with pastrami, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese.  I was full and was too busy watching a basketball game after I claimed my free beer upon check-in that I didn't realize my friend had the burger split so we can share fries and a burger.  He asked for truffle mayo to dip the fries in and it was great.  The best part of the evening was the food came out in no more than 10 minutes!  The friend was going on and on about the food, I didn't touch it except for the fries - I was too focused on the game.  He finished my half too - I guess he was saying it was real good?\n\nThe other times I've been here, I had the Organic Chicken Pot Pie and Shepherd's Pie - comfort food!  Hot, filling and delicious.  Angus Sliders were pretty good and juicy.  The Corn Dog Puppies come with fries and we order it everytime I'm here with my family.  But what I always get is their Lobster Rolls with slaw and kettle chips - one of my favorite lobster rolls in Vegas.  Nice big chunks of lobster on a buttery toast.  Absolutely delish!\n\nOf course, it won't be a pub unless they have beer.  They have a great selection of beers here.  Stella, Carlsberg, Blue Moon, Pabst, Red Stripe, Amstel, Heineken, Bud, etc.  They have gluten-free beer too.\n\nThere's one item that I'm crushed that they took off the menu called Ninja Snacks.  Wontons filled with Nutella and bananas and you dip them in caramel.  It was amazing!  I guess I'd have to copy it and make Ninja Snacks at home."
"Wow. I have been going to this practice for 3-4 years. I have had some troubles with them in the past but this is the kicker of them all. I just called and explained to the person at the front desk that I have been having some breast pain and didn't know if I should come in earlier than my Oct. 1st  Well Woman exam. Her response was, \""Well, if you come in early you will have to pay for an office visit.\"" I said, \""well if I wait I'll just talk to her about it at my Well Woman.\"" Her reply, \""if you talk to her about it then, then you will be charged extra.\"" My reply, \""just for talking about it??\"" Her reply, \""yup, I don't know what to tell you. Just go to your primary care physician.\"" I then explained to her that this was a gynecological issue... No response. Her overall tone was brash, rude, and short. Did I mention uncaring.\n\nUnbelievable. Never, ever have I been so appalled. A woman calls and says she has breast pain and isn't sure if she should come in and this is how the front desk responds!! I'm outraged and waiting for someone to call me back from the office. I think Dr. Johnstone has the right to know how the front desk is treating her patients."
"Not the best, but better than most.\n\nOk, to be honest, the first time I came here, it wasn't really by choice.  I was actually headed to the place next door (if you've been here, you know what restaurant I'm talking about) but my reservation was \""denied.\""  So, being hungry and unwilling to wait 2 hours to be seated, the wife and I reluctantly walked over to Seoul Oak.  We were one of two tables seated.  At 7pm.  On a Friday.  I had second thoughts, but...\n\nThe waitress was so polite and helpful, we decided to give it a shot.  And we were impressed.  We ordered off the all you can eat menu and then proceeded to stuff ourselves silly.  The side dishes seemed never-ending!  The big bone kalbi is a must, though the meat could be served thicker.  My favorite is the spicy pork, which has slightly sweet notes as you start eating, but the heat builds and next thing you know you had two bowls of rice.  \n\nThe food was delicious and relatively authentic (compared to the \""Americanized\"" or more trendy eateries).  We even took a kid from Korea (on a later visit) who said the food was like how his mom makes.  Seriously.  But on a recent visit (maybe two or three weeks ago) we noticed that some of the menu items tasted differently.  Maybe a new cook?  Maybe they just changed the recipes?  It wasn't bad, but a surprise.  \n\nThe place is very unassuming, and I'm not sure if they even have a sign (in English...if you're going West to East on Spring Mtn., I know there is a sign in English).  But come here for straight up Korean food that is filling and tasty."
"I always get nervous when it's time to service my car, as I don't know much about what's goin on under the hood. So I have to find professionals who I can trust, feel comfortable with. Gene is one of those guys. He's gonna lay it to me straight. If I need something  he'll say it, if not, he'll tell me not to worry about it right now. Now, That's what you need in a mechanic...the truth! Go see Gene, you'll thank me later."
The desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size.  I've had better Japanese bakery items elsewhere.
This place is shady. I went in one week and asked for a basic hand car.. $25.. Okay a little steep but fair. Went in a few weeks later the attendant tries to charge me $34.99. I told him that's bs and that the website doesn't even advertise it as such. His response was that management doesn't tell him about these things.. what?! \n\nOh yeah not to mention the car was already pulled up to be dried from the time I walked from my car to the cash register. One man washing the whole car? Hard to believe.
"I have been using this facility for several years.  The doctor's service has been fine, however the office has continually gotten worse.  When calling the office it is usually a minimum wait of 20 minutes.  Several times I have been disconnected.  I feel they need to get better or more office workers who appreciate a persons time."
"You know how they have all those television commercials saying, \""If you have a job, we'll put you in a car?\""  This is supposed to be regardless of credit history or location of said job.  I took it for what it was worth, and provided a legitimate job offer to them, one with a starting salary of $55,000/yr, in the door.  I know I have a bad credit rating, as I am still recovering from filing a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy just over 2 years ago, so I am expecting a higher interest rate, which I will have no problem paying to re-establish my credit rating.\n\nI was told that my possible trade-in car wasn't worth much as a trade-in, but if I could come up with $1,000 as a down payment, they would be willing to waive the trade-in requirement and pre-approve me to get into a newer car.  I took the salesman at his word and found a third party individual who was in dire need of a car, and he bought my car for over $1,000.  I called up my insurance company to put in notice that I was purchasing a newer car and needed to upgrade my State minimum to full coverage.  My premium was duly increased, but since I was still covered until the middle of July, I didn't have to make any payments until next month, so all is well so far.\n\nI find out my loan was approved by the bank, but there was a small hiccup:  The bank would not release the funds to the dealer until the first day of my new job.  The new job starts on June 6th, 2011, and the dealer's owner decides at the last moment that he doesn't want to approve the deal because, Heaven forbid, the new job is in Washington, DC...700+ miles away from the middle of nowhere.  The dealer is afraid that just because I have a job offer, it doesn't mean I have been hired, and if I take their 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis to Washington, D.C. and am unable to pay for my car, they have no way of getting their car back.\n\nSo I am now left out in the cold, without a car from O'Brien, without a car that was actually running because I had let someone else purchase it from me, expecting to get a newer car, and now I have to take a bus or train to Washington, DC with just a duffle bag full of clothes and $1,000 in my pocket.  Thanks O'Brien, your false advertisements made such a difference in my life.  So where's the fine print saying that the customer's job offer has to be within 150 miles of the dealer?"
"So, if I were thrashed and needing food like NOW, I'd give it better stars. It was sub-par ingredients thrown onto a plate and cost boyfriend and I about $15. \n\nHe got the Nacho Supreme. It's comparable what you'd get at a Little League snack bar. Chips, \""cheese sauce\"", dry shredded chicken, olives, and jalapenos. Let's say the only thing gone from the plate at the end of the meal were the chips. \n\nI got the \""chicken and salsa\"" burrito. It was mostly shredded chicken (which was dry, by the way), mixed in with some salsa (very spicy), about 10 strips of shredded lettuce, and unmelted shredded cheese. The tortilla was the best part. \n\nDon't think we'll be going back."
"So I finally went out and experienced this valley staple that so many recommended to me.  My thoughts are summed up by the two star yelp description; Meh, I've experienced better.  What am I missing here? This food is not very good.  I guess if you like big portion's I do not), then that would be a positive note for this restaurant.  \n\nMy companion and I ordered a few different menu items, including the Chile Relleno, a Chimichanga and beef taco.  Let us start with the beef taco.  The appearance actually looked good. Crispy taco shell with colorful lettuce, tomato and cheese all over and the beef was decently cooked.  Unfortunately, the bottom of the taco had broken apart from the amount of oil, which make it hard to eat, but not bad.  The chimichanga was huge and covered with what seemed like three different sauces, and way too much of all three.  The chimi itself was not crunchy and totally lacking in flavor, most of it went un eaten.  \n\nI left the Chile Relleno description till the end, because this was nothing short of funny.  I have had Chile Relleno around fifty times in my life, minimum.  Never, ever ever, have I seen a plate of Chile Relleno look like this. You need to picture a football sized shell of some white substance with a plate of melted cheese below it. Seriously, it was bizarre and complete disgusting, dish was left completely untouched.  I am unsure how the kitchen lets a dish leave looking like that, totally revolting.\n\nAnyways, I am on my lonesome on this review, based on the fact there was an hour wait tonight on a Sunday and you cannot even get into the parking lot.  Go figure. I will not be back."
"I stopped for lunch on Wednesday of this past week and ordered Crispy Noodle Chicken Chow Mein.  The chicken in the chicken chow mein was not chicken.  It was long pieces of light and dark meat with connective tissue that made it very, very strange looking and nothing like any chicken meat I've ever seen.  The owner came out and I asked him what is this.  I said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners.\n\nI will never go back there again."
"Burnt garlic toast. Oh there's supposed to be garlic on that? Decent wings but half of the 1 pound plate was comprised of batter \""nuggets\"". And the pie. Uncooked soggy dough crust. Extra napkins provided to soak up the grease on this half baked abomination. Service was abysmal too. Do you think that when 3 of 5 have left the place we might want the check and aren't going to stick around for dessert? Sorry I just cannot recommend this place to anyone."
When this store opened in 1998 it was clean and had good clientele. Now it's dirty and overcrowded. A lot of garbage people shop there. I always see people getting purses stolen inside and out of store. I feel this store is unsafe. I think the dynamics of the neighborhood have changed. I will shop elsewhere and pay more for my own safety. Walmart also is non union and pays their employees low wages and doesn't give them good benefits. They are a greedy company based out of Arkansas that pushes made in USA and everything is made in china from slave labor. Walmart is from Arkansas and has their mentality. Exploit people and keep them down. I won't frequent SAMs club that is owned by walmart. I would rather pay a little more for products at companies that care about their employees and customers.
"I had the jambalaya and it was very good. GF had the fish and pasta, she loved it. Only problem was that we sat outside and a bee was bothering us.\n\notherwise the drinks are great, the food was plentiful, and the atmosphere was very calm!"
Excellent house turned restaurant. Great sandwiches! Great mac and cheese! A variety of beers which we didn't try today but plan to. Will definitely be back!
"I come here a lot out of convenience and because I adore most of the people working there. The staff at this Starbucks are a huge perk to coming here. They're just wonderful people. I can't stand the parking situation because people either don't know how to park in a small lot or don't pay attention to the DO NOT ENTER sign and come in through the exit to block everyone else in. Also, getting out the lot sucks too because sometimes you can't see both ways with cars parked on the street. Aside from the lot, I find this Starbucks to be a bit smaller, but I like the layout and I enjoy grabbing coffee or a snack here."
"The carne asada tacos are definately worth while!!! Large size corn tortilla, good amount of meat a d great flavor! They seen to have a good selection of other authentic Mexican food! Will go again"
"My mouth has a weird aftertaste. It could of been the cockroach that scurried across the floor and ended up in my burger. Free wings on Monday night football. That's cool. \nCheap beer. They raised over$1,000 for a nonprofit one night for local teens in need of help. That's cool. We are in Wickenburg"
"it's a very romantic beautiful spot at night, especially when the music is on. took some vedios and still feel excited when replaying it at home."
"Closest thing to excellent Korea food in PHX (that I've tried).\n\nI've been to 4 other Korean restaurants around town and this is the only one that I have been back to more than once.  I'd say we've hit this place 6 times since they opened.  This is comparable to some of the Korean we've had in Japan (yes I know, weird, but the Japanese love Korean food), New york and Seattle (big Korean community). \nFirst of all, this place hits a chord with me because it is not a cook-it-yourself barbeque place.  While the grill on the table is fun and all, I'd rather spend my time chatting with family/friends, downing Soju and Hite and chomping on spicy squid, bi bim bap and seafood pancake.\n\nKiller dishes include the aforementioned dolsot bi bim bap (google it if you don't know it), spicy squid with pork, seafood pancake, dumplings, all manner of tofu soup (with egg of course), the standard bbq (bulgogi/kalbi, etc) and of course the lovely, lovely refillable sides (kimchee, seaweed, apple salad, I could go on...).\n\nCold Hite (beer), not a bad selection of soju (sweet-potato liquor), and refillable drinks for the kids.  In my mind, you just can't go wrong.\nService was lacking.  They were understaffed on the last two visits and had a help wanted sign up.  Still, the food made the wait and lack of attention worth it.  They are 1 waiter away from making it really work.\n\nCons - Its cold in here.  My kids always want to wear their fleeces or a sweater (even in the summer).  Not that cheap.. especially if you like to hit multiple dishes.  For a family of 4, we usually do 3 dishes with beers and we're out the door at $80+.  Not crazy, but its not cheap.  Service.  Last few times, they needed 1 or 2 more staff to make it shine.\n\nPros - The food, the food, the food.  Need I say more?"
"My wife and two kids (ages 2 and 4) came here for a 10th anniversary celebration vacation. Couldn't really complain much. Room was nice, housekeeping was considerate (picked up our kids toys and placed them nicely on the cabinet). On our first day, they delivered milk and cookies for the kids for free.\n\nLocation is okay; probably a great location for a business trip. There isn't much downtown for kids so while the hotel certainly accomodated us well, the surrounding business don't really make much of an effort to cater to families.\n\nMaybe we got lucky but we booked the hotel with a special summer promotion they were running and the price ended up being the cheapest of the major downtown hotels. Some of the bad reviews seem to suggest this hotel is expensive so I could understand how my expections might be higher if I paid a lot more. \n\nAs other reviewers have stated, book the hotel directly through their website instead of Expedia, Orbitz, etc. If you do that and sign up for their rewards program, the wifi is free.\n\nThey have a pool but it's outdoors. \n\nWe did self-parking at a garage nearby which saved us about $10 per day compared to the hotel's valet parking. It's convenient to buses and the Metro."
"Situated right on Murray Ave. in the heart of Greenfield is a little dive bar named the Coop. It has 1 pool table, 1 dart board, 2 touch & plays, 2 TV's (the big screen is HD and almost always has sports on), there is a limited juke box but it has something for everybody. It can get pretty loud during a Steelers or Pens game. The owners & evening bartender are friendly and inviting.\n\nThe food is classic pub grub lovingly prepared. Wednesday is wing night and it can get pretty crazy (if you want your wings at 8p when it starts you better have your order in by 6p). All of the portions are incredibly large so come hungry. It has a better selection of beer than your average dive bar - all the big 3 beers are there plus Guinness and Heiniken.\n\nIt reminds me of Cheers - you go there a couple times and everyone knows your name and welcomes you when you walk in the door"
"Huge portions, great food & its 24 hours!!! I wish there was one these in Los Angeles. Only downside is that its always busy here. Waiting list is long. So make sure you have patience. It will pay off once you have your food. Best believe that."
"Every time I shop here for pool repair parts, I get the wrong part. The chemicals (chlorine, muriatic acid, etc.) are not good quality and the place is operated by amatuers/kids."
"My husband and I ended up at Table 10 by chance while wondering around the Palazzo trying to find a place for dinner.  The good news is that most people eat dinner super late on the strip, so we had no trouble getting a table at a normal dinner hour (around 6:00 P.M.).\n\nService was a bit slow at first but then got better.  They were not busy, so I'm not sure what the problem was.  I'd say we waited a good ten minutes to order drinks.  After that there was a dramatic improvement.\n\nI have mixed reviews to offer on the food.  I expected a better cocktail sauce to be served with the oysters.  In fact, we had much better oysters at a more reasonable price the next day at the Palace (right off the strip).  My husband's salmon was out of this world excellent--the best I've ever tasted.  On the other hand, my gumbo was nothing special.  That disappointed me, because of Emeri'ls BAM thing.  My gumbo definitely lacked the BAM factor.  Thankfully, I was saved by dessert.  We ordered and scarfed down the White Chocolate Malassadas, which are little donuts with white chocolate on the inside and cinnamon sprinkled on the outside.  Oh . . . my . . .God!!!!  Yes, they were THAT good."
"I had a fairly decently clean car to begin with,   I brought my car for a few touch ups, my trunk the back shield,  and the grill for bugs, and dash/cup holder area.\n\nMy car was parked for 10 min before I asked when they would notify me it's was complete.  They had a system error, and refused to honor my groupon. I was advised to contact corporate.  After 20 min on hold the girl who answered indicated someone would call me back.  \n\nI asked about my car,  the agent went outside and then came back and indicated it was done. \n\nThe bugs were still all over the grill,  cup holders and dash hadn't been touched,  car was clearly not vacuumed,  neither was the trunk. The service agent immediately went to wiping off the bugs, as I became more and more upset about the poorly rendered car wash.  I went inside and asked for a refund.  A gentleman told me I was just upset because of the groupon. I continued to advise it was the half hearted car wash that had me upset.  To which he continued to rebuttal that I was just upset about the Groupon. \n\nAnother associate took me to the car to find our what was wrong.  I pointed out the various items and he indicated he would fix the situation.  I ended up waiting near the detailing crew, who didn't hide the use of profanity. They we're shouting insults to one another. Not the most professional display,  even for a car wash. \n\nEventually I got my car,  still not vacuumed thoroughly and left.  Safe to say after coming sporadically (as needed) fire 7 years,  I'm fine not coming back to Dannys with the hit and miss service and bad car washes"
"Probably the BEST hotel in Montreal! As a former employee of Starwood Hotels (Particularly, Sheraton and Westin), this hotel is a model of how the Westin experience should be. The property has obviously been well invested in. It is located in a great place in Montreal, right around the corner from old Montreal. Our room had a lovely view of the park and let's you relax as soon as you walk in. Calming music is already playing as you walk in and we ended up watching a beautiful sunset from the room!\n\nWhen I needed something from our car (which was valeted), the entire staff (from Service Express to the Bell Staff) followed through, going beyond expectations. They brought the car up, but instead of having us come down and dig through things, they had us describe it on the phone and had a bellman bring the item up to our room.\n\nThat evening, we made a reservation with only a few hours notice on OpenTable to celebrate my Birthday. Upon my arrival, they were expecting us and knew our reservation without me even having to provide our name. We got to choose which table we wanted in the restaurant, but they had especially set aside a table, front and center of a corner window allowing us to truly enjoy the celebration. My mojito was delicious (and got me hooked!) and they even brought me a complimentary dessert!\n\nAlong the way, every single member of the staff was friendly and willing to go above and beyond to make sure we were happy in every aspect of our stay! The only issue I had was earning StarPoints on my eligible incidentals due to the rate I had booked on. But, the issue was eventually resolved with SPG, which is where most of the problem had stemmed from. I look forward to staying with Le Westin Montreal next time I need a hotel in Montreal!"
"This is one of the worst dim-sum spots I've ever been too. I remember coming here over a decade ago and it ruined our stay weekend in Vegas cause my whole family and I were bathroom-ridden for the rest of the day, bound by the aches of our tummies denying to effectively digest the stuff.\n\nA decade later, I opted to give it one more chance. After all, if they're around after all this time and still standing, why not? Plus, my niece  couldn't get through a casino (I like Ping-Pang-Pong's dimsum), and my brother wanted dimsum soooo Round 2. We made it happen.\n \nThis place did NOT make it happen. Shoulda took the hint when the only people who were chinese were the staff. Everything was too salty, tasted too old, or wasn't steaming. \n\nI don't want to get into it... Cause it gets gross from here, but I'll say that those 2-stars go out to the convenience and speed of the place... Because it's pretty empty."
"I like this place a lot, however I think it needs a little work.  I love that they have better quality items and more avalibility than Buffalo Exchange, but the artsy design on the inside is cool but kinda half assed.  Overall I really like the concept and am a huge advocate of small business, so I would reccommend it to a friend."
"been here twice. im a mild sandwich buff. \n\nmy sis and i was craving something wholesome for lunch, so we came in and i wanted a hot sub,  so i asked what was good. guy at the reg' gave me three options: meatball, steak, or chicken. meatball fo'sh. since this place is italian, why not. it comes with mozzerela but i love provolone, so i switched. my sis got the steak pizza sandwich, and we shared a basket of steak fries. he had a regular fountain drink, but the \""manhattan\"" espresso coffee soda spoke to me.\n\nwhen my total reached to $27.60 for our whole order, my first reaction, was \""my bf is gonna kill me for spending this much. hope it's worth it.\""\n\nsports were on so i was watching that while thinking if i was charged right. it seemed right. in that moment, i wanted to drop a star.\n\nthis shop is no ordinary sub shop. owner shirley took care of us like she was  \""aunt shirley\"" and we were coming over her house to enjoy her best recipe's. when i mean she took care of us, she basically waited on us, the way our mama's take care of us when we're sick. \n\nwe got our food, let me tell you, i was kinda discouraged at how small it looked. but then i took a bite into the meatball, wow, \""that's one good meatball\"".  that one meatball was packed with flavor, like mary poppins' suitcase is full of magic. ive had other meatball sandwiches, that weren't so great because it would fall apart, but they use the wholesome bread durable to hold all the sauce and meatballs, and cheese. the owners followed up on how we enjoyed our food, they ask with so much pride in their recipes. i can't argue. in the end the price is reasonable because the sub is suffice for folks with great appetites. i'm able to take home the other half for later.\n\n5 full stars for the hospitality and quality\n\nthey also have a mini fridge of italian desserts, such as cannoli's. gotta try that next time."
"This place is very modern, clean and artsy. It had a bit of asian zen to it... Or tried to but its nice. \n\nService\nThis guy named James totally helped me out. He was so nice. I was locked out of my room twice (the key card system is kinda jacked up) and he was so patient with me and gave me extra keycards to try just in case. I was so frustrated with their key system. He was great tho.\n\nRoom\nStandard room\nPretty and so techy!\nThere is a switch for everything! If we were going to bed, we just hit the Goodnight button and everything shuts off and the curtains closes. Pretty awesome.\n\nBed has tons of pillows. A lot! \n\nRoom was spacious! Bathroom had separate toilet and shower space. Bathtub and shower in same place.\n\nCondiments at Aria suck. Haha. Shampoo had no scent and felt like cheap hotel shampoo. Not something you would expect from a high end place like Aria. So I was surprised. Yes I take that into consideration! Im asian!\n\nOverall, good hotel!"
"don't often love corporate chains..but love the Yard House..great selections of drinks and food..love the variety...everyone is always pleased with their meal..from fresh salads to tacos..  :)  service is always friendly and accommodating......had the wings..tasty but small, ahi tuna salad and clam chowder.  The pork belly tacos and carnitas are also a crowd pleaser...keep up the good work!!"
"I was impressed with David's Hamburgers and Mexican food. The building is a cozy little 50's themed outlet in Scottsdale. The music matched the decor and was enjoyable. The place was clean, not spotless, but clean. \n\nI ordered the guacamole burger. It came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. You can also get fries, onion rings, or cole slaw included in the cost of the burger. I got fries. I also got a Dr. Pepper. The fries were good, but nothing noteable. The burger was also good. Perfectly cooked to what I ordered. The guacamole was amazing and everything else was good.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was the service here. My server was a slender middle aged man with grey/white hair and glasses. I sadly did not catch his name. He gave me PHENOMENAL service. I was greeted promptly, he was knowledgeable about the menu, he checked back on me often, but not too often. My beverage was NEVER empty and he was professional in his conduct. He even gave me a to-go cup so I could have Dr. Pepper when I left. I sincerely hope that all of their staff are this way and that he is recognized for his AMAZING service. I will return to David's on this aspect alone.\n\nTo conclude, the food was good, the building was pleasant, and the service was PERFECT. I recommend you try David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food."
The servers were extremely rude and rushy. \nThe man wouldnt allow us to get our table until everyone arrived. Even though 5/7 people were already there. We didnt get our drinks until 25 mins after we were seated. Food wasnt that flavorful. The servers don't make eyecontact with you and The tables are extremely close to each other.
"2 words: Awe. Some. \n\nGreat fish & Chips, great Po' Boys, so far have loved everything I have tried."
YUMMY!!!! Can't go wrong with Panera. The thing that urks me most is the single door entrance/exit...this place needs double doors with all the people going through it!
"Perhaps I expect too much out of a diner. \n\nThey put us in a room that was about 90 degrees. The waitress seemed more fit to be a bartender at the Rouge West than a waitress at a Diner. \n\nThe food was ok, kind of bland and tasteless. I much prefer My Mothers Restaurant for this type of food. \n\nOn the plus side a dude in a bear suit scared the living hell out of a small child, so the trip wasn't a total loss."
"This was my first time at Wendy's, my best friend had been going here forever so I assumed it wouldn't be too bad. \n\nTo start we were instantly greeted and the place looked clean. Unfortunately there was mostly dark colors of polish to choose from which was a huge bummer. My friend got her nails started and I sat next to her waiting for someone to become available to do mine, mind you I was the only one waiting. A few minutes later two ladies walked in and were taken care of before myself when the other technicians were finished, I let it slide. After 20 minutes went by, Wendy (the owner) arrived and started my full set. She was rough and rushed the whole time. Meanwhile another customer came in, she waited, but was obviously impatient. She offered to come back, but Wendy rushed through my nails, which are uneven and have gunk underneath them. She told me to wait aside as she give this lady a fill and polish change. So I waited for her to complete the other lady while I waited to get my polish. She rushed painting the polish, as well as making a mess around my fingers. I'm only content with my nails, and I will not be going back."
"Just stopped in for a beer....  Totally forgot about Happy Hour!! So I enjoyed $1 off my Epicenter Amber.  I also opted for one of the $6 App HH specials.  I went with the SanTan Slingers....or something.... Not bad....weren't great but they were good.  Thanks SanTan for being generous with the dipping dressing!! Nothing worse than running out of sauce! :)  The server was friendly and attentive...considering I was only one of two tables on the patio.  Great atmosphere, beer and food.  Looking forward to going back.  Thanks SanTan!!"
well it was the best we found in charlotte in the first 4 hours. we met the hot guy at the bar and his hot d.j. fella. they didn't go home wth us. which pissed us off. \n\nso far charlette is making me angry and bored.
First time delta out of PHX and wasn't to bad. F class as usual is overrated domestically and overpriced. \n\nService from FA's was pretty decent and the newer planes are nice with great PE systems.\n\n\nOut of all domestic travel this definitely ranked pretty high (although that's not saying much).
"Used to have to come here to pick up coffee for my lazy boss but after switching jobs realized I was right next door and have now been coming every day for nearly a year. \n\nWard and Monica are great. They will let you try stuff, explain coffee stuff, and recommend stuff. \n\nEveryone loves the kale but the stalker and squashed mango are my favorites."
"One very late dinner ago, we stumbled upon this locale.  \nMy anxiety of not having a proper dine that night, soon enough fluttered away.  \nThe menu while not an extensive one, touched upon a good range of dishes.\nWe wined and dined on steak & lobsters that night, with a birds eye view of the castle's luminance.  There were just two other tables that Friday night for dinner at 11.  Perfectly intimate. \n\nThat was our first night out in Edinburgh, a day after moving here.  I remembered my lobster was just right, the steak was beautifully under, the wine mingled with every sensory jive.  But not the name.  \n\nA night out for drinks and a spontaneous call for dinner this past Saturday, had us landing at a place called The Outsider.  Good ratings, food pics-check, okay we'll give it a go.  Soon as we arrived at the entrance, I was ecstatic when I realised where we were.  Dinner at 9:30 meant the place was bustling and we had to wait a good deal for our food to arrive.  But service was efficient and friendly.  Baked sea bream spiced with greens & truffle oil was delicate yet distinctly robust in flavour.  The ribeye was just gone too fast, the wine was good enough for another round, and still the same beautiful view remained.  2/2 was a hit.  I would happily return for a lovely dinner in candlelit ambiance.\n\nGiven the view, quality of food, wine list, service, I give it a solid 4 stars."
"I LOVE chipotle but when comparing this locations to others, I get about half as my food in my burrito bowl. Seriously, at home I get enough for an entire second meal after I'm full. It would be great if the employees would just add a little more to the burrito bowls."
"Nope. This is overpriced nonsense. I hate to start out the review with a statement so crass, but truly, its location allows this establishment to charge a great deal of money for a meal that is not really that good. Once you get past the pot of liquid and the skewer, think about what you're eating, and then look at the bill. These things do NOT add up."
"I went here a few years ago. The staff was so rude to me and stand-offish to both my friend and I that I refuse to go back. I've heard that because of the bad economy they have since had to lay off the entire staff. Maybe now that they're desperate, they'll be nicer to potential customers. Either way, I still won't go back."
"Great German food in an exact replica of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany."
"Located in Planet Hollywood..a bit of a mission to find if you parked in their parking garage. \nA huge line of people waiting to get their sammich on. \n\nTheir limited time only special caught my eye and looked..BOMB!\n\nIt was Chipotle chicken with bacon and avocado. DROOOL. \n\nThey have two cashiers. One to take your order, and to hand you a buzzer, and as you keep going through the line, they have drinks, chips, parfaits, fruits, and desserts to your left to get if you want it. Then they have the main cashier for you to pay. \n\nA good amount of space, seats are kind of close together, but I mean, hey whatever haha. \n\nI got me the sandwich and salt & vinegar chips. Total was about $7 and some change. Pretty good! \n\nSat my ass down, and within 3 minutes, my buzzer was a buzzin' and I went to pick up my sammy. \n\nIt doesn't look big..but it fills you up well! It was soooo delicious. Toasty warm, and so flavorful. \n\nI hear they're making one in DT Disney!? :O :O :O"
"I loved it! What a place! This is the first Chinese restaurant I've ordered from in Tempe that actually has respectable food. This will always be my first choice for delivery. The vegetables taste fresh and delicious, the chicken has just the right amount of sauce, and the rice portions are perfect as always."
"This is a difficult review to write.  I had the $39.99 prix fixe tasting menu about which the Mirage has been sending me emails for a few months.  \n\nAll the food I had was excellent.  I had lobster tacos, the prime skirt steak, and the jelly donut munchkin holes for dessert.  These get high marks in my review.  The tacos were luscious--the guacamole served with them was excellent!  The skirt steak was served with two sauces that were also very well done.  The munchkin jelly donut holes were really tasty with or without the vanilla sauce that came with them.\n\nNow for the minuses.  I had no bread service.  Evidently, if you order from the prix fixe menu, there is no bread service.  I didn't notice this until I was almost finished with my steak, so I didn't bother to ask then.  The steak came with two thin waffle potato chips.  That's it--no side of any kind, not a carrot slice, one broccoli floret, nothing!  I found it amazing when the server suggested I might want to order a side so I had enough to eat.  I did order a side of mashed potatoes at $8.  That sort of negates the prix fixe of early dining.\n\nWhen I first arrived the waitress brought me a \""new\"" prix fixe menu at $59.99 that I should consider as it would entail more food.  This is not on the Mirage website.  I did notice there was more food served including sides.  It seems to be a bait and switch scheme, but maybe no.\n\nI considered giving Stack a 2 rating but the food was all so good, I just couldn't.  I do know I won't be returning here.\n\nEdit:  You know, I have to give it a 2 star rating.  This just doesn't deserve 3 stars.  One star deleted."
"I enjoy the rotating artwork from local artists, beer selection (and beer specials!), and they host a figure drawing class on Mondays.  Certainly one of my favorite bars in Plaza."
"In my area, I have my choice of Time Warner, Windstream & DirectTV. I went with Time Warner many years ago because of the fabulous bundle pricing (basic cable DVR & high speed internet, only). Unfortunately, like almost everything else, they reward you so well as a new customer, but do not offer anything for loyalty.\n\nI've been with them almost 6 years & the first few years were fine.  I was happy with a below $100 bill every month & never had any outages.  Fast forward to the past couple of years & I've had outages out of the blue, significant rate increases, locked into two different year contracts, only to have my bill stand at a whopping $141 every month.  When calling to report outages / issues, I get the run around & a \""few days out\"" scheduled appointment.  As far as trying to get a better deal on my service...I'm always told, \""there aren't any promotions available to you right now\"".\n\nBuyer's remorse? You bet."
"This was my first buffet I've been since being away from Vegas for years. And this wasn't my best decision. \n\nMy boys and I were wanted to grab a meal at a buffet before our night out in the city of sin.  Apparently, this was the closest one and had a short line. Once we got to cashier, I was in shock to hear how much an individual had to pay for buffet dinner. For the price for an individual had to pay, we could've got the 24 hour buffet pass. More buffets to visit at different hotels.\n\nOnce we paid, we waited a couple minutes for our table.  After our table was ready and then seated, our server took our drink orders. When everything was settled at the table, we were off to explore the buffet's offerings.\n\nThe selections were very limited since some stations were left unreplenished. With what was available, I had to make my $47 dinner worth it. I went for the grilled meats: kobe beef & prime rib, short rib tacos, assortments of sushi & sashimi, and beef Wellington. For dessert, I got mini churros and vending machine ice cream.\n\nThe pros:\n- Short rib tacos\n- Shasimi & sushi\n\nThe cons:\n- Grilled meats were very dry, also the beef Wellington\n- Mini churros were hard and stale\n- Ice cream from the vending machine taste like any other buffet place back home\n\nOur server was helpful but got all our drink orders wrong. I left full, dissaponinted, and unsatisfied."
Very nice pub me and my gf go there at least twice a month for the food. The food is really  really good!! Service is excellent and the atmosphere you can't beat it. Mainly locals of the war streets but not always. We have met some really nice people and the servers are always so nice to us. Of all the places on the north shore to grab a meal I would recommend this one. Prices are good and you can't beat the service.
"We came in here on a Sunday night and had the worst experience EVER. I love cheesecake factory but the service was horrible. We waited for 45 mins for our table, got seated & waited another 20 mins to get greeted. Our food came out cold and the server never came back once to check up on us once he delivered our food. We complained to the manager and he was nice enough to comped our dinner and apologized to us."
"They have the fitbit aria scale here!   So it's $129.99.  The fitbit flex in slate or violet is $99.99.  Yeesh!\nI don't shop here routinely but this is one of the stores I come to purchase cd's when they're on sale.  For whatever reason they have a much better selection than Mall Wart and they usually have a new release, that I might like, at a low price every couple of months.\nWhat I don't like about Target is their cheezy baskets of seasonal items on display near the entrance.  Lots of poor quality, Made in China items, sold for next to nothing.  I see most of this stuff as waste that frequently winds up at Goodwill and/or landfills.\nThe store is generally clean and shelves stocked.  The staff is pleasant enough.\nNot sure how much profit they've generated now that all employees walk around attached to walkie talkies (you remember those right?  I mean you're old enough to remember those, right?), but wish they could turn the volume down on the things and possibly refrain from following me while talking on them.  I always turn around to see if they're talking to me because like I said, I don't shop here regularly."
"For $18, I felt like I got maybe an $10 experience.  The entire reef is much smaller than I thought.  You start off in a jungle like atmosphere (hot and humid).  As you wind down a stone pathway, you will see signs from the Monterrey Bay Aquarium about conservation and such.  I saw it more like propaganda.  One curator was standing by the piranhas.  She wouldn't talk to anyone unless if you asked her questions.  She was very matter of fact and short with all the visitors.  Nothing really stood out.  They have two tunnels to walk through where you can see the sharks which is pretty cool.  The stingray pool and jellyfish tank were OK I suppose.  If you're a fish fanatic like I am, you will be greatly disappointed.  On the other hand for parents, this is a great way to entertain the kids in Vegas.  I'm glad I didn't drag any of my other friends with me."
"Pretty average establishment and one of the few places undeserving of its 4/5 Yelp rating in my opinion.\n\nThe place is average in terms of size and accomodations.  It has a frustratingly small parking lot.  The service is slow and the staff is generally pretty obnoxious.  The food ranges from typical bar fare to a  couple upscale dishes.\n\nThe deal breaker here is the atmosphere.  I see reviews stating that it's a \""great laid-back place to go hang out\"".  I'm not sure what bar they were talking about, but it isn't Casey Moore's.  This is the type of place people go to be seen.  Most of the patrons on the weekends look like they fell out of an Urban Outfitters ad.  These are the type of people that spend three hours in front of the mirror perfecting their \""just threw this outfit on\"" look.  Yes indie kids, I'm talking to you: Don't worry, they serve PBR here.  I know you'll lose your superhero powers of \""listening to music no one's ever heard of\"" if you don't consume at least one Pabst a day. \n\nIf you're determined to go, go on a weekday and avoid the hipsters.   People send friends ahead to camp out tables for entire weekend evenings, so good luck finding a place to sit.  Otherwise, just head a few blocks away to Four Peaks."
"I went to Del Frisco's last night because I had never been to one.  I was starving after a long flight.  I sat at the bar and had a lemon drop where the simple syrup used was way too sweet.  The Caesar salad was good (but did have a leaf with the red stuff in it) and the steak tips, because I was traveling and couldn't eat a whole steak.  I thought this would be a good way to taste the \""exceptional\"" food this restaurant had to offer.  I was wrong.  I know it was a low end dish, but each steak tip almost broke my teeth because they were only grissel (sp?).  In fact, there was bone in one of them.  I wasn't asked how my meal was until after I was done.  For my second drink I asked for less lemon and that didn't  happen.  The reason I'm giving two stars is that it was fun to watch the bartender at work.  There are so many other choices in Vegas--when I come back I will go somewhere else."
"We were pleasantly surprised at how good our meal here was!  Great Server, too...very attentive and even brought us a free dessert Fried Ice Cream because it was our first time there!  Now that's how you should treat customers!  We loved the chips and the bean dip.  Their kids menu is awesome and had something to please each of my 3 picky eaters.  I had the pollo fundido  which was delicious and my husband had the fajita style chicken chimichanga and he loved it!  We will definitely be back!  The only reason I didn't give them all 5 stars was due to our table being old looking and very unstable (wobbly).  This is really a minor thing, but nice furniture always adds to the ambience of a restaraunt.  The most important things, the food and service, get very high marks from me!"
"This is the WORST airline ever. I will gladly be herded onto Southwest like some fat ass cattle rather than ever endure the torture of US Airways again.\n\nHow can any businesses possibly be such a mess? Ever since they were merged with craptastic America West it's been downhill. Every person from the counter bitches to the flight attendants were out of control rude. It's clear this airline does not value their customers.  The flight attendants were so rude on my last flight that it shocked me. \n\nAnd now you want to charge me $30 for an aisle seat. Fuck you!\n\nAnd don't tell me it's just the industry that's taking a dive because riding on Jet Blue is like going to freaking Disneyland! Polite customer service people, happy flight attendants, snacks, tv's, on time arrivals.... dignity."
"My buddies and I decided to eat here while all of us suffered from hangovers.  The delicious food here will restore your apetite from whatever came back out from the previous night.  The family style is a great way to enjoy the meal.  They provide a lot of food for their prices.\n\nWe started with the potato soup which relly jump started my apetite.  It's rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Next up was the Beef Braciole.  This dish was quite interesting.  The texture was weird yet it was edible (may have been my hangover dulling my senses).  I can't quite remember the name of the next dish, but it was a spicy spaghetti and meat balls, I believe.  The spiciness brought back all my senses and pretty much kicked me out of my intoxicated state.  You can never go wrong with spaghetti and meatballs.  We also had the Rigatoni \""D\"".  The chicken was tender and the protein gave me energy for more partying.  \n\nThey gave us enough food to take back to the hotel and have for dinner.  If you love Italian food and pastas, this place would be a place to stop by."
"This was my first fine dining experience, and it lived up to my expectations. The d\u00e9cor is luxurious; the waiters were helpful and pleasant; and every morsel of food was packed with complex flavors. \n\nAs many reviewers have pointed out, don't be shy with the bread cart. You're paying good money for this meal, so go for it! I chose five breads, and each one was memorable. My favorite was the gruyere brioche, because it was delicate and flaky but had a pronounced cheese flavor.\n\nAs for the amuse bouche, it is crab mixture topped with caviar. This was my first bit of caviar, and I wasn't too thrilled with it, but I can't blame Joel for that because it's a matter of taste. If you know that you don't like caviar, I recommend that you ask for an alternate amuse bouche. My boyfriend is allergic to seafood, so he asked for an alternate when we were ordering. The waiter was very understanding and produced a cold beat soup. I know beet soup doesn't sound appetizing, but it was delicious. \n\nI order le sole for my main dish, and I was very pleased. The sauce was silky and savory. My boyfriend order some sort of red meat dish. He didn't seem to be crazy about the meat, but he really liked the accompanying vegetables, which says a lot because he doesn't eat a lot of vegetables.  \n\nMy desert, le chocolat, was divine. I adore ice cream, and the coffee ice cream was the best that I've ever eaten. The dish also had melted chocolate and fresh whipped cream, which made every bite different. \n\nJust like the bread cart, don't be shy with the desert cart. I chose five different desert morsels. I recommend the five spice chocolate and the strawberry cheesecake with liquor. The five spice chocolate tasted like the love child of a pumpkin pie and a chocolate truffle. The cheesecake was a wonderful surprise, because it appears to be a firm ball when you hold it, but it almost explodes in your mouth. You could say it was a flavor explosion. \n\nThis review was much longer than I intended, but I couldn't stop typing. That's how much I loved Joel."
"C'mon man! Really! Your killing me! \nHouston's is such a great food and service oriented establishment that I was excited to take my wife there for her birthday. We were seated right away and the waiter was quick to ask for the drink order. We ordered wine by the glass. I like the service as far as they give, they change out your settings and take away the dishes in an anonymous way. We started with the artichoke, which was a special that night. Really good of course like Bandaras. The sauce was different, but we really enjoyed it. \n\nThe Mrs ordered the Hawaiian ribeye with a weird lemon flavored caesar salad. I had the special NY strip steak Medium rare. We got our wine OK and they stopped by a few times to check on us. We got our entrees and everything looked great. The steaks were good size. The Hawaiian Ribeye was thinner than most ribeye cuts and had a Hawaiian sauce. Mehhhh very so so! The Strip came full of taste but a little tough. It came with fries which were awesome! I wish I had some bread or somethin... After the food came, it was like we were on an island. No one came until we were almost done. The Mrs. needed a refill and they took the glass away, but never asked if we would like another round. Bummer... C.mon - I drop over a Cnote and I cannot get another wine! Someone?... It was like they were just tryin to get us outta there. Boooo!\n\nThe vibe was awesome! The interior is great! Next time, I want to go sit at the bar with all the cougars and people wandering in from the patio looking for the front desk - that makes for good people watching. \n\nWe skipped desert there and went to Culvers for frozen custard!"
My husband and I loved this place. The staff was very helpful with ordering and allowed us to sample six of their most popular items. We had enough food for leftovers the next day for under $25. It was great to see everything from ties to tatoos having a good time. My only complaint is that the restaurant could be a little cleaner.
Seriously good pizza.
"An update -- I have always been a big supporter and a fan of Pacific Seafood Buffet.  But me thinks not anymore.  Went there for dinner last night, which was Tuesday night.  The menu was basically the same and most things were still pretty consistent and good.  But they had a few items that were not-so-good.  Their Korean kalbi short ribs were very tough and overcooked.  Their fish dishes were using poorer quality fish so they were not as tasty, their mapo tofu is getting less and less tasty.  But the kicker that pushed me over the edge to now say that I am no longer a fan is that they have been advertising on their home mailer flyers coupons for $1.00 off for lunch and $2.00 off for dinner.  These flyers have \""cut out\"" coupons on them that automatically tells you that you need to bring the coupons with you.  But on the top of the flyer is says seniors (60+) get 20% off all the time.  When we had dinner last night, they would not give me and my wife our senior citizen's prices since we did not bring the flyer with us.  I explained that the flyer says nothing about bringing the flyer and in fact, it says 20% off for seniors everyday now.  Still they would not give me our discounts.\n\nSo I paid full price.  I know someone who works at PSB and asked them about this and I was told (I know this is a rumor) that this has been discussed with the management and owners, along with the fact that the website pricing is wrong too, and the staff have been told that these \""strategies\"" help the establishment bring in more customers and get more revenue from customers.  WTH???  So is there is a conscious effort in-place to falsely advertise prices and mislead potential customers?  Assuming that what I was told is true, this seems like economic suicide to me and is also illegal.\n\nSo Yelpers, just beware and cautious.  The food is still OK, but deteriorating slightly, but this new information is very troubling to me."
"I put in an order for pick up. My food was ready on time and my order was correct even with my modifications. This is not a 5 star restaurant, but it was 5 stars for what it is!"
"Best pool party in Vegas hands down. Back in the day Rehab was the spot now this is the go to. Great crowd, great Dj's."
"We came here to watch the playoffs. I made a reservation since I knew it was going to be busy. I knew everyone will be looking for a table to watch the games. The host told me not to worry and that my table will be ready. When I got there, I didn't get my table and we had to wait for the upstairs to open. This bar was not ready to host any big games. The bartender that served my margarita didn't make it right. So easy to mess up a margarita..  Food was ok. Regular bar food. They were not very accommodating especially when you have reservations. The hostess just sat everyone that walked in. She had no clue about playoffs Sunday. I should've just watched the games at the sports book in a casino. Atleast they give out free drinks!"
"I am an art lover but don't dig the overkill by the people who are \""guarding\"" the art from the common folk.  After having a run-in with an over-zealous guard and then discussing it with Heather the manager, I will most likely not return.  They are many friendlier art installations in the valley...I will give them my hard-earned support instead."
I don't know why yinz are complaining. Every time I deal with the Parking Authority I get a free colonoscopy.
"Yikes! Tasty Joe's was not very tasty.\n\n I tried this place for the first time and was not impressed.\n I either went on an a very off day or my taste buds exceed that of the approving reviewers.\n\nThe potstickers were severely FRIED and without any flavor. The dipping sauce was flavorless. Are potstickers not usually boiled, steamed or light pan fried?\n\nThere was an odd burnt or chemical taste/smell associated with the Thai noodle bowl. (almost like the cooktop had a considerable build up of bad oil and other things?  I ate perhaps (3) three bites from the pad thai noodle bowl. I could not choke down anymore. \n\nI did something I have not done in years, I left the food on the table.  Feeling guilt over the ensuing wastefulness and anger at having wasted the money.\n\nMy friends singapore noodles was one of the most vile tasting concoctions I have tried.\n\nThe woman behind the counter was very nice and accomodating however."
"Growing up in Madison, I have heard about this place for years.  It is with that and Restaurant Week that my girlfriend and I ventured out there last night.\n\nThe environment was great, nice and cozy with a higher class feel. Great lighting and seating arrangement.\n\nThe service was good, nothing bad, but nothing spectacular.\n\nHowever, the point of this was for the food. Sadly, that did not live up to the hype, not even marginally.\n\nThe bread and oil served as a precursor was incredible. The oil was infused with a nice spice that went great with the warm sourdough.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the Italian Stuffed Mushrooms and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip.  The dip was incredible, hot, gooey, with a crusty yet easily broken up bread. The mushrooms left much more to be desired.  Initially, they tasted like a pizza without a crust, but as I chewed, the pepper became overwhelming.  That was the first one.  After that, I could scarcely taste anything but pepper.\n\nOur entrees were a stuffed steak, what I would refer to as a Steak Parmigiana and Stuffed Shrimp with Spinach Fettuccine. The marinara with the steak was ok, most likely homemade, but the steak was overcooked to the point of being tough. And overall the dish was rather bland, even with the sauce and cheese.  The shrimp dish was no better.  The shrimp itself was good, but the stuffing and the white sauce both had little to no flavor. What little flavor that they did have was from the pasta and the shrimp.  The pasta itself was very good, as long as it was sauce free.  It had a great texture, was cooked perfectly, and made me think it was made in-house.  I did not eat most of this dish, which is nearly unheard for me.\n\nThen we had our desserts, a hazelnut gelato with a cream center and a chocolate cannoli.  Both were good, but nothing to rave about.  The cannoli's filling was very rich and it almost made itself less appealing the more I ate.  I'm a chocolate fiend and have had varieties from many countries, so this was new to me.  The cream center of the gelato was a great addition, but was offset a bit by the overabundance of cocoa on the outside.  Again, neither was bad, but they fell short of memorable.\n\nThis meal was mostly bland really.  Short of a couple highlights, it was simply a below average meal.  The one thing that I'd never think of Italian cuisine is bland. Even if you're not a fan of the flavors, they are always there and always intense.  That's part of the draw.  For Porta Bella, it's character-lacking food has persuaded me to look elsewhere."
"Long wait but once you get in it is an experience, the food is great and the beer is as authentic as you can get out of the alps"
"Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus."
"Terrible, and not cheap. The roast beef was bloody. The chicken salad was bland. The soda was watery. The only ray of light to our meal was the onion rings are super yummy. Would not suggest this place to anyone. With a million restaurants in Vegas you can find better anywhere else."
"Too bad we weren't 21, because you need alcohol to make this place okay. The appetizer did not have a volcano as described and the meat in it was dry. The crab cake seemed old and left an oily taste in our mouths. If we ever do come back here when we are in Vegas, it will be strictly to try their drinks."
Outfit to rock on the strip. This H&M was pretty much one of my favorite stores. Layout was great and their selection was very trendy.
"I Love Oregano's, but this specific location is terrible.  The food is not prepared as well as the other locations.  Very Very dissapointed"
"Ok this is a confusing review for me to write. I LOVE the cajun chicken tenders at the Wing King. LOVE THEM, no really I LOVE THEM. I also really enjoy the Ming Wings, very unusual and I'm pretty sure you can't get them anywhere else.\n\nBUT...in the 20 or so times I've been there I can honestly say I've ALWAYS experienced terrible service. Sometimes worse than others, but this is why I now consider Wing King a take-out ONLY place. Waitresses are distance and frequently down-right rude. They are neglectful and act pissy if you ask them for anything. Wing King would probably be way more successful with an entirely new wait staff."
"I ordered for delivery, they did not include cheese on my sandwich, the pizza was stone cold, but the worst part was how rude the worker was when I called.  I will never do business with them again even if they gave me everything for free, HORRIBLE"
Save your $300 initial consultation and go to a Macy's personal shopper--they are free.
"It was okay, but \""Meh, I've experienced better.\"" We were a party of 6 on a Thursday night. They made it clear that they close by 9:30pm and that they were ready for us to go. However,the server was pretty friendly and fast.\n\nThe food was just okay. The rolls were very average at best, not tightly rolled. The Catepillar roll had a very sweet eel sauce (more like a maple flavored sauce) and it was hard to eat. We had to remind them that our order was not all complete...perhaps in the rush to get our food out so we could leave by the time they closed, they may have overlooked or order. \n\nI'm confused about how this place got such high reviews, since they didn't even come close in my experience."
"A good place to grab a quick bite or snack and coffee at Caezar's Palace.\n\nI had a delicious (and large) chocolate chip cookie with a 16 oz. mocha iced drink.  Both were sweet and good. Seating was in the main Food Court area, but plenty of spaces to just relax after walking around the Strip. Good spot to sit by the bar seats so you can people watch while you chill here. \n\nFriendly service."
"I thought that I had found the deal that I was hoping to find when I found out that I needed to repair all four of my motor mounts.  I was quoted about $1,200 from dealerships and local auto repair places.  I called to get a quote to be placed on hold for 10 minutes because no one there spoke English.  Finally got somebody on the phone and said that it'd be $650.  I immediately dropped my car off next morning and never got a phone call until the next morning because again no one there spoke English.  When I went to get my PT Cruiser they had \""fix\"" all four of my motor mounts, but refused to show me the old ones they claimed to replace.  Finally one of their associates who was able to speak English told me that they had to test drive my vehicle to make sure the mounts were fixed correctly.  85 MILE test drive?!?!?!  I drove my car away feeling like I was screwed and low-and-behold, 4 four months later here I am again with the same issues Sun Valley Auto claimed to fixed..."
"This is absolutely a 5 star restaurant.  I was incredibly pleased with the service.  I went to Vegas this past weekend and after searching and searching for a steak place, we settled on Brand for my birthday dinner.  \n\nIt did not disappoint.  \n\nThe hostess was incredibly considerate, and they sat us right away, even though we were a bit early for our 8:30 reservation.  Our table was in a great location.  We were nervous about eating at a restaurant that opened up to the casino floor, but the ding of the machines could barely be heard and my date and I could talk and relax while watching the action.  \n\nOur waiter was top notch.  He knew all of the specials, had recommendations and gave us time for a nice slow birthday dinner.  He was well worth the gigantic tip we left him. \n\nIf I could give the food 10 stars I would.  We each got drinks, that were delicious and very unique.  We also ordered the fried Calamari, which came with two delicious sauces that I couldn't get enough of.  I ordered the NY Sirloin and was not disappointed.  It was absolutely the most delicious, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat that I've ever had.  I didn't even try the sauces because my meat was so delicious.  \n\nWe ordered the three sides for 23 dollars, and they were also excellent, but HUGE.  I was so disappointed that we couldn't take them home for a snack later.  We picked the mac n' cheese, which was creamy and delicious.  We also got the lobster mashed potatoes, which were incredibly unique with delicious lobster chunks in them, and the wild mushrooms, which were buttery and very well seasoned.  \n\nIt was one of the best meals of my life, so good that it prompted me to open a yelp account and write about my fantastic birthday experience there.  \n\nYum!"
"I went to Buffet at Asia on at 3:30pm dinner realize that dinner starts at 4:00pm, I only paid for lunch, the waitresses come to my table at least 8 times to see if I was eating any crab legs, however never offered me a refill on my drink...Poor service."
"Hash House is hands down the best place for breakfast in Vegas. Their portions are too big for on the spot consumption which is an issue and almost gets them four stars from me. Not too many people know this, but Hash House also serves up great lunch. This is a must visit whether you are a resident or tourist."
"I've been coming here for years with good to great service and great food. Today me and some good regulars left Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop with some SALTY ASS BALLS. YES... SALTY ASS BALLS.  There was definitely some miscommunication going on and we came up with the short end of the stick. \n\n\""Don\"", our waiter takes our order. We would like the Famous Prime Rib. \""We are TOTALLY OUT of prime rib\"". That statement says that there is no more in the vicinity. Weird because how can they be totally out when it is only lunch?  We order beef ribs, the surf and turf, and steak and eggs.  Less than 5 minutes later, the salads come out and the gentleman next to me orders the thick cut prime rib from our waiter, Don.  Interesting... \n\nWe get told after inquiring that the prime rib was not ready when we ordered it a few minutes ago, but IT'S READY NOW BITCHES!!!\n\nWe felt like we got bamboozled and the management wouldn't do anything to set things right. Don looked at his times on his receipts and said that the couple ordered it a good fifteen minutes after our orders. No sir, you typed that order in much later from when you actually \""took\"" their orders.   However long it takes to bring in a salad was when you took their orders Don.  It wasn't 15 minutes. At least your late ass ticket gets to cover your ass. \n\nIn the end, the management would not make things right with their paying regulars. Management gives us a comment card. PASHAAAAAAH!!!???!!!  I'm giving a very low rate because of the management. The food is great here. It really is. The \""waitresses\"" and \""bussers\"" are great  here too. Don is new and has RUINED our eating experience at one of our favorite lunch eateries. I'm going to miss this place..."
"I know I'm supposed to like the O and that it's a tradition, but honestly, the food is not all that good.  I like the fries, they are better than average, and the portions are huge.  My cheesesteak sandwich was not even average, and the portion of meat was very skimpy."
"The only reason I called Molly Maids was because we got a coupon in the mail for them and my mother was coming to visit.  The first issue I had was that the number on the coupon didn't even work so I had to google them to get a working number.  I made an appointment for Saturday morning on a Tuesday.  Saturday rolls around, no call, no maids.  I call and get ahold of a \""Kate\"".  She proceeds to tell me that my appointment was lost or never properly recorded in their system.  When I asked her how they were going to make this right, she got attitude and raised her voice to me.  I asked for the manager and she tells me that she's the owner and she's the only one in the office on Saturdays......G-H-E-T-T-O  Don't waste your time with this terribly run \""organization\"".  (if you can even call it that).  My friend from back home told me that the main company is going out of business all over the country.  Now, I can see why."
"Sadly, my experience at Wildfish this evening was extremely disappointing, due in large part to the total ineptitude of our waiter. He was well meaning and very pleasant (apologizing each time he messed up) but his lack of training was appalling. To specify: (1) he forgot to bring the wine we ordered, (2) forgot to order one of our side dishes so that it came a full ten minutes after our meal was served, and then (3), left the dirty dishes in front of us even while pouring our coffee. The food was fine, which is the only reason this received 2 stars rather than 1.  But it could not compensate for such bad service. It certainly wasn't worth the cost of this dinner."
"After Yes Plumbing stopped by and couldn't resolve my problem, I went with Precision Plumbing. Jason was within his two hour window, and unlike Yes Plumbing, bypassed all the hoopla and told me what my problem was - an ill fitting gasket the was connected to my supply line in my laundry area that has been causing an ongoing leak.  He explained to me the reasons for the occurrence, ran to pick up a part, and replaced it. He called quick response and Robert arrived within 30 mins. After going over some paperwork he started quickly tearing down the affected areas (laundry area and secondary bedroom) to get me on my way to restoration. These two were a godsend after my experience with Yes Plumbing. Thank you again."
"I had a blast in Las Vegas this weekend but was disappointed in #MGMGrand Signature Suites. Having spent 15+ years of my life in the hospitality industry, I know how to judge exemplary customer service (or lack thereof). The front desk agents were curt and unapologetically rude. The room still had trash and glassware from the previous occupants and the requested call from the management never came. I also had to hold 30 for 30 minutes to speak with accounts payable upon my arrival home to contest their incorrect billing. I would advise my friends and family to chose a different hotel on their next visit."
"I'm not sure about why people complain about the prices\nAt HT?  Publix subs are a dollar more and not as good. If you are a VIP member you get all kinds of great weekly deals like 1.77 eggs!  This is a great little store in uptown with free garage parking (up to 90 minutes) and a giant amount of wine for the space.  The only issue I have is because of the multiple entrances, there are multiple register areas creating flow issues and confusion.  If you live West of 77 I recommend this HT over the BiLo off Freedom."
"My friend and I came here for because we needed to cure our hangovers...lol. The Pho here is pretty good, I can't complain. The eggs rolls were even better!!! if you check in, you get 2 free egg rolls!! Anyways, the bowls are pretty big. We could not finished our noodle soup. I will definitely go back to this place next time i go to Vegas thats if I remember too."
"Went here with my girlfriend after walking to the Zenith Tea Garden and realizing it was closed for a private party.\n\nThe atmosphere inside of the bar is much better than most of the places found in the Southside. When you don't belong to the popped collar crowd of bar hoppers it's often hard to find a bar you can relax inside of in that area of Pittsburgh.\n\nOTB has some great \""bar food\"" that is also healthy, most of the sandwiches and salads had the option of substituting seitan with chicken which is very appealing to vegetarians and health minded bar goers.\nI had the Rail Trail Wrap which was chicken, lettuce, carrots, and provolone cheese inside of a pita. The chicken was tossed in a perfect amount of Buffalo sauce (so many places put way too much to the point where all you can taste is the sauce) and the pita was warm, fluffy, and chewy. I ordered onion rings but the chef mistakenly made french fries. I'm a pretty \""live and let live\"" guy so I let it go but the waitress offered to make a batch for free. I declined; fries are slightly healthier than onion rings, and it wasn't a big deal. The fact that she caught the mistake and offered to correct it was all I needed to remain happy.\n\nMy girlfriend got tomato soup and a mozzarella, red pepper, and tomato panini. I am not a fan of tomato soup but I tried a spoonful and thought it was really good. It didn't taste canned and you could see small amounts of the tomato which leaves me to believe that it was homemade; needless to say, it was delicious, as was the sandwich she had.\nOTB is a great little bar that isn't just for bike enthusiasts. But at the end of a bike ride it'd be great to grab a beer there and eat a healthy lunch while watching one of their two big plasma screens.\n\nI have a review of a second experience here: http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/09/20/setting-the-bar-food-higher/"
"I would give them zero stars if it were possible. \n\nMy wife tore her ACL on a Saturday, went to the ER. Visited her PCP the following business day to get a referral.  SW Medical sent her here. They initially told her they couldn't see her until FOUR MONTHS LATER!!!! I fought through their BS after hours of hold times and finally got an appointment to see someone three weeks after the injury, only to have them cancel on her the business day before the appointment. What A-holes! They pretty much told us to go F ourselves....What is the reason you ask for cancelling? Apparently, they aren't contracted with the ER that she went to (even though our insurance is) and that is where the HMO sent us-so they refused to treat her. \n\nIn a way this review is unfair because she never actually got to see any of their doctors, but I am just giving you the facts of what happened and how terribly we were treated by the staff. I have worked for 13 years in healthcare and have never had an office treat me or any of the patients I work with so poorly.\n\nWe contacted our insurance and found another orthopedist who was happy to take our carrier and was able to get her in ASAP, so if your insurance tells you that Nevada  Othopedic and Spine Center is where you should go, tell them to give you other options to avoid a terrible experience like ours."
"The night we stayed was a wedding gift from a family member. She was charged extra for a late check out when she was not supposed to and paid extra for the romance package which they did not do. They tried to charge someone elses credit card for our room and when it declined we could not check in unless we gave a credit card. Mind you this was paid for a few days earlier with a confirmation number. When they tried the phone number to fix the problem it was wrong of course so not rectified in time. My aunt had to drive down there while we were at dinner and demand things get fixed the right way with no offer to refund any amount to make her happy. The morning we checked out early and there was still a late check out fee for her and my credit card was still billed as well as hers.  We do not recommend this place at all for all the hassle you have to go thru to stay there. Oh and our room key was incorrect so after driving around, bringing all our luggage upstairs our key did not open the door so we had to go back to the front desk for another one. It was a nice gift that would have been great if it went well. I was so sorry for my aunt how embarrassing."
"I went to Carolinas Vision Group on a refer from Minute Clinic when I scratched my eye. The staff was very courteous and got me in to see the Dr immediately. His focus opwas making me feel better, and controlling the amount of pain I was in. I have never been to such a professional and caring eye doctor. I already scheduled my annual eye exam! I would highly recommend!"
"Beep boop Vegas-bot errorrrr errorrrr, cannot compute, cannot compute.\n\nSeriously, how on earth is is possible to get top of the line sushi... in the middle of the desert. Naked Fish puts coastal sushi restaurants to shame. I don't know how they do it, but they have some how managed to provide a great sushi experience without a natural body of water in sight.\n\nWe were on the tail end of a road trip when we decided to make a Vegas detour and being the sushi-monsters that we are sushi was on the brain. Yelped and found Naked Fish.\nWent in, nice atmosphere, dark wooded and cosy. \nWe ordered the Naked Crab for appetiser, which was very nice. We then proceeded to order 2 rolls and then a third. For the first two we had the GTR, spicy tuna and shrimp tempura together is always a hit, and then the Kamikaze, which I loved as I'm an eel fan. For our third, Deja Vu, spicy salmon, with salmon on top of it, super salmon all around.\nI really don't know if sushi can get any better in Vegas. I really want to find out, but this place was great by any standard."
"Wish I'd read these reviews before I went there, but I was getting my phone fixed down the street, and decided a quick car wash would help kill the time. The previous reviewers are right on the money when it comes to the ol' up-sell. You would think with all these reviews saying the same thing it would be looked into, and trust me, I understand the value of a good up-sell...but THREE times with THREE separate people? It's a little much. Plus, if I come in there initially inquiring over the $4.99 price and asking if there is anything lower than the $32 price (which to be fair, yes, there is) what in the world makes you think I am going to want to spend upwards of 60 dollars? Honestly. And it shouldn't take me 10 minutes to convey to you that I really am not concerned with my windshield right now...that's right, I'm gonna take a gamble on that one, I live on the edge like that....\n\nYou did do a pretty good job cleaning the car, but leaving a car wash of all places feeling frazzled is not my thing. Not to mention, I fell for the $4 \""Supreme Upgrade\"" and you forgot my vanilla air freshener. Dang it. Had no idea what kind of negotiation would occur if I went back, so I will look at it as a lesson learned and go on with my life....:)"
"I took my family here on Valentine's Day. What a disaster! The 45-minute wait was to be expected given that it was Feb. 14, but the hour-long wait to get our food wasn't. Plus, the food was terrible. The clam chowder had some weird spice in it and was congealed. Ick! The burger had a soggy bottom bun. The lobster bisque was gross. It tasted like butter and cream with very little lobster. The only thing I liked was the wedge salad (but it's hard to mess up a chunk of lettuce sprinkled with bacon, blue cheese and tomatoes.) We were all disappointed and will never go back."
"Considering we could only get reviews at 11pm on Sunday evening.. Our evening was already going to be ..different.  I work for Food Network and I could not pass up a chance to eat here. Plus, Derek Bocking of Top Chef Canada fame was sitting nearby. Martin, not there at the time.. alas.\n\nThe first thing to note is that they hoarded the English speakers to the front. This is understandable, so the waitress could speak to us all, but she chose to do so.. in an interesting way. She would address us, along with the two tables on either side simultaneously. Interesting approach. The washroom is unmarked, I needed help to find, and the floor was SLICK with grease. A friend we made in line wiped out the second he walked in. Oh, also the air reaks of rendering pig fat.. but if you can make it past all of this.. there is the food. \n\nthe SO and I, having waited to 11pm to eat dinner, were famished and over ordered. The smoked sausage starter was really outstanding. I am German and well versed on smoked sausage. It was sour, and perfect. \n\nI enjoyed the French onion soup which was mostly bubbling cheese (yum) and a delicious rosemary infused broth. There were chunks fo pork in it which I found detracted from the soup. Still, really good. \n\nSpecial tuna \""handroll\"" with chopped tuna, nori, rice, fish eggs and quail egg. Ridiculous. Best handroll I have ever had. \n\nMy main was a special, a tuna with eggplant and tomato. It was really good, albiet slightly overcooked. The SO had a pot of various pig bits on mashed potato. he liked it other than the blood sausage which he found only ok (although just recently back from a Blood fueled fiesta in Germany) We were too full to finish and unable to at 1am. The two mains were amazing fresh form the hotel room fridge the next morning.\n\nWine was good, beer selection ok. We had a good meal. Kinda pricey, keep that in mind. And reservations... book early."
"Worst tapas for the price. Ever. I think we paid $8 for two of the tiniest dumplings with barely any filling. We reasoned that the olives, for $5, were the only fairly priced dish. And it's not that we're against high priced food, not at all, it's just what you're getting for that price... which is the worst pita bread that you could get at a restaurant that claims to be serving freshly prepared food (it was likely purchased from the Southside Giant Eagle).\n\nWhat hurts even more: the cocktail menu. We were shocked and offended to find a martini (a proper gin and vermouth martini) called a \""stuffed up\"" - it's bad enough the add martini to drink names that have no right being called a martini, but to call a martini anything other than a martini is outrageous. They mutilated the classics like mojitos and tom collins and made them $10. The $10 tomato juice and tomato vodka that I got was delicious, but I felt that the price gouging on both food and drinks was highly... aghhh! Just don't go.\n\nI was also kind of taken aback that the waitress asked the standard \""have you been here before\"" spiel that you'll usually get a national chain. YES we know what tapas are, stop pretending like you invented some kind of new cuisine that needs to be explained to us.\n\nNice atmosphere and nice people, but go somewhere else. Like Ibiza."
"Been coming here for the past few years always a must! Everything is always delicious, the staff is great. We always come for the buffalo rolls/balls and the Cesar salad is our favorite. Great quality food and quick service."
$3 fish tacos were really nice & I would come back for them. The Asian slaw was delicious & has me craving more as I type. \n\nThe outdoor seating is lovely with overhead string bulb lights & a fountain which would make for a romantic setting in the evenings. I did notice the service was quite slow so make sure you're not in a rush.\n\nIt's a bit expensive for a meal but you're getting nice quality fish and goodies. They have a small beer & wine selection in addition to sodas.
"Hubby and I used to come here all the time and we've always had good experiences. Lately when I've been on that side of town and wanted sushi, I'd go to Temari, remembering how good it used to be.\n\nNot anymore -- I made excuses for their decline in standards.\n\nI'm not sure if that sushi chef was being trained, etc, but the rolls were a bit off -- they fell apart easily and the fish just didn't taste as fresh as I remember it being. The rice for the sushi tended to fall apart far too easily -- that was pissing me off. I had more rice in my soy sauce dipping bowl than on the actual sushi roll itself. Yea, I was pretty peeved, but that was nothing compared to what had happened minutes before...\n\nTheir sushi menu is a bit confusing as well. I am used to a menu where you can check things off on the left hand side of the column, not the far right. I made the mistake of checking the box off to the left, thinking I was ordering california rolls and an eel roll. Imagine my surprise when sashimi arrived instead of nigiri.\n\nThey charged me for my mistake. It was an honest mistake and frankly, I love sashimi, but I've recently had a bad experience with sashimi in California that left me feeling like I was hovering close to death...I was in zero mood for raw fish. What should have cost me about $18 in sushi ended up being $30 for my mistake...lunch there used to cost me somewhere between $15-$20, including tip. When all was said and done, the bill was $42 for 2 people...and my cousin hadn't even ordered sushi!\n\nMy cousin had ordered the chicken teriyaki which she said tasted like they had just straight out added corn flour to soy sauce. She said she'd never had a bigger salt lick in her life. The chicken was overcooked and the only thing I *think* she enjoyed was the salad on her plate...oh and the rice that came with the meal.\n\nThe end of the meal came with complimentary ice cream -- as if that could make me think about coming back here again.\n\nThe service was fine, but I found the tables a bit sticky...like they didn't wipe it down well enough. I had forgotten how cramped it felt in there until I stepped through the doors.\n\nSayonara Temari...you lost a once faithful customer. I discovered Sakana and Four Seasons."
"I can count on one hand how many times I have been to Old Chicago. In fact, I can count on two fingers how many times I have been to Old Chicago. \nThe most recent time will be my last.\nOur server was rude, forgetful and unorganized. \nI wanted to take advantage of the reverse happy hour, as well as my friends. We had a few questions about the menu and specials. However, our waiter didn't want to answer many of the questions and made us feel like an inconvenience. Once we placed our order, we waited for over 30 minutes for it to arrive. When the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm, overcooked and tasted like bad leftovers. My friend received the wrong soup, which I wasn't too surprised as the waiter was clearly not paying attention to anything when we let him know what we would like. \nAfter requesting the right soup, we waited another 20 minutes for that until the waiter showed up and asked if we would like tequila shots. Uhm... No tequila shots-- just the right soup please. Mind you, this was second time he asked if we wanted to buy shots. Are you a When the soup arrived it looked like baby food.\nbartender? What is this place?\nStop the world!! I want off!!\n\nThe waiter didn't remove the soup from the bill, he was clearly frustrated as we requested our checks immediately. \n\nBad food. Bad service. Bad tip. Bad restaurant."
Best sandwiches I have ever had!!! I eat here every time I'm in Vegas. I was in Vegas last week for three days and went every single day. Their tuna melt is out of this world -- ask them to add mustard to it -- YUM! The bread is killer and it's only $5.95 for any sandwich and open 24 hours. I'm never up early enough for breakfast which is only served until 11am (why is it always like that in Vegas?!? Who is up that early in Vegas?) but I'm dying to try it!
"Memories memories memories\n\nI have so much fond memories here.  The club is swanky and is really good with treating the girls =).  My favorite thing... playing on the pole.  Mental pictures, no cameras please =)"
"The girl behind the counter was very welcoming and pleasant. She asked us how our weekend was going - a little thing that goes a long way for a quality experience. The restaurant was very clean, which was confirmed by their 99.0 sanitation rating on the wall. Great place & we will definitely come back!"
"I ordered a vegi wrap and fries to go, got back up to the room and found they didn't include the fries (which I watched him ring up as an extra charge). If you charge $23 for wrap and fries I expect it to be good... disappointing."
"I do not believe how this place got the rating that it has. I got burnt, over cook shumai, precooked and dried out chicken.  Food is bad to go along with the unhelpful order taker.  I will not be back."
"I just indulged myself with Dinner for the first time at Verrado Grille last night, and I must say that it was a great experience under the circumstances. \n\nThey close at 9 pm and we got there at about 8:30, so I was expecting poor service because of our timing. Our waitress was nice, and the service was still good for being almost closing time. \n\nI had a pint of Verrado Ale (which is 8th street from Four Peaks) and ordered the Almond Encrusted Basa, which was a beautifully cooked white fish with this delicious Orzo/Risotto side. \n\nThe price is right about ball park for the level of quality you get, I would even pay up a little more for it. \n\nOverall it was a great experience and I would recommend that you aim for a sunset dinner, as the view over the golf coarse and the white tank mountains is amazing during that time."
"The food is very mediocre.  The step down out the front door needs to be addressed.  My wife was carrying my 2 year old daughter  and they both fell and landed pretty badly.  The floor drops down about 6 inches right outside the door.  Needless to say my daughter hit her head on the concrete and sustained quite a bump.  The manager got us some ice and a towel, but I would have liked a little more assistance and verification that we were going to be ok.\n\nIt's troubling that our society is so sue happy, that it's the first thing the restaurant thinks of and tries to distance themselves from the situation and fails to respond in a decent manner.\n\nFix your front door!  You have it painted so you realize it's an issue.  A few bags of concrete and some labor and your entry can actually be safe!\n\nIf you are in the area Greasewood Flats is a much better choice!"
"After a 2nd visit I think its safe to say I give this place 5 stars!!  Came for a late lunch early dinner last Saturday.  Were sat in the downstairs area again, so I still have no clue what it looks like upstairs, but I like the downstairs so no complaints.  \n\nWe tried the prosciutto crostini again and decided on the scallops to start.  Both were great, scallops were served with crushed peanuts and a lightly dressed arugula salad.  The peanuts gave a sweetness that went well with the saltiness of the scallop.\n\nThen we had the mussels and the frites, with honey mustard.  I mentioned bathing in the mussel broth to my sister I believe, its soo good!!  Frites were great again.  And we also tried another new one, the steak skewers.  Really good, well cooked and well seasoned and they serve it over a sweet chilli sacue.\n\nBrownie for dessert, it was good but I felt it should have been serve warm.  We only had sodas but our server was attentive and made sure she kept us refilled and checked on us enough without being in our face.  \n\nAll in all another extremely enjoyable, very reasonably priced meal...I will be back!!"
"Good local spot tucked away beyond the strip. Small dance floor, hookah's, Live bands are just a few things that they have to offer."
I like Miracle Mile Better... We had 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks 28.00 ... Who charges 2.18 for a drink... They were cheap on the BBO...
note that the 2star rating is just compared to all resturaunts not just hawaiin ones. \nfood was good. i dont know my way around hawaiin cuisine so who knows? i just know it tasted good but left me with a fast food feeling afterwards. \n atmosphere was like.. nah just do take out. the atmosphere is like an uncomfy mcdonalds made of fake bamboo with pictures of kids in bikinis. srsly kinda creepy.
"So this is a really cheap golf course.. It is fine for beginners. \n\nIt is not in the best shape. It is what it is.\n\nThey have a range as well... They have carts for the course.\n\nIt is short.. \n\nDoubtful I would go back. But for people starting out, it should work for them."
Will never be going back to RA on Mill Ave.  Came here this last Saturday night with a couple friends and had the worst experience ever.  I ordered the lobster spring rolls as I was not that hungry.  After over an hour and a couple drinks I NEVER EVEN GOT MY FOOD.  No manager came to apologize for the service but they sent out the cook to say he was the only one working and is really backed up.  Why would they send the cook out to talk to us when he was so backed up?  Worst part is after NEVER getting the food I ordered when getting my check they CHARGED me for the food I never received!  After pointing this out to the waitress she took the food off my menu but still did charge me for the one drink I had.   Still dont know where any of the managers where during this.\n\nThis is also my first yelp review as I dont like to bash resteraunts but this experience deserved it.
Best Subway on this side of town.  Everyone speaks English too which helps.  The only annoying thing is it seems like they are always training someone on the cash register which slows things down a lot when there's only two employees working. They make my sandwich quicker than they check me out sometimes so for that they lose one star.
"Excellent service, bread was hot and fresh, pizza cooked to perfection and price was very reasonable"
"Stuffy, sticky air, like back in the day before casinos discovered circulating fresh air. Needs new carpet (adds to the smellyness). Crab cakes were very gluey (I don't understand the raves for these. They're nothing like the real-deal lump crab meat crab cakes). The fried bread is good, but the \""raspberry puree,\"" while tasty, is not actually raspberry puree - its the red goo that's used in jelly donuts. Red, raspberry-flavored corn syrupy stuff. Whatcha gonna do. This is super basic, generic breakfast food. Perhaps the owner doesn't care to watch the food network and maybe get some new ideas or up the quality game so he can get better reviews and then more business. Just sayin... \n\nTwo stars for nice waitress, good service, fresh coffee.\n\nOwner doesn't accept Radio Shopping Show or Entertainment Book coupons anymore, fyi. Be aware.\n\nOverall, I am not motivated to return for any reason."
"While both the food and atmosphere are spot on for a Korean \""Barstaurant\"", the service is the only thing really that needs to be knocked here. Relatively understaffed, it feels like it can be a chore to get the attention of one of the waiters. It's always difficult to be harsh on a staff that's working hard but just doesn't have enough manpower, but they need probably one more worker during busier hours to handle the place.\n\nThe food here is authentically flavored. Their kimchi fried rice(7$) is very good, as is their dolsot bibimbap(10$) and kimchi pancake. Additionally, their dumplings are a little unique but very tasty. I also had their rabokki($10) (spicy rice cakes with ramen noodles) and the dish was unbelievably large, but too spicy for me, which is pretty rare!\n\nThe beer prices are low at 13 dollars for a pitcher, and the small cups leads to idiocy like chugging races. They also have flavored soju, but I haven't managed to try those yet.\n\nA mix of Korean k-pop and mainstream American pop plays on their system, though it was a little louder than I prefer. Don't come here for a quiet, formal meal, that's for sure."
"I came to this cleaners for a bridesmaid dress to be altered and I was extremely happy with it.  Since I live close by I figured I would try the Dry Cleaning side of.  I will NEVER EVER come back to this place again.  I feel like I was totally ripped off.  \n\nI dropped my clothes off on a Thursday and she said to pick them up on Tuesday.  (Open all weekend so why so long).  I came in today Tuesday at 4pm.  She told me they JUST STARTED working on my items and she would call me when they would be ready.  1 hour later she said they were ready.  I picked them up, took them home and this is when I get heated.  \n\nMy Herve Leger dress I dropped off was the only thing that looked cleaned.  I had black shoe polish stains on it from an event I had attended and lucky for me they came out and the dress looked brand new.  I made such a stink about this dress to the older Asian lady at the front of the store, she knew I was going to make sure this dress was spotless when I came back.  All my other shirts still had water stains on them and they looked dirty still.  It looked like all my other items were just pressed so they looked like they were treated.  I think they ran out of time and got lazy and so they cleaned the Herve Leger dress and just pressed the other items to save time and to rip me off! I called as soon as I got home and noticed all of this and the same lady played dumb with me.  She said I could come back the next day and they would fix it but as I told her before, I was going out of the country and needed these items.  She then said to bring them in when I get back and they will correct the issue but to be honest, after reading others reviews on this place, I do not trust Sparkle Cleaners.  I'll take a loss on this and go back to my other dry cleaners across town.   Save yourself the trouble people!!"
"Just moved into a new home this summer.  Old home had a SW Greens putting green complete with T Box and sand trap we hated to leave behind.  Well, we called SW Greens and Scott came out and designed a better putting green than in the old home.  We love it.  Great knowledgeable design followed up by an excellent installation team.  These guys do a first rate job and they are competitively priced.\nThanks SW Greens for our great new putting green!"
"I'm not one to write a bad yelp normally as I understand how damaging they can be. My negative review of the budget rent a car at the Phoenix airport is mainly about the rudest individual working there that I have ever come in contact with. We picked up our car at 145pm on Friday, November 7, 2014.  I made our reservation through costco travel as I do most times when we go somewhere as their rates are the best. I had my confirmation loaded in my trip it App on my phone. Their system at this location of taking a number and being seated to wait your turn was great! No standing in line, instead comfortably seated in the waiting area waiting for your number to be called. This took about 15 minutes. Not horrible. Unfortunately my pleasant experience ended there. I was asked to go to a window where agent Barb was to help me. She was unable to locate our reservation. I showed her my confirmation on my phone and she immediately told me it was not their confirmation number. I advised that I had booked through costco to which she rudely responded, \""we aren't the only company they use, try next door\"". I assured her the reservation was with budget but she insisted I was mistaken and again suggested I go next door. I began looking through my emails to find the confirmation to see if it included budgets confirmation number. When I found the email, I handed over my phone to her. She scrolled through it then shoved my phone in my face and said, look, this is OUR confirmation number not the other one you gave me. What difference does it make? Do you have a reservation or not? She was now able to locate the reservation and proceeded. Never was there an apology or explanation. Next I had to endure what can not be described as anything other than badgering me into additional insurance. I understand they encourage their workers to do this and may even bonus them on their success in some way. I get that. But when I say no thank you six times, I truly don't want it! She went on to make me feel like a degenerate for not taking it as it could cost tens of thousands of dollars if something were to happen. This is easily at least the hundredth car I've rented over the years and I'm very clear on the risk of using my own insurance over theirs. I didn't need schooling from this rude individual. I would definitely rent from budget again as everything other than barb was terrific. Just a heads up if you find yourself at this location standing in front of barb, I'd suggest passing your turn and waiting for the next agent!"
"First, the cheap PURFUME is so STRONG and PUMPED throughout the place.. it overpowers everything and hits you like a ton of bricks when you walk in each time you enter.\n\nSecond, the rooms are dated, run down and not very clean. (we were in three different 'suites' and all were rundown.)\n\nThird, There was 3ftx3ft area of black chunky MOLD on inside of the sheets and we had to change rooms because they couldnt get housekeeping to come change the bed. waited and waited. Tired and ready for bed but did the move in order to get to sleep. (took pictures of mold)\n\nFourth, The new room had a man's whiskers all over the bathroom and covered the round magnatized mirror in the bathroom off the wall  ..which I touched before I realized. The new room also had quarter sized holes in the new sheets that looked like a rodent had gnawed. Moved again in the morning. (have pictures grosse!)\n\nLast, moved to a room with a \""view\"" but the windows were so dirty you could barely see out. (sounds crazy but really true)\n\nI think the place will be out of business soon, but until it does, I wanted to warn others of these conditions."
"For the food, price & service this place has to be the best gyro restaurant in Avondale. It's a little hidden gem in this neighborhood. Food is always good. The service is always fantastic. The two young men behind the counter are always friendly & efficient. Definitely one of my favorite places!"
If you come here to dine in close to closing time DO NOT sit in the back section or you will get scolded by the Latina hussie behind the counter.
They finally closed. I believe this was the first A.J.'s in Arizona......and the past few years it slowly went downhill.
"So far it's been a very bad experience and the hotel Manager Jonathan made it even worse.  We paid using points which doesn't seem to go over well here.  We booked a room with 2 double beds, but were told at check in that all they had available was a king bed.  We proceeded to our room and walked in the door and were floored by how bad it reeked of smoke.\n\nWe called the front desk and after wating 15 minutes, we asked for a Manager.  One of the rudest persons I've spoken to in the Service Industry (the Manager's name was 'Jonathan') told us that because we used points, we can't ask for a specific type of room.  He also told us that the smoking floor was the 19th floor and we were on the 11th, so it wasn't the hotel's fault if someone smoked in that room.  He basically told us to screw off and hung up.\n\nWe then tried to leave the hotel, but they couldn't or wouldn't reimburse the points we used so we are stuck here.  Nightmare."
So I will start off by saying about a month ago I was yelling to the TOP of my lungs everyone needs to visit the Fremont Casino its my favorite place!!!  They have the best tables!\n\nSadly I had a horrible experience and it has permanently changed my views of this place. I was playing at the Craps table ($3) and this very loud group next to me was playing and the man next to me on multiple occasion kept thinking my money was his. So in my mind I am like why aren't these people doing anything to prevent this? So it got so bad that they actually had to go look at the tape.\n\nSo here is my real issue. The man argued to the staff that it was his money on the table and I was nicely sad that it was mine but the game in no way could be stop while the conflict got resolved. So Money that no one could confirm sat on the table when all I wanted to was grab my money and leave. The Manager on duty Monica  was so rude to me she did look at the tape (for 10-15 mins) and saw that it was my money and when I asked for my $3 back YES $3 that they couldn't confirm that was mine she tried to tell me I was trying to get over and scamming them. I WAS LIKE ARE YOU SERIOUS you guys make $3 in 0.02 seconds and you can't afford to give me $3???? She told me I had to make an appointment to speak to someone higher than her. the customer service was TERRRRIBLE and it did not stop there.\n\nThe next morning I called and asked to speak to the Operations Manager and he got on the phone and told me he would take a look at it and give me a call back and pretty much said what do you want and we cant give you anything more than $3. I NEVER HEARD FROM THIS MAN EVER AGAIN! \n\nand I made it clear if you would've given me the stinking $3 I would've given it right back to you at the craps table. \n\n\nJust be careful at this place... I am so sad that this happened to me at my FAVORITE place.
"I came here with a few coworkers for lunch, and was very impressed.\nWe were seated on the second floor which was spacious and had an amazing atmosphere.\n\nThe dining space reminded me of a combination old west and a medieval festival in Europe. You can see old horse carriage wheels hung on the walls, some wooden barrels, and a knight armor in the corner. Pretty cool! \n\nFor lunch, I had a parmesan chicken salad sandwich which used a French croissant instead of bread. It was amazing and very fresh. Also their French fries were delicious with very crispy batter! \n\nI can wait to be back here on a Friday or Saturday night, I heard the first floor is a pub-type bar, and the second floor turns into a club with live DJ. \n\nI will keep you posted!"
"Loved our stay at The Platinum Hotel.\n\nI truly appreciate this hotel is smoke and casino free.  After long nights at the blackjack table your lungs yearn for fresh air and there is nothing better than hitting the hay in a smoke free environment.\n\nStaff here is superb - top notch and will go out of their way to take care of you.  A little  off the beaten path, it is a walk to the strip.  During the day its no problem - at night you should probably take a cab.\n\nThe room was fantastic (not much smaller than my house - haha)  Having a fridge at your disposal is key.  We always stock up on water immediately and its nice to have chilled water without having to use your trash can as an ice bucket (yes we have done this many times at other strip places).  The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is luxurious - double sinks, jacuzzi tub and a beautiful tiled shower.  For 2 people i truly felt like i was home.  Definitely a great place for families and extended visits!\n\nWe will be back for sure and would recommend without hesitation."
"This place is AMAZING. My friends and I had the best meal we've ever eaten, here. We received great service, as well, including a table visit from the Executive Chef. This is, by far, the best steak place we've ever eaten.  If you go to Vegas, do NOT miss this place."
"I drop by this Chevron from time to time.  It gets very busy during the daytime.  I used to come here more frequently, but I find that sometimes they're out of premium unleaded, but I don't know until I pull up to the pump and see a little note on the pump.  That irritates me.  However, when I need gas and I'm in the area, I have no choice.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%"
"Great frozen yogurt, good prices. Tons of topping choices, staff is always nice, love the retro feel of the inside."
Poor access from monorail. Poor restaurant qualities and diversity. Poor lobby (only twos gents working at front desk with loads of people in line). Poor bell desk (took 30 mins to get to my room to give me new access cards to give to me to change my room...since the room next to me was noisy with partygoers). Old dirty carpeting. Basic bathroom. Avoid this hotel. Stay at MGM
So stoked to find such a great gyro place in Chandler. can tell the guy's from Chicago too... I haven't tried the italian beef but I will. I'm just sticking to the gyro's and plates for now.\n\nI've now been there at least 20 times... and still loving it. \n\nI am sorry to see such a horrible web site.. sad. but... that's not at all what to expect with their food.
"I think people give this place 4 or 5 stars because they WANT to like it, and want to feel worldly and cosmopolitan. My primary complaint with this place is that it is far too expensive for what it is. \n\nI ordered one of the chicken entrees, at $14.95, and it tasted fine- nothing special though, and I was still hungry after devouring it. So hungry that I went and had two slices at Ian's.  It was just one chicken breast with some sauce and a small patch of rice. It also came with a small bowl of soup, which was flavorless. This is not a fancy place- it's basically a cafeteria, which is fine by me, but why the fine dining prices and small portions? I'm amazed that people in Madison are willing to pay these prices for such small portions. I should say, also, that I very rarely leave a restaurant still hungry, so it's not like I have a super sized appetite."
"Four stars for the two appetizers (calamari and spicy shrimp)' both were very enjoyable.  The salad was also very good.  \nOne star for the main entrees.  Both mine and the wife's were awful.  I had the tilapia with asparagus.  The asparagus was way over cooked the the fish was very dry.  Wife had a pasta dish and was very disappointed. The kids meals were okay.\nAtmosphere wasn't very appealing since areas were dirty in the waiting area and the dining area near the fireplace.  Wait staff was very inconsistent, our waiter was very neglectful, while the waitress at the table next to us seemed very attentive to her tables and we had to ask her for refills on bread, salad and drinks while our waiter was MIA.\nBottom line, go somewhere else while in the Concord Mills area."
"Although only 4 year round beers and 1 rotating tap, beer is solid and cheap (less than 6 bucks for a half liter, less than 10 for a liter).  The pretzels are delicious, and the potato soup is awesome.  I would only go when weather is good enough for outdoor seating because it is on the river and has a great view, also because inside is too rowdy with a lot of drunk assholes in the beer hall.  It gets so bad on weekends that police officers wait outside for any issues that arise in the beer hall."
"The best pho in town! Been getting my hangover cure here for a very long time! Than, the sweet cashier girl is always so nice and remebers you everytime! \nMy favorites are:\nShrimp chips and spring rolls as an ap.\nLarge rare beef pho, beef on side and extra limes.\nyummmmmmmmy!"
"I had the good fortune to have my birthday dinner here tonight and it was really one of the best meals I have ever had....really.\n\nI opted for the dover sole that was deboned table side...(gasp). I mean who goes to a steakhouse to have fish,right?  It was cooked to perfection. \n\nDefinitely the place for a special night out...the view is gorgeous."
"Every single time we fly to Vegas, we always make sure we make a stop at Lee's for our party rock liquor! lol!\n\nI swear this is the biggest liquor store i have ever stepped in & they even have tasters too!\n\nI always end up buying more bottles than I should (not necessarily a \""bad\"" thing if you are planning to party in Sin City..hehe) because I always want to try something new since they have so many bottles I haven't even seen (or tasted!) before. *^_^*\n\nAmong their selections they have giant bottles of Grey goose and the largest variety of mini bottles to purchase."
"The pizza wasn't horrible,  but the deal was awful.  The prices are extremely high at Dominos in general,  and their medium 2 topping is a rip off.  Low rating is for price vs.  Quality,  and value."
"I really was hoping that I would like Harley's, as it is super close to us and would be the perfect neighborhood Italian place. Unfortunately, I was rather underwhelmed by today's experience. This is the first time I have actually been inside. I heard that it has recently been redone, so I cannot compare it to prior, but I thought the place looked rather inviting. Unfortunately, the food is just not that good. We had the calamari fritti, which I consider a safe choice. They did not taste bad - they tasted like nothing at all. I tried putting lemon on them, then marinara sauce, then salt. Finally I dipped them in olive oil. Each time it made them more memorable, but not more edible. We also tried the pizza (both the Italian meat pizza and the pesto chicken one). If I had bought a frozen pizza at the store and it tasted like that fresh out of the oven I would have thought of it as pretty good pizza and probably bought it again. However, I expect more of an Italian restaurant, especially considering how long it took to prepare (and there was only one other couple in the entire place). \nOverall, I am just disappointed. This place has great potential. I'm not saying I'll never come back. Maybe I'll have better luck with a pasta dish in the future. I just know it won't be for a while."
"Fast and furious. Can I use that for an oil change reference? \n\nThis is my first time to hit up a Jiffy Lube so I had no idea what to expect, other than it should be done in a jiffy, right? I usually get my oil change at the mechanic during inspection and usually when my car breaks (a couple times a year). So to say I'm not up on my oil changes is an understatement (shhh don't tell my dad!). \n\nBut honestly, this might make me actually be on time with them knowing how easy it was. I came in during the week around 11:30am. I know, I'm lucky to be able to do this during the week to begin with. There were probably about 3 people ahead of me. 15-20 minutes later I was out the door!\n\nBonus, they have free wifi! So I sat with my computer and worked while I waited. An oil change was $29.99. That's just the basic. I had a couple other extras done (coolant, wipers changed, etc.) so it ended up costing me more than just the change, but I didn't think it was too bad. \n\nNow maybe my car won't break as often (not likely). Here's hoping!"
"My husband, son, daughter and I went for a Sunday lunch. My little girl who is only 2 did not want to sit still and cried so we left so other people could actually enjoy their lunch. Husband went back to pick up our lunch so we could enjoy it at home. We were very pleased. We will be back."
"Wow....where do I start. We headed to Las Vegas to celebrate my 40th birthday and because I love sushi I wanted to experience it Las Vegas style. I went onto Yelp to see what people had to say and discovered Sushi Roku. I literally read through each and every review to see what the hype was all about. Everyone kept talking about how great the wait staff was and how if its your birthday you get even \""better\"" treatment. \nWe showed up for our dinner reservations (and the host staff and wait staff was aware at this time that it was my birthday) and the two hostesses were so cold to my party. We then were seated at a window seat which was great I have to admit, the views were wonderful. \nThe \""waitress\"" finally after about 8 minutes decided to grace us with her presence and didn't introduce herself to us and blankly took our drink order. My first thought was \""wow she is so not personable\"". It proceeded to go down from there. The food arrived so that one person was eating like 10 minutes before any of the other food arrived for the table. She never gave us the time of day but was working the other tables. Finally one of my friends asked her if she was aware it was my birthday and with a cold glare she said \""yes\"". At that point I was ticked, you would think as a wait person (which I have done for years in my past professions) that you would try a little harder for the tip you EXPECT to receive from a group. \nNeedless to say I approached the manager on the way out and told him that I felt very disappointed in my experience there and obviously they should look at their staff members. I would never go back there based on my experience. If you do try it good luck hopefully you get someone nice but dont expect anything special even on your birthday."
"GREAT lunch at Julian Serrano..me and my fiancee's last meal before leaving LV. Every single thing we put into our gaping maws we loved......lobster gazpacho, goat cheese-stuffed piquillo peppers, fried potatos with chorizo and fried eggs, seafood-saffron rice, bread with tomato and machego cheese, tuna/raspberry skewers, lobster/pineapple skewers....I definetily want to come back for dinner when they have a more extensive menu. The pitcher of sangria we got was $$$$ at 44 bucks, but it was huuuuugge. Service was very good and our server made good recommendations."
"I had my birthday dinner here. It was my first time. I was not disappointed. I had the filet it was so good.  I could cut the steak with a butter knife. For desert, I had the ultimate cheese cake.  It was massive and delicious."
"4:10 PM - room 1 - high-pitched whirring noise in ceiling, thought I could call to get it fixed\n4:30 PM - after 20 minutes of phone hold, sent to another room where my key would work and security would be there in five minutes to let us in. \n5:00 Pm - after 10 minutes in the hallway waiting for security because the cards didn't actually work, and 20 minutes on hold with the front desk asking for security, we learn that room 2 was smoked in, so no go for us non-smokers. When the front desk was informed that someone had smoked in the room, they reacted with disbelief\n5:20 PM - front desk guy says he'll waive $80 in fees, and give us what he says is a slightly nicer room. When I said this was pretty poor compensation for making guests sit in a hallway for most of an hour, front desk guy literally said that was too bad and I should just stay where I was. \n5:30 PM - into room 3. It had a visibly stained bedspread. While the nice housecleaning lady fixed it over 20 minutes, come on. \n\nThis place isn't five stars. It's not even a Hampton Inn if consistency and courtesy count for anything.  I wouldn't stay here again and I would recommend anyone else think hard about staying somewhere else. \n\nLook, it may be a busy day for the hotel. But, there's no excuse for thirty minute hold times to speak to the front desk and there's no excuse for discourtesy. I've never been so frustrated with a hotel."
I always get friendly customer service here. And they have a lot of real fruit drinks here. I think they are one of the best places for boba drinks.
"I've ordered delivery twice for papa John's.  both times my pizza was delivered at room temperature. The second pizza was even free courtesy of the manager because of it. and both times I was told that it would take 45-60mns and took close to 2hrs. I was accommodated for my dissatisfaction, so the reason for me writing this is not to come down on the staff, but there needs to be a change. Maybe they need to hire more people or whatever unless they want to keep giving away free pizzas."
"Guy Fieri needs a slap in the face! \n\nThe Four Kegs has the worst customer service I have ever seen. The waitress we had was slooowww and very forgetful. It was as if she was on medication or something worse. We arrived during off peak hours for dinner, 9 pm. \n\nAfter a 45 minute wait the first  of five strombolis  made it to our table--all the strombolis arrived at different times (5-10 minutes apart). Very uncomfortable to watch other folks eat. One stromboli never made it to the table, we had to flag down our medicated waitress to check on the order (which she forgot to put in). Our waitress also forgot to put in our appetizer order--we reminded her and it came after the meal. \n\nThe one forgotten stromboli finally made it to our table AFTER everyone completed their meals, and it was ICE-COLD in the middle. \n\nThe manager never compensated us or apologized for THEIR screw-ups. Very disappointing.\n\nGuy Fieri should be ashamed of himself for highlighting this dive on TV, he lost a lot of credibility with all of us.\n\nOh, and the stromboli and appetizer (fried mac and cheese) was just average, nothing to brag about."
"I was expecting to walk into a little fast food dive.  To my surprise, this place is an actual full service restaurant.  It's still kind of a dive, but I was pretty shocked to have a hostess seat me, a waitress serve me, and a bar with a random waterfall-like display for food at the prices that I saw online.  A pleasant treat almost as good as the food.\n\nMy only disappointment about my meal is I ordered the the tiny torta.  I had the ranchera del pollo; chicken, guacamole, chipotle mayo and cheese.  Very good, and perfect for its price at $7.25, but when I saw waitresses carrying the ridiculously stacked tortas, I have to admit I was hoping mine would be at least close to those.  But I should have known from the short description and cheap price that I was going to get the tinny-tiny sandwich.  My brother ordered a Del Rey.  This awesome monstrosity of a sandwich is stacked with just about every breakfast item you can imagine.  He usually eats healthy, but he enjoyed every bite he was able to take of it (although this was was one of the big ones and he could only manage half).\n\nOne thing kind of bugs me for some odd reason.  Potato chips as a side seems kind of random.  I know that tortas are sandwiches, but why isn't a mexican place serving tortilla chips?  Just wondering."
"We were very unimpressed with our stay at Paris. We stayed only one night with the kids on our way to Ca. The valet guy was rude-expected a tip no matter what the service! The air condition went out in the casino area- and when I called front desk he just says it happens there in summer. The crepes were way overpriced...three crepes, 2 slices of pizza, 2 beers, 2 sodas $65! The room was cramped, armoire broken, TV not viewable from both beds, and the shampoo sucked. Only one pool, 3 ft in all areas- just for toddlers. My hubby & I recently stayed two nights at Venetian- so much better. I plan to write management a letter but realize gone are the days when great food, drinks and service were a Vegas given - plan to be stripped of your last dollar before you even get to the tables!"
"*** Kosher  Chabad of Southern Nevada ***\n\nI am in Las Vegas from time to time and I have been going to this restaurant for years spanning several owners.  My last trip, I stopped in expecting the usual avergae - good pizza \""joint\"" fare -didn't happen.  \n\nAlthough the proprietress was... homey and friendly, she was more interested in talking on the phone than waiting on me even though I said I was in a rush.  The place was empty and tables dirty and piled with dishes from lunch rush I guess.  The Air conditioning was NOT ON (Vegas can be quite hot) and in general the place was not impressive.  I asked for slices (in a hurry) no slices, I asked what was fast \""everything takes the same time\"" so I ordered a fallafel figuring how long could that take...  I watched as the guy in the kitchen made the Israeli salad veg by veg thinking that couldn't possibly be for me... after all I was in a hurry -yeah right.  I had to eat quick (and in the car) on my way to my next customer so I asked for no techina sauce -again, yeah right.  So hurrying to my customer eating at red lights the thing became a soggy mess.\n\nIt was WAY overpriced (IMHO) and the place is NOT suitable for a business lunch.\n\nAlso, the coup de grace, was ill the rest of the day -yes from the food but decorum prohibits me from relating the details here...\n\nI will not be going back...."
"Whenever I have extra time at lunch, I cruise over to this place. I love the spicy coconut soup with added veggies or the peanut butter chicken. Service was great as well. I have no complaints about this places so i gave it a 4 star."
"Great place with a personal touch! The owners always remember my name- and the food is very good as well. I've only had their breakfast, and need to try lunch here.  It is a very clean and well-maintained place to go, and the prices are reasonable. The Esplanade needed other alternatives to Starbucks and this restaurant really fits the bill. Recommended!"
This place has the best breakfast burrito in town! They're a little on the pricey side but well worth the money and on some days (Sunday?) they're a dollar off. Everyone who has ever taken my order has been polite and friendly. I want to try something else on the menu but the breakfast burrito is too good to pass up!  Love this place!
"Being in a casino, you're rarely encouraged to leave.  This is the place you want to eat at odd hours that pretty much has everything. I'm a big fan of all day breakfast, and will order it at all chances if given the opportunity.\n\nMr. Lucky's is a old school diner in the casino (think johnny rockets, just crappier).  The casino actually has about 5 some odd restaurants, but I think this is the only one open at weird hours.\n\nOne thing I always get at breakfast is pouched eggs (cause I like them).  The thing that kinda bugs me about some restaurants is that they steam them into this little perfect briquette of a egg.  This is NOT how to poach an egg...  I mean, how hard is it to boil water with vinegar in it?\n\nI also got the ham.  The piece of ham I got was about 1.5cm thick.  Seriously gigantic in terms of breakfast portions.  Apparently this is where you get ham steaks in vegas at breakfast.\n\nAll in all with the price through the roof (it is vegas...) and the mediocre food, I'd probably recommend going somewhere else.  There's a coffee shop that has sandwiches on the other side of the casino.  Go there... end of story."
"This is my first time writing a review, and I did it because I had such a bad experience at this hotel.\n\nI got my stay here through another website i think it was hotels.com (not sure though) it was a good deal. 6 nights/7days king size bed with air conditioning and a fridge. Turned out it was at the manors not even connected to the hotel. I decided to upgrade when checking in. The lady was real nice about it and got us the upgrade real easy. Had to wait around about an hour or two because there card system was down.\n\nFrom first glance, the hotel looks grimy, old, and wore out.  Same is said of the inside. It's stuffy everywhere and smells of smoke (which isn't to big of an issue for me)\n\n I went and got my key and went to pick up my luggage because I didn't want to carry it around with me, so I left it at the luggage hold area. No one was at the desk! and their were 4 other people waiting by the time I got there. 20 minutes passed before a lady showed up and started getting people their luggage. smallest quantity at a time. I had 5 so I had to wait until she got through all 4 other people. (she looked super annoyed with her job and looked like she didn't want to be here at all. no care about the customers/clients/guests)\n\nGet up to my room on 6th floor. My room is small with a small bathroom and a door to the adjacent room?? (Security risk any?) air conditioning didn't work, fan had mold on it, of course I didn't realize that until I started to get sick a day later from having it run. No fridge in my room like the deal said. Oh did I say I was put in a smoking room on a nonsmoking floor? because it was the only one available for upgrade. Well after a terrible night's rest, and getting sick from the mold they moved me down the hall to a new room.\n\nLooks Identical. only they gave me a fridge and a working air conditioner and no door to the adjacent room. Yet the room is placed in a similar location where my last room was, so whats up with that? the view from both rooms is terrible. You mostly look at a building in front of you and the roof of the main building area below you.\n\nThe Buffet Review: 1/5\n\nOver Priced, terrible selection of foods, and even worse in the taste department.  After waiting in line for about 10 minutes which isn't to bad for lunch time. I got seated and went to look at the foods.  Wide selection of choices they do have.\n\nMy first plate consisted of Mashed potatoes w/ gravy, fried chicken wings, mac & cheese, x2 sausage links, and toast.  The wings, M&C, and potatoes were yucky. tasted like 3 day old KFC, because 2 day old KFC tastes better! The sausage links were cold in the center and under cooked, and the toast was just plain cold.\n\n2nd plate was a salad with olives, cheddar cheese, and ranch. Because the rest of the salad makings either don't belong on a salad or belong to a separate salad group. the dressings were miss labeled ( I don't think rang is supposed to be orange?) or they weren't labeled at all. The lettuce was dry and warm which salads aren't supposed to be warm.  I also grabbed a plate of sliced cherry pie, my thought was how can you screw up pie?...Circus Circus did! it tasted like that fake pie you make when your to lazy to make your own or to cheap to buy the good stuff for an extra 2 bucks. Plus it was cold. If anything positive came out of the buffet it was the water. Because at least that they got right. Cold and wet!\n\nI'm almost done.  Most of the people here are nice. The room keepers if your lucky enough to get English speakers are pretty nice. Unless they don't understand the word go away, or can't read the do not disturb sign. I was interrupted by several room cleaners on several occasions. They just barge right in without saying anything. I don't think they care to read the do not disturb sign clearly placed on the outside door handle. One of them came in while I was undressing ( which I wouldn't mind if she was attractive, which He wasn't) \n\nThe casino area. It clearly states no minors under the age of 21 allowed in or to loiter in the gaming area. I must have seen several kids sitting on the gambling games next to their parents which is illegal.  I even saw a kid sitting at a black jack table, clearly under the age of 15. The waitress/servers in the casino area are not attractive but instead look like 40 year old ladies in terrible shape who shouldn't be wearing said outfits. Plus their service is terrible, they walk around saying \""drinks? Drinks\"" and they walk so fast you have to yell at them to get there attention. Then you don't see one for at least 20 minutes. cheaper to just sit at the bar. Plus I saw several of these servers just coughing on the drinks they were serving, made me sick knowing they coughed on people's drinks.\n\nOverall a bad stay here. Recommend if your looking for a cheap stay. better staying at a motel or something. Plus some health concerns here!"
"We recently moved into the area and I was looking for some good Chinese food. I thought I'd give this place a try and ordered take-out based on other ppls reviews. When I went to go pick up the food the place was very dingy and dirty looking to me. Had I known the place was going to be this dirty I would never had ordered. But despite this, I thought I'd still give it the benefit of the doubt. I was wrong! So wrong! We ordered orange beef, hot 'n sour soup, and some lo me in. Pretty basic Chinese-American dishes. It was awful. The food was mushy like it had been sitting awhile. It was the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted."
"Located on Fremont Street, and not far from Golden Nugget. This place probably seen better days. \n\nThe only reason why I go here, is for the cheap Deep Fried Twinkies in Las Vegas. Can't beat the 99 cents deep fried Twinkies. Even though, I know its not really good for me, but got to love the deep fried Twinkies. But, they could probably clean up the deep fry station and better customer service. Really didn't need some one telling me \""Don't forget my tip.\"" With that remark, why would I tip you for being some what rude. But I guess 10% of a dollar, is probably all she'll get from me. \n\nBut the place itself, can probably look better, with out the slot machines that doesn't seem to work, time and time again. If the place was just a place to have a deep fried Twinkies and a slushy bar. Then it would be nice. But with the old school slot machines, and not so happy staff. I believe that this could of been a better place with a better review. \n\nIf you're into gambling or putting a quarter in a slot machine, this is not the place to do so, cause you'll probably not get any service or any help, probably in 30-60 minutes later. The slushy drinks and the deep fry station in the back, is probably a good place to get them."
Good food and very friendly service.
"I was expecting more... better... I'm not sure why, but I was. We got a large coffee milk tea with boba and a large peppermint green tea with boba. Hubby liked his coffee milk tea but my peppermint green tea tasted like I had swallowed some spearmint gum. I thought it was supposed to be peppermint? In any case, almost $12 for the two seemed a little pricey. And what's with the attitudes? I felt like I was an inconvenience for asking to place an order. I think I'll go elsewhere for my Boba tea next time."
"I come here twice a week or so Arianna is our favorite server. We are able to eat out more often because their prices are so reasonable. Athena is usually here to take care of any problems, but we've not had any. Come over and see Joni, Nadine Michelle Marline and all the Alexis family there's plenty of booths and they'll treat you right. Be a counter fly if you like. Mike and I will see you there! We've been coming since 2005."
"You gotta love Yard House!!!(or The Yard as I like to call it) me and the whole fam use to be regulars here atleast every 2 or 3 weeks, that was back when my mother-in-law and her boyfriend were together.They would always have us meet them at the Yard every other Friday and holidays(like you would pass up a free meal). We would always order the same thing, The happy hour specials. Its too many items to name but you can look it up and see what it is(Pizza, onion rings, sliders, poke, calamari, fries, etc). All of the items were very good and I would say the Bernaise sliders are my absolute favorite. Some would say they are pretty basic, which I agree, they are. But its the mild yogurt-based dipping sauce that they serve with it that gives me an O-Face everytime I take a bite. Im a slider expert and I dont know about yall, but I like my sliders basic(beef, cheese, onions). None of that foie gras, pork belly, cilantro leaves crap. Keep it simple stupid!! I would also always order the same drink, a St Bernardus 13(14% alcohol, yeah buddy!!!) Cant wait to go back, probably wont be for while since monster-in-law and her boy toy broke up. We'll see tho."
Just got some ink from Eric Ayala. Vintage cowgirl. It's great. Nice guy and a great artist. Will be back for more.
"If I could give this place a negative stars, I would. I witnessed blatant prejudice, discrimination and slight racism. I never got any eye contact from \""Brian\"" and was treated with disregard for an entire 30 minutes. During this time of disgrace, I personally witnessed the bouncers tell ppl they had to get bottle service to get in (aren't attractive enough)  and the best? Informing an inter racial couple (female) she can't get in because she was with a guy who had cornrows. Oh interesting. I might not be a super model, high class escort or name drop out here but I wish I could drop \""Brian \"" and his bouncers with their prejudicial ways off a cliff, discriminating, demeaning, insensitive nobodies!"
I sought out Jamba Juice their highlighted drink with the giant picture- that's what I wanted. But they were missing two of the four ingredients! I'll never go back there again
"I'll rate this place two stars because their casino is actually one of my favorite to play at. It's got a good vibe.\n\nThe rooms however, holy grossness! We stayed here because it was the cheapest centralized hotel we could find on the strip, and we were broke at the time. So for that I guess I can't really complain because you get what you pay for. \n\nWhen we checked into the room I immediately went to use the bathroom since I had been sitting in a car for the 4 hours prior, and the first thing I noticed....someone else's hair on the bathroom floor and a squashed bug in the bathtub. Did the maid service skip this room? yuck!\n\nNext, my fiance and i went and sat down at the foot of the bed, the mattress flipped completely up sending us both to the floor! Nice, way to set off the mood. And if you want to take a nap or sleep in, forget about it....we had a \""nice pool side room.\"" Why is that a problem? The music was playing so loudly from the pool that even with the sliding glass door closed we could STILL feel the bass vibrations and hear the music. \n\nThis hotel is fine if you're looking at cramming 7 college guys into it and maybe plan on spending 2 hours total sleeping in it. But I don't think we'll be coming back to this one."
"For $30 a person this buffet isn't worth it. The items that are being served here don't stand out. Usual pasta, pizza, prime rib, crab legs, salads, etc. The food wasn't horrible but definitely not worth $30. \n\nThe desserts were ok, but as usual there's was nothing that would make me come back. You're honestly better off spending the $30 per person and going to a nearby restaurant within the casino.\n\n5/10 (overpriced)"
Great rooms but that's all. First we have been moved to another room the second night ruining our morning. Barbara at the front desk was rude and unhelpful and made us get crazy to solve a problem they caused! They also messed with our players card and we never saw coffee and newspapers included in the suite price! A beautiful setting ruined by the attitude of the employees.. Will never book it again!
"They have a good selection. Servers are friendly. Food is great except the limited selection for desserts. The last time I went there, the servers at the dessert section were chit-chatting. They know people were waiting but acted like they didn't noticed."
"Where I lost most of my money but this review is for the horrible service I was provided. Sure, the Jabbawockeez show wasn't bad and Britney Spears sat a couple rows behind my sister but this place is so grungy and needs to keep up with the architecture. Come see me at the Bellagio!"
"So get my money on time, if they not money, decline\nI just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind\nNow tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?\nPut that paper over all, I thought you knew that at...JULIAN SERRANO! - Iggy Azalea (fancy)\n\nI would normally never intentionally wait 40 mins for a paella in Vegas (where time is money). Since it was Labor Day weekend, we had more time and because I've walked by this place so many times, we finally decided to try this place for a late lunch. Most of the tapas were strong in flavor, including the steak, but the seafood paella stole the show. The lobster, clams, mussels, and shrimp all blended in together and its a dish we would never be able to replicate correctly at home so bravo! Dessert was also yummy.\n\nI'd recommend a paella and 2-3 tapas a person and you're good to go for a pleasant dining experience!"
"good service during a late lunch. Food was good, and heat level was spot on. good portions. the meat is clearly cooked on the side, then mixed into whatever dish you order, so the meat can be blad or had an odd flavor. Still good, and would put it on my short list of thai spots...there are TONS of thai places here"
"Took 10 minutes to get a sandwich. Corned beef sandwich was supposed to be hot. It was cold. Asked for a bagel to not be toasted. They toasted it. Corned beef was dry, might have been frozen. Never going back."
"Wow, I'm surprised with most of the reviews here because I am in love with this restaurant.  I've been here a good dozen times since it opened and can't get enough.\n\nStart with the grilled artichoke appetizer.  The chef takes a whole (giant) artichoke, removes the choke, steams it until almost done and then finishes it off on the grill.  The artichoke comes out sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and with a mustardy dip on the side.  Amazing.\n\nAlso, the salads are delicious.  My personal favorite is the seared ahi tuna salad.  It comes with a great champagne dressing and a huge serving of sesame encrusted seared tuna.  So good.  The steak cobb salad is also really good with melt in your mouth croutons, avocado and a great dressing.\n\nI've always had great service here and the food is consistently great."
"Ordered the Roasted Veggie and the One Veggie. Both were pretty good although the crust was a bit over baked and a little too thick. The garlic knots are nothing to rave about, but the House Chips I really liked--smoky with a slight kick. Good alternative to Dominos, so we'll be back for sure."
"THE WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!! Beware of Mario, he is out for himself and could give a da** about anything else. Communication is not in his vocabulary because he does not email, call or return any messages. His assistant Tomi is just as bad, you will never get anywhere with this company. We rented a condo with this so called Scottsdale luxury rentals, so obviously maintenance is included with that. It took them 3 days to get someone to fix our air conditioning in 110 degree weather!!! He scheduled a walk through and forgot to mention that is was canceled, he is such a huge inconvenience. When the bills are due if your not on time they will be on your tail calling and emailing.  They are quick to take payment but to return the deposit was impossible. They will take every penny if you let them, get a lawyer by your side, because you will need one!"
"Meh. Sure, the hot dogs are good, and you can get it piled with toppings. But it's quite expensive for what you get!\n\nAnd I was really excited to see they had Poutine on the menu, as my Canadian brethren had told me legends about the stuff. But I came away a little disappointed. Guess I'll have to wait until I end up in Quebec to try it again!"
"The sandwiches are decent at best but the spring rolls here are not good at all compared to the ones in Cali... Wait they just aren't good. The sauce is for lack of a better word \""gross\"" and the spring roll was almost frozen from the cooler they put it in. It doesn't have the vermicelli noodles in it either and no peppers or pickled daikon or carrots... Pretty much a fail all the way around."
I love the food here. Everything i have tried seemed fresh and delicious and tastes good cold the next day for lunch too. My only complaint was the egg rolls. I love egg rolls and they are not very good here so I wouldnt order them for sides. If you like Orange chicken you will not be dissapointed.
Good Breakfast Place.  And only 1.3 miles from my office even better!
"My daughter recently got married at the Mandarian Oriental and since she had seen their afternoon tea service was highly rated we decided to host afternoon tea for a number of the ladies attending the wedding (25 to be exact).  Angela De Cosmo is an amazing event co-coordinator.  The couple had been conversing with Angela over the past  7 months regarding their wedding and when we decided to have a tea party I just emailed Angela and she organized it.  Since we were having so many, she arranged for us to use the Bar room on the 23rd floor for our event which just happened to be where the wedding reception the next evenig was being held. It's almost as gorgeous during the day as it is at night.  The views are staggering. We opted for scones with Devon cream and jam and a variety of pastries with our tea (hot and cold). They were all a big hit and plenty was provided.  At the last minute (same day), I found out two guests only ate glueten-free foods and once again Angela came through.  I only have two issues: the two gluten-free guests were provided with their own plate of only 3 pastries each.  I think there should have been little more and if other guests chose to try one, all the better.  Secondly, I expected the tea to be served in tea pots but instead a variety of tea packets were provided and hot water and guests served themselves. Perhaps this was only because of our numbers but I expected a little more service for the price. All in all, the guests were thrilled with the event and all wished we had dressed up with gloves and hats.  It was a great getting to know you event especially since many were from cities mostly from all over North America but a couple from Europe.  I would recommend afternoon tea at the MO to any brides bringing  a number women together for the first time.  I think it helped make the wedding reception more pleasurable as we had already had an opportunity to meet.  Angela made it so easy to arrange."
Food was decent but the waitstaff absolutely sucks.  Super rude and condescending.  Not worth the time or money.  Stay away.
"Very friendly service and nice atmosphere. They also allowed me to order the kid's bean & cheese burrito, which was only $4 and very large! It was also very good. Hopefully I will be able to return in the future to try more of the menu."
"We came here for dinner the other night and we weren't overly impressed and, honestly, I'm quite surprised by some of the higher reviews. \n\nThe atmosphere was fine; low lighting, decently decorated, but it was much smaller than I had expected. It was also nearly empty when we first got there at 6pm.\n\nService was decent; a couple of the servers were hard to understand but we got by. Now, I understand the whole concept of how the servers will keep coming with the meat  until you turn over the little colorful toy looking thing but it was a bit distracting to have a conversation when the servers are circling around you and interrupting. Maybe it would be better to just bring out a dish of the samplings and if you want more then you could ask for it.\n\nThe salad bar was...okay. It wasn't anything to rave about. I tried a sampling of six different salads; mushrooms, tilapia and tomatoes, chicken salad, egg salad, crab salad, and garbanzo bean salad. Of the six I thought two of them were good; chicken salad and egg salad.\n\nAfter we finished with the salads they started bringing in the meats. Again, we thought they were okay. The beefs were definitely way better than the others. I liked the prime rib, the sirloin, and the fillet, however they were a bit over cooked for my taste but they were seasoned well and moist. Although, the sausage was dry, the ham was so-so, the pork chop was completely dried out, the lamb I didn't care for, and the piece of rib I got didn't really have any meat on it.\nThey also brought rice, beans, some other sauce, and a small dish of fried banana's. I didn't try the beans or whatever the sauce was but I did try the rice. It was plain, nothing exciting, plus it was slightly undercooked; I got a few crunchy pieces. The fried banana's were really good though.\n\nWe had the flan for dessert, it was actually really good. Keep in mind though, flan is pretty easy to make, but it was tasty.\n\nI think that it's a great concept and would be an enjoyable experience if the quality was better. While I'm glad we at least tried it, because it's always good to try something new, I doubt we'll ever be back. The price we paid wasn't worth it. Unless they lowered their price to $20 a person, I probably wouldn't come back. I think it would be a better idea to take your money to one of your favorite steakhouses.\n\nNow I was going to give this restaurant a 2, maybe 3, star rating however, after reading other reviews and seeing how the manager of Brazilian Bull responded to negative reviews I changed it to a 1 star rating. \nTip to the manager: if you want people to return after a bad experience, being rude, disrespectful and extremely defensive is not the way to do it. Being argumentative and trying to prove a point won't help your restaurant and you should keep in mind \""word of mouth\"" is a powerful tool. Learn some customer service and common courtesy."
"400 reviews, baby!!!\n\nthe MGM grand garden arena is definitely worth my 400th review...or maybe just the reason i was there made it more worthwhile.  i'm not really a big fan of vegas, cuz uhhhh...most of the time, vegas hates me and vice versa.  i give and give and give...and all vegas does is take and take and take.  it's a very unhealthy relationship for me.  so i usually try to avoid vegas at all costs, especially during holiday weekends.  but this trip was an exception...\n\ni was lucky enough to score some tickets to the big ufc fight through a photographer that i recently worked with.  i just love my job. :)  he definitely hooked me up!  i got to have my first experience at the garden arena and watch my first ufc fight...actually, my first real fight...period.  i don't even really know much about ufc or fighting but why in the world would i pass up this opportunity?  it would be totally unacceptable.  \n\nthe arena is located pretty deep in the MGM...i think...or we just went the wrong way and walked all the way around.  and of course, silly me was wearing heels.  i just don't ever learn.  hey, a girl has a right to wear cute shoes whenever she wants!  parking wasn't too bad considering the big event but we did get there pretty early to try to catch the first fight.  \n\ni don't think there are really any bad seats in the house.  the octagon is in the middle and there are big screens everywhere to get a better view of what's going on in there.  of course, there are bars all over the place so alcohol wouldn't be a problem.  this is vegas, damn it!  i didn't visit the bar tho.  i think that was the first time i actually stayed sober in vegas.\n\nall in all it was good times.  the venue was great for my first real right...and quite possibly, my last."
"First off I have only been inside this place once and the look of it kind of takes you by surprise.  The bar inside is a bit cramped but there are standing tables and a pool table with room to shoot. \n\nI personally have their food delivered because of one reason: their customer service.  In an age where social media (i.e Yelp!) can make or break your word-of-mouth, Tonic nailed it on the first try. \n\nI ordered delivery from them on their first week delivery being available and I ordered the Nicki Stixx and the Dee Snider pizza and they were awesome.  They also deliver booze too so I got a six pack of San Tan Devil's Ale.  \n\nThe kicker was this: they found my apartment with no hassle, they were fast and they brought me free ice cream as a way of saying thank you.  The delivery guy got an extra large tip and my continued business.  Well done Tonic."
"Stopped in for a few appetizers and had a nice time.  Bartender was very friendly and recommended the pigs in a blanket and wings.  Both were great!  Go for wings over pigs, if needed.  Nice portions for each.  Wings are done French style so they are soooo easy to eat.  I want all my wings like this for the future."
"When did libraries get so hi-tech? I don't even need to go to the librarian/assistants to get my books checked any more? I just put them on this little ledge and it lets me know when I need to bring it back? That is AWESOME.\n\nI popped in for a few quick read books as sometimes I don't want to spend a week or so one the one story and need something quick. The librarian was more than happy to give me a guided tour of how the library worked. With the way she was talking, the technology they are using now has been going for the last 3 or 4 years so I did feel a little silly.\n\nModern and very well laid out and also has groups for children, teenagers and a book club for adults that runs twice a month (Group A and Group B, they aren't expecting you to read that quickly all the time)\n\nIdeal place to come and read the papers if you don't plan on spending what is the small fortune to read the news too! I fell in love with libraries when I was a child and with the way they are going now, I think I have fallen in love again although I'm still trying to work out how xbox's and Playstation's are educational..\n\nLovely library with lovely staff, proud to have this as my local library."
"After reading the reviews I called DC to see if they had anything Open for me to get my expedition windows tinted  today ( Just the front two windows) Joe mentioned that he was working on a car but he didn't have to finish it until tomorrow and if I come right away he will fit me in. Wow! Made it there in less than 10 minutes he pulled the vehicle out that he was working on And pulled mine in.  He called Me back in about an hour and a half after working on my car and it looks great. Customer service, dependability And quality of work Joe is your man.... Highly recommend."
"A completely avoidable 3 HOUR tarmac delay in a frozen cabin!  NEVER flying US airways again.\n\nMy connecting flight from PHX to OAK came to the gate with a known major technical issue in the cockpit which would prevent proper pre-flight checks.\n\nThey boarded us anyway rather than provide a different plane. As one of the first people on board I saw 3 maintenance staff already present on the aircraft.\n\nWe received no status and upon inquiry (after 45 minutes with no action), they \""claimed\"" it was the first officer's seat-belt that needed replacement.   Seat belts don't take 3 hours to replace, nor do they require 4 levels of maintenance staff.  They had us sit there in a plane cold enough to ship freshly packed meat for 3 freaking hours.\n\nBy the time we took off I had developed a 103 fever.  I should sue them on behalf of my company, as I'll probably be down for the rest of the week trying to recover.\n\nThey also violated FAA/DOT rules regarding provision of adequate food/hydration, and after something so egregious, they offered nothing in compensation."
"This rating does NOT reflect the fabulous selection at The Bean--that's amazing. I was irritated by the customer service. It STARTED well, with a lady greeting me as I came in the door and asking if I needed help finding anything. When I said no, the lady walked over to her associate, and the two proceeded to engage in an epic--riveting, I'm SURE--conversation that was still going on 10 minutes later, which is when I walked (unnoticed) out the door. The conversation transpired in the middle of a crowed aisle, which I, along with another patron, were having no small amount of difficulty navigating. The two were completely oblivious to the fact that we were trying to see (and move) PAST them. When the other patron met my eyes and shook her head in bewilderment, my suspicion that this is NOT normal behavior for business proprietors was confirmed. I didn't stick around any longer. I found what I needed at JoAnn's right around the corner."
"If you deal with sales associate Courtney, good luck!. Went to get a remote start for my truck and not only did I have to track someone down to come help me, no one knew anything about any of the products that were at the store or online. Secondly, I was told 3.5 hours for install on Saturday it took 8.0 hours to install and two days later the product does not work (Viper). Tried calling to ask for a manager and nobody can seem to find me a manager on duty and gave me attitude every time. Tried speaking to techs and they are either not around or off every time I call. Needless to say the customer service is terrible and don't bother trying to talk to anyone about any product or service because no one has knowledge of anything there."
"I'm impressed with this Pizza - Mozzeralla, Provolone blend, just enough provolone to make it enhanced - The Service was Excellent!  In the past I have been unimpressed with this place... Yesterday they were ON!!!"
"I must have a foggy college memory because this food simply is not as good as I thought it was when I went to Arizona State.  The fries were bland and tasteless, the shrimp was....I don't even know, and the fish is very much akin to what you would find between two buns and slathered in tartar sauce at a certain drive through with Golden Arches.\nAnd how do people think this is cheap?!  I ordered a kids meal, an adult meal, and an order of chicken tenders to the tune of $19.  That is not cheap!\nThe only joy I found in the bland food is the sauce.  It's apparently a specialty that is only available there.  The sauce is delish, but the sauce really should not be the only source of flavor in a meal, and that is the biggest problem here,"
Timmy is so skilled! I always know I will leave his chair looking my best.
Good enough job. Better than Danny's. They are relentless on the up sales though. I dropped a car off to have it detailed and the guy had the stones to call me 15 minutes later trying to up sale me.
"i stayed here last week while on business. The lobby was very elegant in a minimalist fashion. Since the hotel has opened recently and it was probably only 60% occupied they upgraded both myself and my associate to suites. \nThe suites were basically nice sized one bedroom apartments complete with washer and dryers and full kitchens. The place was impeccable. great workstation, bedroom and phenomenal living room so tastefully decorated. it didn't feel like a hotel room at all more like a very sophisticated friends apartment that you are staying at unbenownst to them. The amenities were also tip top from the completely modern and very friendly service oriented gym to the business center. \nThis is one of the non gaming hotels in City Center however you can be in the Bellagio or Aria within minutes of leaving Vdara. I will be back."
"Where to begin? As we planned our VEGAS trip for about two weeks, we were excited about our room at the MGM signature. I mean the pictures looks amazing from the bed to the bathroom. Needless to say that, My comment isn't negative on MGM'S part or the room but with luxury suites themselves. Our booking was wrong, two rooms with one at 24 floor and the other at 10th floor? How was that next to each other? So moving on we just decided to take the different floors and get over it. the main reason we wanted to book a room is 1)nice pictures and spacious 2) enjoy a good view with a smoke in hand. Since the site offered smoking we booked it. When we got there they told us that it was fine for us to smoke as long as we didn't dirty or burn anything  because the luxury suite is a 3rd party and they have their own cleaning services. Then we get a call saying we are getting charged $150 for a cleaning fee because there was smoke in the room. So my comment is watch our for 3rd party bookings and try to book with the actual hotel or casino themselves. We weren't aware of the 3rd party bull**** until we got there. I'm just hoping I can at least help someone from getting rip off like us.\n\n$89 a night for two nights +\nresort fee and etc for two rooms = $468 which isn't bad until we were charged $150 more\n\npros: the room was lovely, friendly service, close to monorail and attractions\n\ncons: the walk from MGM signature to the strip was horrible, ike about 15 mins walk to strip, LUXURYSUITEINTL.COM"
Another disappointing experience.  Why can they make good al pastor tacos. Don't even use real corn tortillas. The only good thing was the horchata.
"I really like the Springs Preserve.  This review would have been 5 stars if the Preserve still had the \""Untold Stories\"" series on the first Thursday of the month.  These programs about the history of Las Vegas were wonderful, but the Preserve decided to re-evaluate their educational offerings.\n\nI love the Origen Building with its movie \""Miracle in the Mojave\"" about water and the lack thereof in the Las Vegas Valley.  It's a brief film, narrated by Martin Sheen, and it quite nicely relates how the area came to be what it is geologically.\n\nThe flash flood in the Origen is also fun to see.  When it's not too hot, I like to go in the back and see the animals in the fenced area or in the display domes.\n\nI need to go back and hike the trails again to see what has changed from when they opened."
"Well, This review is based on the sushi alone --- so 1 star. If I was reviewing the bar - 5 stars!\n\nAnyway --- If you actually enjoy RA Sushi, I wonder if you're only eating Vegas Rolls and potsickers. I know your type: New to sushi, want to get drunk with your friends and pretend to actually enjoy raw fish. I know, I know...you're in college and it's Mill Ave. \n\nI am fine to get trashed here, I LOVE their bartenders and inventive drinks...but the food is nast. \n\nThat's RA in a nutshell."
We're parked the patio and its so lovely. Very hot but beautiful and service is amazing. The menu is diverse but solely cocktails. There a server parked at the door turning so many people away who are looking for food. \n\nI'm having the palomas and they're amazing. Definitely the best I've had but I'm looking at $15 a pop. Husband is having blue moon beer and they're at least only $7. \n\nIt's a lovely and quiet retreat an I wouldn't hesitate to return. To be honest I don't particularly wish to leave in the first place.
"Look... You know what you're getting into when you pull up to a Mexican food restaurant with a yellow ,green, and red sign. For the most part it is what it is, but I think this Frederico's sets the bar pretty high for one of these.  I've eaten there many times, as I work down the street. Everything I've ever had has been good, if not very good-case in point, the Pollo Asado burrito- its killer. They even have a ground beef special burrito or tacos with a drink for cheap. It's really good for a \""Monday after\"" lunch.\nMost importantly, it's never wrecked me, it is clean inside if you want to dine in, and it doesn't smell like pine sol.    \n\nFour Stars is Fair for Frederico's!"
"The hotel is a little expensive for what you get, I guess it's the location. The marketing staff need to learn better ways to speak to guests, I would NEVER tell a guest in MY hotel the way the hotel runs behind the scenes as far as who gets things comped for them and who isn't worth it! Food is as expected mediocre taste and over priced! I lost over $9000 there not to be a sore looser, but do you think I'm \""worth\"" giving a room to? Will stay there again just because of location, but reluctant to how the \"" hotel and casino\"" are run. You also show a nice clean bathroom in the pictures but you don't show the mold in the bathrooms."
"Ham samich.  They don't get much better than this.  I highly recommend trying one if you haven't.\n\nI quite enjoyed my Tavern sandwich.  Ham, bacon, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and a delicious honey mustard sauce were perfectly crafted between two slices of whole wheat bread.  I'd have to say this is one of the best deli style places I've been too, but keep in mind that I am not really a deli sandwich connoisseur.  I got the ham salad as a side, and I would have to say it was the right choice.  It was down right delicious.  Just do yourself a favor, and get this stuff with your sandwich.  Better yet, they have a ham salad sandwich (that I can't wait to try).\n\nThe service was friendly too.  The manager gave us four catering packages to give out to our business associates.  I am really hoping that my work orders some catering service from Honeybaked Ham.  They just kill that other deli that we have been ordering from for our staff meetings!"
"When we first walked in we were surprised to find that it is a pick your pizza up and go home kind of shop. It was our first time so we asked Felipe, the employee up front, a few questions. He was short and not very friendly with his responses. We decided on our favorite, pepperoni and pineapple, on their double crust. Felipe described it similar to Dominos. I should have walked out the door then because I don't like Dominos pizza. The menu says double crust is a little thicker than the thin crust. We found a coupon online for a free pasta so we added a spaghetti to the order. We paid and he said it would be ready in 20-25 minutes.  As I was sitting in the lobby, I could see a small tv on a table in the back kitchen area. An employee walked over and turned the tv, made me question how sanitary it was back there. After tasting our pizza, I would compare it to a frozen pizza from the grocery. I was so disappointed. I really did not like their sauce. It was thick, clumped in various places of the pizza and weird tasting. The crust was dense and flavorless. The cheese was fine but they could have been more generous with the toppings. My husband hasn't tried the spaghetti yet, but I won't be trying it as I'm sure the sauce is the same as the pizza sauce. I won't go back there. If I want mediocre pizza, I can go to Little caesars for 1/3 of the price."
I think this may be the best place on the strip for blackjack. My nephew mentioned this place as being the best and I  agree.   It has the most $5 Blackjack tables of any place I've found on the strip.  They are far and few between.  My three sisters went in together playing one Wheel of Fortune slot machine and managed to pull out $500 off of  one machine the first day we were there.   I probably sunk at least half of that though..so I wasn't so lucky.  Breakfast was good  at their Victorian Cafe. If you go early enough (before 8 am) they have some sort of steak and eggs special for $6.00 or $7.00.  Coffee is not that good though.
"Tao is off the hook!  Bex hooked it up as always.  Great music, great staff, atmosphere was great.  If you guys make it out to Vegas, go to Tao..you \nwon't regret it!  Holla at my girl BEx and she will hook it up with a great deal.  Bex once again, you did it..thanks for always hooking it up!  Until next time!!"
"Let me start with the good.  Their fish seemed fresh, and they have some interesting, well conceived rolls.  Their Scallop Nigiri was fantastic, fresh, and delicious.\n\nOutside of the scallops, their food was 'Meh'.  Had Yakisoba, and several rolls; did not try any of their sashimi, because it seemed really expensive (4 pc. Sake Sashimi for $9).  We quickly realized why the rolls were cheaper: because there isn't much fish in them.  The fish on the rainbow roll we got  was sliced so thin, it was hard to tell how quality the fish was.  The rice to fish ratio was ridiculous, leaving with me mostly full, but unsatisfied.\n\nWe were warned before ordering that they were pretty busy, and we should put our sushi order in quickly.  While I appreciate the warning, I don't think AN HOUR AND A HALF is an acceptable waiting time with or without warning.  The Yakisoba we ordered came out promptly, but after finishing it, we waited another full hour for the sushi.\n\nOverall I feel they are overpriced for what you get, and the food is not exactly worth the wait.  Not bad by any means, but not worth dealing with the price/service."
"Pretty decent condo-style resort / timeshare to spend your week.  I had a spacious 1,000 sqft 1 bedroom unit with an in-unit laundry facility, which was very convenient.   Everything was very clean and there was plenty of bath towels.   Only 2 negatives: a)  $50 per week fee for internet access which wasn't even that fast, only 300-500 kb/s, not suitable for streaming videos, just good for emailing and light surfing, AND b) units around the pool area will be able to hear a low generator humming noise at night. Unfortunately, my unit was next to the pool area, so I slept with earplugs on.  Lastly, annoying kids with squeaky high pitched voices seem to wake up early in the morning and frolic in the pool, so I couldn't sleep in no later than 8 am.   Also, you'll need a car if you want to get around from here.  It's about 25 minutes to the strip, but there was plenty of stores and eateries within 5 minutes.\n\nWould I stay here again? Only if I don't get a unit near the pool area and internet connectivity was faster, preferably 1 mbs+."
"Sorry 2 stars, that's it from me. One go to the guy who makes omelet and pasta, the other star go to convenient that gives after long day at pool. \nI ask for a cup of coffee to waitress lady and she forget to bring it to me, WTH. With the price that they charged is not cheap and the varieties they provide was just an average. This is our second time here and will not go back again. \nHope Mandalay Bay Hotel decide to change to different buffet..."
"Went on a thursday night with my boyfriend, it wasn't busy but took 10min. to be seated then ordered and it took a while for the waitress to return with just our drinks. Our food came nice and hot but then our waitress didn't return to ask if we needed something, service was bad and the food was just okay.We won't be returning to this location."
"Monday I had a low tire warning in my car. Called the jag dealership, they wanted to order a new tire without looking at the car. They do not fix flats. I went to this business and expected the same. I made an appointment. The place was packed. I was offered water. My car was looked at, I was told it would take 40 minutes(I expected longer). In 25 min the tech came out, said the repair was done and they were pulling the car up to the front door, and there was no charge. Everyone was friendly , professional,on time with my appointment, and it was free!!!  I would recommend this tire place to everyone. I brought a book because I thought I would be spending the day there. What a pleasant surprise."
"This Borders closes very early compared to other stores and is always low on stock.  You can never find anybody to help you find something, but the line is short and the clearance section is nice.  The bathrooms are so-so.  The music selection is great and so are the DVDs."
"Called my insurance company to have my dodge magnum rt towed to my mechanic shop for repairs. First the company said they'd be here at 10:30 showed up an hour later. I requested to have a flat bed tow my car , as I have front side impact damage. Tow truck driver shows up , in a normal tow truck. I call walker company speak to Tim who was extremely rude. He told me he would not provide me with a flatbed and told me to find another tow company. The tow truck driver was nice .. And said himself , if a customer wants a flatbed , then they should get a flatbed. Tim is extremely rude very unprofessional and probably shouldn't be in customer service."
"We wanted to stop somewhere close to the freeway to eat as we were about to leave Las Vegas on our way home to Los Angeles, We decided to head to the Palms assuming that they would have a good buffet to eat at. We discovered the Bistro Buffet, and decided to give it a try. \n\nThe restaurant has a very nice look to it. It is modern in appearance, and has an upscale cafeteria feel about it. It is one of the smallest buffets that I have been to in Las Vegas, but getting seated was not an issue. \n\nThe food was not very good. Most of it was cold, and tasted as though it had been sitting around for hours. Condiments were very hard to find, and the whole setup in general seemed disorganized. The one highlight from the food selection was the crab legs. They were fairly big and pre-cut to make them easier to peel open and eat. \n\nThe other highlight of eating here was that the service was excellent. Our waiter kept our cups filled and cleared our dishes whenever we finished a plate. He was very accommodating and was able to help us with whatever we needed. The service made up a little bit for the food being sub par. \n\nOverall, the Bistro Buffet was a disappointment. The food just wasn't good. With so many other options in Vegas, I can't see any reason for me to eat here again."
"What a waste of money.  I got home and cleaned off all the missed spots and glass that wasn't cleaned.  Not to mention when I was there I was hassled to upgrade to everything, even fixing my windshield. WTF"
"Good stuff.  Unusual, for me anyway, but always enjoy trying something different.\nI've never ordered anything from here but what they have on the shelves has been tasty and fresh.\nWe've had breakfast or lunch her on a few occasions and that's good.  Nothing fancy though.\nOne thing about this place is it's very small.  Like maybe two tables that seat four and maybe a two top too."
"Val was very helpful and knowledgeable about the products. She helped me with a sim card issue and didn't even charge me, so I bought a stock charger for a great price. Will buy from again and refer my friends and family."
Incredible!  Very friendly service and wonderful food.  My husband and I tried the brown stew chicken and the oxtail.  Both excellent!  Prices were very inexpensive for the quality and quantity of food.  A must try!
Bad service altogether
"What a fabulous venue for yet another fabulous yelp event. From the valet to the restrooms. From the vast modern space to impressive and friendly service. \nAnd the food! Oy Ve (that's Japanese for yummy)...\nIka Furai\nAge Watari Gani\nAbura Bouzo No Tataki Shiro Asparagus Zoe\nButaniku To Hotate No Gyoza\nYakitori-Negima Yaki\n\nOK. Admit it. You know asparagus. But what about the rest? Well, you'll have to check out Roka Akor to find out. Cuz I'm not spilling it. My fave was the Abura Bouzo. Buttah! Like a big stick of buttah! I could have chowed down several more. And then several more. Light and airy with clean lines and muted tones, this is contemporary asian at its best. \n\nOrigato. Dori Ori Gato Mr. Roboto."
"If you want bland, boring, tasteless food, head over to the Chino BLANDido, where you can feast on \""Chinese\"" BBQ Pork and jerk fried rice that is as exciting as watching paint dry. All things considered I'd rather eat paint. No doubt it would have more flavor..."
"Absolutely THE worst!  This place won \""Best of Madison\"" for Chinese food for how many years??? The judge must have been completely stoned out of his mind! \nCustomer service:  Very poor.  The server never checked back until I went looking for her, wondering where our order was 50 minutes after ordering. \nFood finally arrived for our group of four--STONE COLD!  Plates themselves were hot but practically frostbite on the food.  Couldn't eat it. \nManager came by, apologized and took 50% off the bill (!!!). Should have been 100% comped. \nI'm one of those folks who normally overlooks a lot and actually hates to complain, but this culinary travesty really needed to be reported.  If this place previously had great food and service, then as of 2014 they've completely lost their \""mojo\""."
"This place gets pretty crowded, but I wouldn't recommend coming here. It's good for something fast and convenient (since I was staying at the Venetian). The prices are pretty ridiculous for Chinese food. I mean 15-20 bucks per dish. I mean I guess it is Vegas & everything is expensive. \n\nWe shared the Shanghai rice cakes, Singapore noodles, and chicken fried rice. Bland, bland and bland. I mean it was edible, but Chinese food is suppose to be BURSTING with flavor! \n\nI would suggest if you want some good Chinese food to leave the strip and go to Spring Mountain Road and you'll find TONS of Chinese/Vietnamese restaurants that are so much better and CHEAPER!"
This is the best Kabob place I've found on the East Side. We usually do take out and the meat is cooked and seasoned perfectly and the rice is delicious. Very gracious staff as well. I usually order the beef kabob and I love it.
"We live walking distance and frequent the store. We have purchased all sorts of groceries and steaks and have always been delighted by the superior quality of food. As far as their coffee can't go wrong, when it's $.75 for a refill.  Definitely love this place!"
"Expensive (more than dealership), not fast, and they REALLY do some up-selling."
service was great
"WOW! I can't believe I've never had frozen custard before, it's freakin' good!\n\nNielsen's was our last stop in Vegas before heading back to CA. I was determined to try it even though it was 8:30pm & we had a 5 hour drive ahead of us. I mean, doesn't having a yummy snack make long drives better?\n\nThe workers here are SOOO incredibly nice, practically forcing us to have free samples before we chose to buy anything. They always have 3 flavors fresh in stock & a bunch of rock hard frozen flavors in the freezer. \n\nWe had a scoop of vanilla custard ($2.22) & a chocolate concrete w/ Kit Kat mixed in ($4.90). Between the 3 of us, we couldn't even finish because the custard was so creamy & thick & the servings were so large. The ever-so-friendly workers even gave us a little extra custard in our concrete so that it was oozing over the edge.\n\nI can only describe it as a creamier version of ice cream w/o all the extra ice fluff & a thicker version of frozen yogurt. Whatever this magical mixture is, it's heavenly!\n\nFrozen custard was even voted as on of the \""top 100 things to eat.\"" You'd be a fool not to try it!"
"I brought my elderly father in to the Tenaya Way location because he is very ill. His physician sent us over with STAT orders for a chest xray. He was recently released from the hospital after a month and his health is touchy. We checked in and they saw STAT in the orders and said they don't \""do\"" that.  His dr. Needed these ASAP but these people couldn't care less. \nI know why I use Desert Radiology. I should have taken him there (but insurance dictates where you go.)"
"Ok, so I just tried this place after reading all the good reviews.\n\nLike someone mentioned before, the Lovely Bit O Salmon is awesome.  Of course I didn't get that, but my coworker did and it made me jealous!  I got the Spicy Asiago Chicken and although it was really good, it was nothing like the taste I had of the salmon pasty.  I will have to get that salmony creamy goodness next time. \n\nThese things will fill you up.  I felt like I needed a nap after my pasty lunch!"
"Words cannot even express how much I hate this place. It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here. I've been here four times. FOUR CHANCES, and they blew every single one.\n\nVisit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends. Order a margarita. Worst margarita of my life, hands down. My friend also ordered one and hated it. We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back. It was that bad). We told our server that we'd like something different, but we needed a moment to decide. She rolled her eyes, took them away, and we didn't see her until much later, when she delivered our bill. I had no drinks that night.\n\nVisit #2: I went with my husband for lunch. Ordered the crab sandwich. I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it, it was so disgusting. Now, I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week. My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par. Getting meals you don't like is a part of life. This, however, was inedible. For the second time ever (I never send food back, I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad), I had to send it back and ask for something different. Our server seemed really perturbed, but did bring me the meal I ordered instead. It was mediocre at best, but I ate it without any complaint. I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal, even though I didn't, in hopes of her mood improving. It didn't.\n\nVisit #3: Don't even ask me why, but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us. Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time, though), but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way. Dirty looks, only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there, didn't say hello or smile once. We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day, but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case. To be clear, we did not complain about anything at any time. We were kind, polite, and didn't keep her from other tables. What the hell?\n\nVisit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run. I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors. First off, we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree). Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again, outside of the place, by the sidewalk). A man promptly and rudely said, \""I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there.\"" Okay. So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him. When we got back and found a seat, I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us. Upon asking us what we wanted to drink, I said, \""There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar...\"" \""We don't.\"" He said, and just looked at us. That's it. I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer). \""No, I told you we don't.\"" Finally after awkwardly floundering about, my friend and I settled on another drink. We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball). But seriously, dealing with TWO rude men tonight, plus the history I've had there, makes me realize I really will never go back ever. And I mean it this time.\n\nI mean truly, I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me. I smile big, say hello, don't take too much of their time, don't whine or complain, etc. But the fact that four of my all time worst restaurant experiences were all from Casey Moore's is just too much to ignore. I hate that place and hate that I'm the only one who feels this way."
"Not a bad little place at all. I can only add one more little tip, Yelpers. If you have a Mac you're going to have a problem getting onto the network. \nMy friend Jack and the lady sitting across from us had the same problem, they couldn't connect.\n\nShould have bought a PC fools!"
"A friend suggested that we play golf at Starfire, little (short) resort style course on Hayden in Scottsdale.\nI don't want to get off on a rant here, but will someone (other than me...I did tell them but the blank stares I encountered lead me to believe that my diatribe was ineffective and possibly not even understood by the staff at Starfire) tell them to give the Armor All a rest!\nI suppose the course is nice enough...I've played there many times since I moved to town.\nI suppose the prices are reasonable...I have certainly paid more to play a course in worse condition.\nSo why the one star for a place called Starfire? Somebody needs to tell the morons in the cart barn or out in the staging area to give the Armor All a rest!!!!!\nI appreciate a pretty, shiny golf cart as much as the rest of hacking community...but don't spray it all over the cart...and don't spray it so it drips places where I will put my hands!!!!\nOnce the still wet Armor All gets on your hands, you are done golfing until you:\nA - get some solvent to get this crap out of all the little ridges and cracks in my hands...not good...it took 2 days, and;\nB - Get a good golf shop to re-grip ALL of your golf clubs to the tune of approx. $100\nYou cannot play golf if you can't hang onto the club and with Armor All on your hands, you literally (and I don't mean figuratively...I literally mean literally) cannot hold onto a golf club and swing it...it just won't be happening. I quit after 3 holes.\nNo satisfaction when I asked for a refund or some sort recompense (they did offer me a cart which wasn't dripping with Armor All, but the damage was done by then).\nI doubt I'll spend my golfing dollars there again."
hate the service. please fix
"I visited Cesar Chavez Park early in 2011 for a company picnic. We had our picnic on the south side of the park. I walked around the lake and took some photos of the park. As long as the weather is cool, I would recommend this park. If you love the heat, then you can visit the park at  any time of the year.  There is fishing at the lake inside the park. I will upload some photos to give a better idea of what the park has to offer."
Food was marginal. I had a chicken taco plate and burrito that was flavorful and could have been worth the very long wait if their wasn't better available nearby. Nothing special here folks. Glad we didnt move to Ahwatukee for the food.
uncle sals is nothing special. in fact it's unspecial as in retarded in their customer service. the food is average but service is horrible. we have eaten there twice take out too actually. this evening. my girlfriend picked up the food and was told by the cashier that the salmon bruschetta would not be available so the kitchen left out the salmon and mamagement subtracted one dollar off the bill. complained right then and there.\nNothing was offered. This is the 2nd time our order was prepared with errors and not the tasty food we were anticipating.  My girlfriends seven year old daughter with the rest of her school mates could do a better job of preparing a take out meal.  When my girlfriend called Sal's again to complain the man identifying himself as the manager hung up on her.  \ni just read previous reviews where there is a cockroach infestion?
Great sports bar! Really friendly service and clientele. The quesadillas are slammin!
This bridal boutique was great!!! Our bridal consultant Jessica  was so sweet and helpful.  Their dress selection was amazing and the prices were reasonable. I highly recommend finding your dream dress here.
"Beautiful resort away from the crazy strip.\n The pool is really nice, cool poolside bar with built in ice strip to keep your drink cold. I've been to the pool for a few events, and it never feels crowded, there's lots of room, never had a bad time.\n I've eaten the buffet here and its pretty tasty, nice variety, free wine (NICE!). Hash House A Go Go is okay, big portions is their thing, its a chain so the food is average. Babycakes has gelato and pastries and specialty coffees, don't miss the gelato (good stuff).\nI haven't really gambled here, but I'm sure I will one of these days. I know their free gifts when you have a players card are much better than some of the junk other resorts give away.\nI also have never seen their rooms, so I can't comment on them."
"The journey to Buzzberry started off crappily.  I was on my way to work and couldn't turn left at Hayden and Indian Bend due to construction forcing me to drive south (further away from my projected destination) and towards Mcdonald.  I was already running late to work so I didnt have time to eat or drink anything when i passed by Buzzberry and said to myself, damn yo imtired slash hungry what's this all about.  The building is inviting and with an attached drive thru appealing to someone in a hurry/on the go.  The coffee was great and actually gave me some energy, the breakfast burrito was great as well, flavorful and fresh!  Try it out you won't be disappointed, support the little guys F Starbucks, for serious."
"This is a tough review to write. On the one hand their cook is incredible! He's nice, remembers your order, and makes one of the best Breakfast Burritos in town! I would highly recommend getting the Bacon one and adding jalepenos. \n\nAlso, if you go there for lunch and get one of their specials, it is very generica cafeteria food. Of the items served on their specials, typically one is pretty good, one is really bad (to the point you can't eat it), and one is mediocre. \n\nWhile the food passes the test for cheap quick food, what kills this place in the ratings is the cashier's ability to be unfriendly, almost all of the time. If you go there just once or twice, you wouldn't even notice it. But, if you go there most days of the week for breakfast, it starts to ruin the great breakfast burrito.\n\nI'll still eat here, but if anyone recommends anywhere else, count me in!"
"Great, non-corporate bowling alley. Good lanes, cheap beer, decent eats at the Oaxaca restaurant. Very reasonable prices. Cosmic bowling on the weekend, happy hour (with buck and a half PBR's) during the week. A Sunnyslope landmark, long may it roll!"
"Before Spicy Tuna, I was not a fan of sushi. It was okay, but nothing I craved. Now, I wake up craving the Grand Canyon - the mother of all sushi rolls. It's like amazing in your mouth. \nIf you can, request Jake as your server. He knows all of the millions of rolls available and is an expert waiter. \nIf you can dream it, it's on the menu. The only hard part is making a decision!"
"Seems a litle overpriced for chicken, fresh or not.  I think if you skip the value meals and just get singles pieces of chicken, it may be a little more worth it.  This place doesn't hold a candle to Buffalo Wild Wings.  BW3's has more sauces, more selection and better prices.  I'd say hang on to your $$ and go get a snickers bar."
"Not that great, very busy and it seemed every store I entered was out of what I was looking for.  Parking is horrible as well.  I don't plan on ever going back to this place.  I gave it two stars instead of one since the misters are nice in the summer."
"Dinner buffet price is up to like $37/person now and wait on a Friday night at 5PM was non existent.  \n\nOur waitress was A-mazing!!!  My brother liked the tea so much that he asked what it was.  Not did she just tell him what it was but she went out of her way to find and write down the distributor name, website, and product flavor name (it was actually a papaya tea by China Mist).  She also noted that they were just testing out the tea and may or may not continue to serve it in the future but the response from customers has been highly positive.\n\nSome new favorite foods this time around to add to the must get list when you come to the Wynn Buffet:\n1) Chilean seabass (they didn't have this the first time I came here and I'm a big fish lover so you usually don't see this kind of fish served often)\n2) Spicy tuna hand rolls\n3) Some kind of buffalo salad\n4) Mushrooms (marinated in a delicious sauce)\n5) Key lime pie (I didn't like it before, now I do)"
"Northwest Yoga is the best studio I have been to.  The atmosphere is warm, the energy is sweet and the variety of classes and instructors allow many choices.  The owner has really expanded the studio, the offerings and the schedule, and has set a beautiful tone.  I especially enjoy Karen and Patrice as instructors.  I have learned so much, made many friends and feel better than I have in years.  This studio is my home and where my heart is."
"The good is that they were able to do the job I needed done, right away. I took in my son's new scout shirts and needed about 12 little patches sewn on for that evening's meeting. They were able to do it, and I was glad to pay the $20 to get it done quickly which gave me a little bit more of my life back. The only bad was that a couple of the award patches were not put on exactly as I had showed the lady, but heck, I don't think she'd ever seen a cub scout shirt before and I didn't pin those last pieces where they were suppsoed to go so she had to go by her memory of where I showed her they went. I will use them again when I gather enough awards to be sewn on to the shirt again, and at that point, I'll just nicely ask her if she can move those couple items over where they belong. No big deal."
"Two stars.  One for price (less than 80 on a weekend) and location (heart of the strip).  Okay after that... -3 stars for elevators.  I mean really!! Sunday, check out day, 13th floor.  The elevator going down is packed every time. After 5 minutes of watching this, we saw patrons take their wheelie suitcases and walk down the 13 floors of stairs!!! We had to jump on a car going up, that was half full. And it hit EVERY FLOOR on the way down to a room full of groans after the car was full. On the 7th floor some lady half cried as she threw herself into the car, wedging between suitcases. It was lord of the flies in there.\n\nSo if your cheap, get on the 2nd floor and walk down a flight, otherwise good lord help you.  Check out at 6 am."
"As all of you guys who read this may know that there are tons of Starbucks to choose from, this is unfortunately not the one I would go back in the morning rush hour time. I am sure the majority of the cafe in the morning makes you wait, but I thought this was one of the place that took forever to even take your order.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere and  store interior is clean and moderate volume. Once you order what you want, it will not take too long to get your product. Only thing that irritate me is the line that took forever to order the coffee."
"I do not understand why a restaurant would go to the trouble of wet and dry aging a steak to serve it smothered in a sauce?\n\nOur appetizer, bruchetta was ok, nothing great.  The wedge salad was very good, excellent blue cheese dressing.\n\nWe ordered the 4 Cheese Mac and Cheese and Broccoli au Gratin.  The Mac and Cheese was pretty good but not outstanding.  The Broccoli au Gratin was just broccoli with a cheese sauce,  we expected a baked broccoli and cheese dish.\n\nThe steaks were not good at all.  The first steaks they brought out were barely warm, I was very disappointed to see they both had been smothered in a brown gravy like sauce.   The waiter took them back to reheat them and when he brought them back they were basically the same.  He took those back and brought two new ones out about 10 minutes later, these were hotter but still not what I would expect for a 35-50 dollar steak.  If I had known the steaks were sauced/gravied here I would have never eaten here.  This should be disclosed on the menu."
I have nothing compelling to say because this restaurant is unremarkable.  The food is good.  I have eaten here a few times when I was with a group.  I wouldn't ever choose it on my own accord.
"Everything was excellent. Started with the Buffalo Blast appetizer! Amazing! The pizza and soup,were both good and of course the cheesecake was outstanding. The service was excellent and we waited less than 5 minutes to get in. The only problem I had with it (as seems to be the case with many restaurants in Vegas) is actually finding it."
"by far the BEST chocolate ganache and red velvet cupcake i've ever had!  The cupcakes were moist and the icing wasn't tooooo sweet, a perfect combination.  The decoration is ultra cute... this place may be the only reason i would stay at the Palazzo again lol"
Worst service I've ever had in my life! Horrible and unprofessional. Don't bother here!!
"Really delicious! I've been looking for some Indian food for awhile and decided to try this place out. Definitely going to have to become a regular. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was the best I've had. as well as the naan, which was also excellent! A must go for sure!"
"Cannot recommend before safety standards are improved. \n\nPros: courteous, professional shuttle drivers who are punctual; office was helpful in rescheduling due to my delayed flight\n\nCons: Loose safety procedures. My single seat buggy lacked left foot rest, four point belt was checked only after I asked. Was not told which group to follow, turned out I was w the guide and two company mechanics, yet I was constantly left in the dust due to my groups familiarity and my sub standard buggy w reduced power. Trying hard to keep up, my buggy gave up half way up a slope the others cleared. I was told that some buggies were beat up so didn't perform well. Not one buggy had a raised flag; this combined w a group that weaved in and out, I lost the group often in the dunes. We were told to follow the guides path bc wavering just 10 ft could result in serious injury: on two occasions I lost the group and hit violent falls. Finally, when it's time to park, one of the staffs buggy rear ends mine, causing a not insignificant whiplash. All I heard was another staff jeer \""what the f r u doing?\"" followed by more banter among the staff. No apologies, as if rude behavior explained the \""it's all in good fun\"" attitude towards this potentially dangerous sport. \n\nI've done experience events w skip barber and Infineon raceway; all very professionally run and ran strict safety procedures. Sun Buggy feels run by frat brothers who believe the periodical \""r u having fun dude\"" is equal to safe and fun."
"Fresh, juicy, and flavorful.  Be sure to get the double double to enjoy the full flavor of the meat and cheese.  Truly fresh veggies and I really like the sauce that resembles a homemade thousand island dressing.  The fries are standard issue julienned fries but are hot out of the fryer, crispy and just right salted.  This location was busy but not impossible to get a seat.  Everything seemed clean in spite of the crowd."
Good stuff! Much needed on a hot day!
"Twice I've caught Espresso Royale staff overcharging me for my drinks. Mind this if you are ordering a tea latte, because somehow they charge you for a coffee latte instead, which is way more expensive.\n\nIn addition, I caught food poisoning from their mango smoothie."
"Finally made it to Matt's for breakfast.  I had to check out the hype and see if it is what everyone says it is!  I took my nieces with me and I wasn't sure if it was very kid friendly...let's say I wouldn't bring young ones there just because it is so small and there is no room to run around.  But since my gals are 10 and 11 there was no problem accommodating them.  They split the delicious belgian waffle.  Let me tell you this is the tastiest I have ever tried!!  Real maple syrup is the key and they serve the best.  All piping hot and fresh off the griddle (my mouth waters just thinking of it).  I ordered the egg sandwich with no bacon, so it was a fried egg with american cheese and sauteed onions.  Not the healthiest option but I really enjoyed it.  I am not sure what kind of bread it was on but it was soft and fantastic.  The fresh squeezed OJ is like eating a ripe orange and the coffee was very well made.  All in all I can see why people are willing to wait for a long time to eat here."
"This is the worst service EVER! It's Saturday and I walked in as the 3rd person to be helped and I've been here over a hour. The salesman has been talking with 1 customer for over 45min and they just left and didn't buy anything he just gave them info, horrible salesman and then he left for break when there are now 10 people waiting. The employees have no sense of urgency and don't know what they're talking about.  I have a business account but changed my personal account to Verizon, thank god.  As soon as my last contract is up I will be done with them.  Beware of Sprint, worst customer service in the industry."
"OH XS, why must you be so amazing!?\n\nRight off the bat, the vibe is upbeat and people are lookin' good! You walk through the doors, up the stairs, and as soon as you you turn that corner, BAM! A vision like no other! It's breath taking and when I show my friends this club for the first time, I love the look on their faces when they see this view! You can either go straight to the dance floor or go either right or left to outside or a bar..  \n\nPoles are scattered along the club for dancing and to top it off they have two platforms with poles. I am not going to say that I am in favor of those poles, but only in favor to see some females display the level of intoxication!! Hey, it's Vegas, what do you expect!?\n\nFeel like gambling!? Don't worry, XS has it covered! Walk along the patio seating and along the pool where you will find another bar and a \""Party Pit' if you will.... One craps table and a couple blackjack tables as well! Of course, while actively gaming, your drinks are on the house!!\n\nI celebrated my birthday here last year and got the best service! Huge table and they even brought me a birthday cake! What girl doesn't like firework-like candles on her birthday cake!? My girlfriends and I danced the night away and what was great was that there was security always watching us. In Vegas, there are always groups of girls that go to clubs and it was nice to have a big buff guy there to keep an eye out!\n\nMusic is loud and everywhere you look, people are having a great time! Staff is easy on the eyes and move as quickly as they can! The staff keeps this place clean as it is the most beautiful club in Vegas. I expect nothing less from a club located in a 5 star 5 diamond resort.\n\nDebating on going? Don't! You will have a blast! I believe the doors open at 10. If I were you, get on a guest list. The line gets pretty long!"
"Sat at the bar.  Very friendly, even charged my phone for me.  Beer good.  Flat bread and bruschetta great post hockey game fare.  Convivial, good service, good food, good drinks."
"Wow, what a great Mexican place! The most amazing collection of sauces I've ever seen. Their homemade sauce was enough though, the food is very tasty, and the price is certainly right. Fish tacos FTW!"
"Posh. Wow Josh, you've got a gem here in Scottsdale. Talk about innovative and improvisational. \n\nOn the slow nights, Josh (the owner) will be patrolling the dining room or tending the bar. It's nice to see the chef/owner making an appearance on the floor and interacting with the customers.\n\nHere's the deal. As your server hands you a menu, you begin to check off general things such as temperature you'd like your meat cooked, allergies, and anything that you don't like. Then you choose how many courses you'd like, and the optional wine pairing. The rest is up to the kitchen. Whatever is in season, whatever sounds innovative, it's all up to the discretion of Josh and his staff as to what you will be eating that night.\n\nOne of the best things was when my fianc\u00e9 and I went, we each got a different plate for each course. We had the 5 course meal, but tried each others so we ended up trying 10 different plates. How cool!\n\nSitting at the chef counter and watching the kitchen prepare your dish is one of our favorite things to do, which is why we elected to sit at the bar where we could watch our meal be created. It was also nice to run into local restaurateur/chef James Porter and his wife Wendy (Petite Maison, Big Earl's BBQ). \n\nThe kitchen staff is keen on presentation and meticulously preparing each plate, and it stands out. The food was cooked perfectly, looked incredible, and tasted amazing. We got to try some interesting dishes, along with some staples. I had a soft shell crab with a chipotle aioli and butter lettuce that was to do die for.  The alligator was great. And I think the most intriguing dish we had was monkfish liver. It was savory, but not too fish-y. Loved it.\n\nThanks to Josh for sending a couple extra tastes to the bar. Taylor and I enjoyed every bite. It was nearly too much food for us!\n\nPosh also has a great bar menu with twists on some classic cocktails along with an extensive wine list. Be sure to check out their Late Night specials that start at 10pm on Wednesdays, it's a less expensive way to experience Posh.\n\nNot an everyday restaurant, but definitely worth the splurge every once in a while for a special occasion."
"My most recent visit here was quickly headed into the 2-3 star category, but thankfully turned into a positive one.  The restaurant was only half full, and granted we had a party of 12 show up at 7pm on a Monday night, they told us it would be 45-50 minutes of waiting for a table.  We even offered to be split into two adjacent tables, and still, the hostess was convinced it would still take nearly an hour.\n\nSo, we contemplated getting takeout, and were about ready to order when miraculously *poof* a table opened up.  The service was excellent, and the Big Beef Sandwich was great!  Good food, decent atmosphere, although the \""Legalize Marinara\"" T-shirts are a little over the top, especially in a heavy conservative part of town.\n\nAnyway, I'll be back.  The unique and tasty dishes will ensure that."
My experience with Belle Melange was fabulous. I came in on my birthday and Shaunte too care of me right away. The salon is one the nicest I have seen and the service in remarkable. The entire staff is friendly and it appears that they make sure they do no overlap any appointments so that no one is ever kept waiting for any services. Oh did I mention that my hair turned out fabulous! Thank you Shaunte! I will definitely be back.
"I used to LOVE this place. After being here on a bachelorette party this past weekend, I wasn't impressed. It was waayy too crowded on a Thursday night. The crowd wasn't the usual crowd I see and I come to Vegas A LOT (5-6 times a year) Not sure if maybe I just had a bad day that day or was completely sober, I don't really know. All I know was I wasn't impressed.  Where are the good looking people in Vegas hang out now??"
"If you're easily overwhelmed by stores like the Forever 21 and H&M located further down in the Southside Works, give Figleaf a shot!  You'll feel like someone personally sorted through all the junk at the megastores and left you with a color-coded selection of well-chosen clothing, shoes, jewelry, and accessories. The clothes are stylish and reasonably priced-- I picked up a cute maxi dress for summer for under $40!  Although the quality isn't really the best, it's great to pick up a few trendy seasonal pieces without breaking the bank.\n\nOne of the only downsides with a small boutique shop like Figleaf is that they frequently run out of popular sizes in their inventory.  If you want to have your pick from the sizes, you'll have to either take your chances and stop in a few times, or harass the sales girls until they tell you when the next shipment is coming in.  Also, make sure you're aware of the return policy, which is exchanges only...no refunds!"
"If you live near or in Madison, there is no way you have not heard of The Old Fashioned before. It's one of the most popular hangout and food places in the area and it's always on my list of restaurants to bring friends that visit from out of town to.\n\nI love their specials and my favorite is the Monday special -- buy one burger, get one free. You could always share the second burger with a friend. Or if you're like me, you'd eat both of them and feel super stuffed.\n\nMy go-to items at The Old Fashioned are the Old Fashioned burger and the double bratwurst sandwich. The fried cheese curds here are to die for and if you go here, you cannot leave without having tried this Wisconsin delicacy. The dipping sauces add to its greatness.\n\nFinally, be aware that reservations are not taken and that weekends require super long waits. It'll be worth it though if you have the time to spare."
"Scheduled a rental of a Mustang convertible for a day. Exactly 18 minutes before my pickup time, I received a call stating they didn't have my car - I thought to myself, no problem, they will give me something comparable or better at the same price.\n\nThey offered me a Jeep Wrangler - how is that a sports car? I asked for a sports car replacement and they said they could offer me a BMW Z4 at $50 more/day. I said that was not a reasonable suggestion - \""She\"" disagreed with me and said that was all she could do.\n\nI had a day planned to take my wife on a nice trip to Hover Dam - but she said forget it if they can't find a suitable replacement at the same price on my reservation.\n\nTrying to find another comparable car at the last minute was not going to happen from another agency - so we bagged the Hover Dam expedition.\n\nDon't use these guys - they don't treat you like a valued customer."
If you haven't tried this place you had to try it at least once. They have the best ingredients for all their food and some healthy options as well. I love to get the chicken bowl because their burritos are too big and messy. I'd never had a problem with this place and they always give great customer service.
"Too bad the seats I had were all the way at the top. Without my glasses I missed the vibrant costumes.\n\nThe show was pretty faithful to the story, pretty much a line for line recreation. The actors were great, especially the actress that played the role of rafiki (cant quite remember her name).\n\nIf you enjoyed the lion king on film, you will love this show."
"Well.. For starters, my experience here was bad enough it got me to create a Yelp account to share it with any unsuspecting potential ticket buyers.\n\nMy fiance and I wanted to go somewhere fun for New Year's, so we bought two $220 \""VIP Access Hosted Bar at Ghostbar\"" tickets because we wanted a good view of the fireworks for my birthday, which happens to be NYE. The \""VIP Access\"" was supposed to guarantee us access to Ghostbar, per  the ticket agreement and receipt. The Palms was also selling \""All Access\"" tickets which gave people access to all three clubs in the Palms. \n\nWe arrived to pick up our tickets at 9:30pm, and got our \""Hosted Bar\"" wrist bands at 10:30pm (a long line, but makes sense for NYE in Vegas...I think). Then we moved on to the Ghostbar line. Yes, another line. Again, Vegas on NYE -- probably makes sense there are a few lines. Then, wam! We were hit with the news... They apparently overbooked Ghostbar. Birthday fun over. I suspect they over-sold \""All Access\"" tickets and, of course, anyone with \""All Access\"" ticket headed straight for the bar/club with the view, rather than the ground level club. We paid quadruple the price to be in the club with the view because we were not in the mood for an interior crowded pit.\n\nThey tried to make up for it by granting us access to Rain on the ground floor. If you haven't been to Rain, it is your average big walled in black box club with booming music, crowds, and zero view. We were not impressed, and feel totally ripped off. \n\nMaybe if they refunded our ticket cost, put us in the black box club, and treated us like royalty the rest of the night, we could have possibly had a good time. They didn't. \n\nI hear the fireworks were great. Think twice before you give these guys your money and expect something in return. You'd be better off gambling."
The east side store is vastly disappointing. Sales staff are not as well trained as you would think. They talked me into a car stereo that wasn't my first choice. Then scheduled the install. I arrived early and was the first customer of the day. After 20 min the technician saud he wasn't going to be able to install this steteo in my vehicle. Excuse being they didn't have  the needed bracket. Now if I was  driving a Ferrari that might make sense. Only I DRIVE A FORD. \nMy advice...if you're needing expertise. Best Buy East cannot accommodate you.
"Food was ok, I had the chicken and Dumplings, chicken was dry and the dumplings undercooked, the flavors were good but the execution was bad. The service was good, for everyone around us, we got the short end of the stick. Im a very observant person, I people watch and notice things that other people dont. Our server decided to chat it up with the bar tender, a manager, other tables, and avoided doing his job. He was a bit of a smartass that seemed like he was above his job when he chose it, if you dont like it quit dumbass, you work for tips and think you deserve it when in reality he only takes the order and brings our drinks, other people actually bring our food, the least he can do is check in every 5-10 minutes."
"calling it the best ball park in America is a total understatement, its the greatest ever. not a bad seat there. Pittsburgh has been very lucky, we hit home runs with PNC & Console but of course Heinz Field is a turkey. As Meat Loaf would say 2 out of 3 ain't bad!!!!"
I ordered the steak omelet...When my order arrived it had no steak...Then I had the waitress take it back...She gave me a new order that had steak on it...but then the egg wasn't cooked all the way...and I mean it was almost raw. I sent it back for the third time and finally got the right order.
"I wish that I could have got ahold of Sherry's Pampered Pets so that I could have made the reservation that I needed. But after 2 attempts at contacting them by phone and leaving them a voicemail that never got returned, I never even got as far as making the reservation. I waited 3-4 days for a return phone call, and then made reservations elsewhere. If I can't even get ahold of anyone or get a return phone call after leaving a voicemail, I am sure not leaving my dog with you."
"This is the best \""East Coast Style\"" Chinese food I have found in the area, and believe me, I have tried several. Wonton soup is fantastic. A large feeds 3 people. There's 10 wonton in a large. The sweet and sour pork is amazeballs. My bf tried the beef lo mein. He loved it. Mmmm, can't wait to go back again."
"Amazing food! Have been here twice. Very intimate setting, good service & great food. \nGarlic & spinach Nan was so yummy! So is the chicken tiki masala."
Great pork belly tacos.Small plates nice to try many items.Has good energy buzzing.Definitley will be returning next time in Charlotte.
One of the better pizzas I've had in Phx. Sry Domino's!
"I love this room. I fall in love with spaces when they find the gentle magic to be both intimate and open, romantic and friendly, neighborly and exotic. The size of National is perfect for shows - standing room on the floor is maybe 400? When the balcony is open it probably doubles the capacity, but even with just 200 on the floor it doesn't feel empty at all, you just feel right, and lucky to be there watching Sloan (for example ;) in a room that always feels like it's full of old friends. \n\nThe floor is slanted so every view is a good view, this is preferable (to me) over having steps in the middle of the floor to trip you up in the dark. The coat check is at the back of the main room, and the bar is in the lobby - both feel sort of oddly placed but not in a bad way. Drinks aren't crazy over priced and all the staff I've encountered have been super funny and nice. The sound is fairly good, and I think better for warmer, more acoustic shows. \n\nThe building itself is stunning. Inaugurated in 1900 in the heart of St Catherine est it's a historic home for Quebecois theatre, comedy and music and still of of our very best rooms in a city with a fair number of heart breakers. Red, gold, and ornate in the old high way of spectacle love."
"We went here recently as I have read the great reviews. They were NOT kidding! We started out with a haystack of onion rings. (I saw a picture and needed to try them) These onion rings were HUGE! The picture did not do it justice- we ended up taking most of them home.)  I ordered a pulled pork sandwhich and hubby ordered a 3 meat sampler. All of it delicious! BBQ sauce on the side, which was nice. Huge mason jars for drinks, which was great for us, and probably for the servers as well. Highly recommend this place- food came out fast (probably due to it being BBQ and precooked? but isn't that what BBQ is?) Refills on sides, even though we didn't get any since we were stuffed by the onion rings and meals, but nice to know we could have gotten more. A plus in my book!"
"I did remember two things that bugged me. \n\n1. No free Wi-Fi.. I expect free these days\n\n2. The fountain in the kiddie pool  is like a well with water coming out. Kids are attracted to it and naturally they are going to climb on it and play with it. The life-guard kept yelling in our direction every-time a kid started playing with the fountain, which happened often. \n\nKids that age don't know that a life-guard is yelling at them. You can't really hear what they are yelling anyway because it's too far. I figured it out by body language in that when a kid got on the fountain the guard was focused on him/her whistle in hand.\n\nSo either let kids play with the fountain or remove it. What did you think kids were going to do?"
"I suggest paying very close attention to the prices. I went there 8/14/2011 and ordered a stromboli and small drink, when they rang it up he rang up $1 something twice and then $8.50 for the stromboli bringing the total on the register to $12 and some change. When I pointed out that the menu board said that the stromboli is only $7.50 he huffed and said \""fine I'll just make it smaller\"" at that point I turned and wallked out.\n\nBeing only a block from ASU student dorms I wouldn't be surprised if preoccupied students aren't being cheated on a regular basis there."
"The Riviera suffers from a serious case of Old. It isn't just that the structure is old, it's that its spirit seems to be merely lingering, waiting to die, as do much of its staff. That's not to say that it's bad. It's just old. It's various lobby and casino displays are themed around really cool events that happened there fifty years ago (when brass and mirrors were \""in\""), and nothing about what's going on there now. Because there's nothing cool going on there now. \""Riviera! Look how hip we used to be!\"" is a great slogan to sum it up.\n\nMy experience at the Riviera started out with extreme annoyance at how long it took to check in. There were maybe twenty people in line, yet it took about 90 minutes to get to the counter. And then I discovered that they had lost my reservation. After waiting another thirty minutes while the clerk was investigating the situation in a back room, she returned to say that they were able to work something out, and offered two free tickets to some crappy comedy show in their theater. Needless to say, I'd never heard of the comic, and just tossed the tickets.\n\nIf you're going to Vegas for other reasons, and don't plan on being in your room or the casino much, then you could do worse than the Riviera. If nothing else, it's cheap. We were in town for the NAB Show and just wanted cheap lodging, for which Riv came through.\n\nThe Queen Victoria pub is pretty good, and they have a lot of great beers and ales on tap. We had crappy service the first time we ate there, but the servers on the other two occasions made up for it. The fish and chips are excellent.\n\nI also got a kick out of the pool area, because when you step into it from the hotel, you could have just stepped right back into 1960. It kinda made me feel like Frank. I would say that the period decor is spot-on, but it isn't decor; it's original period. If you're shooting a movie and you need a Rat Pack-era pool setting, get your ass to the Riv.\n\nWill I stay there again? Probably not, since I've decided that my life goals need to be moving forward instead of stagnating. Next year I'm aiming for Treasure Island. Not Bellagio, yet. I shouldn't get ahead of myself. But, if someone were to tell me, it's the Riviera or nothing, then sure, I wouldn't mind staying there again. I could use the fish and chips as an excuse."
"Good prices on a lot of cool stuff.  .  The sweets and snacks were on sale 3 for 2, bought some Pizza flavored Gamer Grub here and it's great.  Now I don't have to eat all that greasy food whilst I PvP.\n\nGreat selection of cool stuff and friendly helpful staff."
"I hesitate to write a true review for this place as I have only been there for the grand opening.  I'm not sure if the free food buffet they had was a true sample of their menu or not.  I was impressed by the variety of food they had available, most notably the Teriyaki beef which is among the best I have ever tasted.  Growing up in Hawaii this is no small feat... I used to live off of the stuff.  They also had some interesting drinks available at the bar, including a sparkling sake beer (that is the only way I can think to describe it) that was quite addicting."
"Where do I start, well, let me just make this short and simple....  We had ordered from them the delivery/ catering option to be delivered on the 24th for a Christmas eve party.    40 guests were invited, that's right 40, and would you believe it, they never show up!!!! I mean, no phone call, nothing, the plans  and evenings of 40 HUMAN BEINGS, customers, potential customers, WERE NOT FED and this is on CHRISTMAS EVE for a party, not that easy to just change plans.  And can you believe as the hosts how we felt, this was beyond something terrible, this was a Christmas Nightmare!!! This place was even called the day before at 2:00 to verify the order.  No excuses on this one.\n\n\n Places like this, who could even possibly do this to their customers, or fail to deliver in this fashion, there should be a law against this, this was just wrong, beware people, on just principle I would say this place in not worthy of ones business, after this incident, I am left speechless, it caused soo much stress and heartache, unbelievable..."
"This is a really great library and probably the best in Phoenix! Among the beautiful architectural elements, this place has a pretty descent selection of books and music. There are different levels of the building that gives a great separation. There are lots of areas that allow you to sit a read all the different books. There is also a really cool teenager room that provides a cool hangout for all the young folks. Haven't had any bad experiences yet. Overall a great place to go!"
"This is a review for the craft classes offered at this Joanns location.\n\nI stopped taking classes at this Joanns about 2 years ago because both rooms they offered the classes in were freezing cold.  It was very hard to sit in these rooms for 2-3 hours and learn a craft or work on a project.  I was not the only person who felt these rooms were too cold, the instructors and other \""pupils\"" also thought it was very cold.\nI tried to take another class again this year because there was a new class that very much interested me.  However after 2 years, the freezing cold environment of the room had still not been addressed by the Joanns staff.  You would think the customer and instructor feedback would make them heat the room or get space heaters.  Nope, they just don't care if you are uncomfortable while you are paying to take a class there.  I find that unacceptable and even though the classes are interesting and the instructors are fun and knowledgeable - I will never take a class there again.  How hard can it be to heat a freaking room in the winter?"
Very disappointed.  We drove all the way there today. There was a sign said closed ?? Nothing said on their website!!! They had about 15 people and they closed at 4:30 to take only 15 people in. I don't understand why they wouldn't let more people walk thru. Big let down today. Prolly won't go back for several months Cuz I'm really busy :\\ but I'm calling first this time to see if they are going to close again!!!! Lol
"Who doesn't like a good old juicy medium rare steak, if it there us one place that I admire for being able to maintain the same level of preparation is outback. All if my experiences at the outback were the same as far as fiid goes but service is a different story, thus is why I am not making thus a 5 star review, my server was nice and I am sure he tried to do his best but other than serving the food and giving us the check he was no where to be found. I always had to ask another waiter for stuff which was very frustrating\n\n The food is good no doubt, service is dependent on the server."
"My sister asked me to find a good place to have pre-Christmas dinner with our Mom in Las Vegas and I actually found Scarpetta by searching for top rated restaurants near the strip with foie gras. Seriously. I need my foie gras.\n\nWith the recent foie gras ban in California keeping me from one of my favorite delicacies, I definitely wanted to have it if I was crossing state lines.  Scarpetta stuck out to me because it wasn't a French restaurant, but an Italian one, which is my Mom's favorite... and a great way for everyone to be happy.\n\nScarpetta was perfect. Situated in the new and beautiful Cosmopolitan hotel, it has an amazing view of the Bellagio and definitely has that upscale \""we are dining somewhere really fancy\"" vibe.  The server was really enthusiastic about the dishes and described them each eloquently (I read one person's review that found this annoying, but I thought it was great!) and helped with recommendations for what to order.\n\nStarter:\n\nPOLENTA with Mushrooms. Oh. My God. To DIE FOR. Seriously.  Wow.  Best dish of the night and that's saying a lot because everything was great.\n\nMains:\n\nDuck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Obviously what I ordered and obviously I loved it.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the portion size. Usually when you order ravioli you get like, 4, and are left being hungry, but not in this case. It was a generous portion.  I would have loved there to be more foie gras but that's just being greedy.\n\nFennel Spiced Black Cod - My mom ordered this and it was probably the least interesting thing that we had, but still delicious.\n\nBlack Tonarelli - My sister ordered this and it was also amazing, al dente, just as it should be.  It took about 10 minutes to come out after the rest of the dishes and they kept apologizing profusely for it and then sent out TWO free desserts to make up for it.\n\n(FREE!) Desserts:\n\nMascarpone Cheesecake - lighter than your average cheesecake, which made me like it more.\n\nAmaedi Chocolate Cake - like a lava cake, but better.. the perfect texture / consistency with hot melted chocolate inside... served with almond ice cream...\n\nThis was one of the best Italian meals I've ever had outside of Italy,  and I've tried all of those overrated high end Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. I was expecting much less, thinking this was a bit of a tourist trap that I was buying into for the evening. It ended up being so much more. I was so pleasantly surprised and happy with the experience. Also, no BS portion sizes.. these are hearty portions and you will leave full.\n\nDefinitely one of my top (if not the top) Italian restaurants outside Italy.  I just may need to go visit the Scarpetta in LA."
"I had lunch here just last week and I forgot to post my review. So, I was really surprised at how delicious everything was. I'm a vegetarian and find it difficult to find eating places that have more than one item for me to choose from. The waitstaff was very pleasant and helpful- very courteous. The best dish was the okra, not sure the name of it, but it was awesome! Pricing for the buffet is reasonable and I will definitely return, and bring more people with me!"
"I'm just gonna start off by saying this place is amazing! The food is delicious especially the hummus and the hookah is even better. If your not sure what kind of hookah you want just ask for what you feel like.... fruity, minty, citrus..... and they'll make you something amazing.\n\nAll the servers there are amazing but Bladen is by far the top guy. He will always make you feel welcome and his service is always exceptional.\n\nOverall, this place is amazing!!!"
"Not a good experience. Staff could care less about you as a client. Came in with a large group, one person didn't have a ID, even though was clearly over 21. No problem, we decide to leave, one of the people in our group says BS under his breath and some punk bouncer jumps in his face. Just a poor way to run a business, will be surprised if still in business  by the end of the year. Very poor customer service."
"Ok seriously? So this place is out of control.  I will NEVER return.  I didn't care for Vegas as a whole but this establishment really did it in.  The service was absolutely horrible.  They need some serious Customer Service intervention.  At first sight I was mesmarized, as I am sure all Vegas Virgins are.  We got an impromtu tour across the entire Circus Circus ground because they can't seem to articulate their own maps, but I don't blame them neither could anyone else.  We ran into plenty of people in their Peasant Wing where the project housing/extra rooms are located.  When we finally got to our rooms, after our hour long hike (with 2 kids and  my mother, we were highly amused.  I felt like I had been thrust through a time warp to the 1980s.  WTH!  My husband and I laughed for about an hour at the decor.  I really don't think I had a decent meal the entire time.  I felt like I was vacationing at a mall/airport.  The mallport of America.  The amusement park was pretty fun. My kids had a good time there.  The rides were exciting.  I loved the 4D theater and the roller coaster.  The lines were not long either. That was about the only decent money we spent.  That place needs to be torn down and rebuilt completely...starting from bottom up..all the way up."
"My girl and I came here for their Sunday brunch to enjoy the seafood and hang out with new friends.  While the decor of the restaurant and the service was quite good, it's in the food category where this place was severely lacking.\n\nThe way they do their brunch is buffet style with an assortment of stations which are self serve and two manned stations, one for carving and another for omelets.  Pretty standard setup.  Along with the buffet they had unlimited tapas that could be ordered for the table.\n\nMeeting our friends there for a Sunday bite was nice.  The table was comfortable, the atmosphere up scale and everyone was generally pleasant.  That's the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars.\n\nThe buffet suffered from the one cardinal sin of any buffet type offering, the food was left out too long.  Congealed mac & cheese, sushi with crunchy rice and sausage that had been dried out from being exposed for so long.  On top of that, none of the shrimp had been cleaned.  Not the large cold shrimp with cocktail sauce or the small shrimp tossed into the omelets.  That's beyond gross and completely unacceptable for a seafood restaurant of that caliber.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather do the brunch at the Ballantyne Resort.  This place was not worth the money and with such a poor showing I won't even try them for dinner."
"First things first ... THIS IS NOT A REGULAR COSTCO! It's a \""business center.\"" \n\nI feel that this is very important to mention, because I was very disappointed when I came during my weekend stay in Vegas. My bf and I wanted to hit up Costco for a case of water for our room and to get alcohol for a friend's bday gift.\n\nNO ALCOHOL SOLD HERE. Although, they do sell tobacco if you're into that kind of thing. \n\nNO FOOD COURT. But, why would you want a food court when you can eat at all the delicious food places and buffets on the strip?! \n\nAs I mentioned, this is a business Costco so you'll definitely find lots of snacks and drinks for vending machines. They even sell vending machines here! I did enjoy the fact that they had a huge array of drinks (juices, sodas, sparkling water, cider, etc.) It was quite impressive. \n\nAll in all, this Costco was pretty depressing. Very few workers ... workers that don't really know their stuff. I asked the guy checking memberships at the front if they had any coupon books and he said the guest/member service would have some. Waited in line and it turns out ... THEY DON'T EVEN ACCEPT THE COUPONS HERE. \n\nI'll definitely be shopping at the Costco back in L.A. before heading out to Vegas next time.."
"Delicious hot sandwiches,  opened 24 hours, what more do I need to say?\n\nOh, get the meatball sandwich! SO GOOD!"
"I ordered an item (pizza oven) to be delivered Dec. 24th as a gift and it finally showed up  Jan. 5th and it is broken .They said they could deliver a new one in one week, January 16th too late for the party December 25th, January 1st, January 8th,January 15th, the national college championship game.No one should buy anything from them and expect to receive it in working order when you may need it. They will not assist you with a return, you are on your own.Go ahead,buy your wife a gift and piss her off!!! This review is for the online store only ,the people at the Biltmore store are wonderful and extremely helpful."
"Catering Catering Catering\nIf you are having a party or event and your looking for causal quality Mexican food, do yourself a favor and call Tacos N' More in Maricopa!  All the fixings and extras were included, food was hot and packaged perfectly.  We ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I have eaten in the restaurant and the catering was the same great quality.  I want to have another party just so I can call Tacos N' More to cater again!  If you are in Maricopa please support this great local business!!"
"Five stars for food and three stars for prices. I love the Ruebens (yes, they have multiple kinds of them)! I am not so much in love with the price tag. Rueben with drink, tax, and tip comes in around $15. \n\nThat said, I have eaten at Chompie's around 30 times. I really do like the service and the food. Would recommend for others."
So good! Perfect for comfort food! Just amazing food!
"my buddy and i came here for dinner recently since it was close by to our conference hotel.. \n\nwe were seated promptly despite not having reservations and it was relatively packed house.. \n\nservice was prompt and friendly.. my buddy got the duck confit and i got the beef cheek bourguignon.. the execution was spot.. the duck confit was crispy, ducky and beautifully prepared... my beef cheek bourguignon was phenomenal.. really a simple dish.. but the beef was ridiculously tender.. the braise was rich and hearty.. \n\nall this was washed down with beer.. \n\nif i'm back in montreal.. i'd definitely head back here.. it seems like it was packed with locals"
"In Phoenix we all are subject to a number of poor food choices that claim they're \""authentic\"", and its anything but. However all is not lost: Behold the great Pho Thanh, the best Vietnamese food in the valley. Lets slurp up a bowl of pho-knowledge in this review on this restaurant!\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nThis small, unassuming restaurant off of Camelback has amazing flavors popping out of the kitchen. The Pho is fresh, not made from different canned ingredients. The dishes are out of this world and very much authentic. For a good starter, the spring rolls they make are huge and sumptuous. With mint, shrimp, and pork, my personal favorite is Goi Cuon. As for entrees, by far the best out of my first three visits is #31 on the menu, Mi Xao Don . The freshly cooked veggies along with cooked pork and fresh broth-boiled seafood mix amazingly together atop a bed of crispy egg noodles. If you can stand waiting a few minutes, I suggest crushing the noodles, add a bit of soy sauce/ other sauces, and let the noodles soak it all in. All the dishes are succulent, savory, and the prices for the quantity of food is out of this world. I have left each time with leftovers, the portions are that big. They have over 100 separate dishes, the list is extensive, to say the least. They do not serve alcohol here, however the list of soft drinks and traditional Vietnamese offerings like baby coconut milk or thai tea is......extensive once again. \n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nThis is the reason they lose a star. I am not a big atmosphere person, unless it simply detracts from the experience all-together. There are three separate issues to point out. First, the music and decor in the restaurant....they  are \""interesting\"". They have it seemingly on a looped CD with Vietnamese covers of popular American music. I cannot tell a lie, at one point \""She Bangs\"" came on... I hadn't heard that in over 5 years, folks. The decor is once again \""interesting\"" and detracts from the experience. Instead of adding to the atmosphere and putting up traditional pictures or decor, they have two separate posters of a woman threading a blanket. TWO posters....as if one is not enough. Second, is the bathroom. You can smell it as you walk towards it. They seem to not have a scheduled time to clean up the bathroom each day, its pretty bad. Third, the service is extremely prompt, let me make this abundantly clear.  Faster than I have seen at most food establishments for that matter. But if you were to ask them for recommendations, it may prove to be difficult, as they are in a hurry to service other tables. We do not get many smiles or get asked how we are doing....To be honest, I am sure its a cultural thing. I shrug it off, if you take things like that to heart then you need to check yourself. Overall, these aren't hideous issues, but a star lost is more than fair, in my mind.\n\n~Extras/Rating~\nOverall, the food is outstanding. They get 4 stars for variety of choices, quality/taste of food, price point in comparison to quanitity, and lightning fast service. But honestly, \""She Bangs\""?  If not for those issues, its a 5 star top choice for me. Regardless, this has become my favorite go-to spot locally. I have gone 3 times the past two weeks, and at some point this week and next I shall go again....and I can't wait. Bring on the Pho Thanh, I say!!!  Enjoy!"
"The Dane is always a great fall back when every other restaurant is packed; or when you crave some delicious pub grub! The food is typical Wisconsin cuisine but definitely above average. They brew their own beers, so depending on the season can differ, but are equally delicious. not to mention you can buy a jug of it to take home with you.\nAs with all restaurant around/near the square The Dane can fill up quickly on Friday/Saturday evenings. But the wait isn't terribly bad, especially if you can muscle up to the bar and satisfy your thirst while waiting."
"Our waitress was friendly. However, we waited a long time for our food for a party of 4, about 40 mins. We were seated at 1:30pm and there weren't even a lot if guests. All we ordered were 2 omelets, steak and eggs special, and a bowl of lobster bisque, so we didn't expect it to take that long! We already each finished 3 cups of coffee before our food arrived. :(\n\nPrices are average. $10-$13 for omelets, $10-$12 for sandwiches and salads, $12-$20 pasta. $9 for a bowl of soup. They have $5 mimosas and bloody mart all day.\n\nFood taste and quality was okay, I'd compare it to Denny's but with smaller portions. I did not like the lobster bisque, it was too salty. I recommenf just sticking with the specials, they're also cheaper. My brother's steak (5 oz ny strip) and eggs was only $7.95.\n\nOverall, it was not bad, not great. Just okay."
"There's a reason we are told to be at the airport two hours in advance.  Had I left earlier, I wouldn't  have missed my flight at 7:30pm the Friday before labor day. \nThe US Air representative was kind enough to rebook me on the next flight out.  Unfortunately the next flight wasn't until 6 am the next morning.   Since it was Labor Day weekend; the check in line was long. I decided to grab a quick bite to eat then come back.   I returned less than 15 minutes later and gone were the customer service representatives,  and  self service check in counters had closed. \nI thought maybe they took a lunch break or something.  So I waited,  waited, and waited some more.  There were several other US Air passengers there also. I  also checked Us Air's , but no one was there either. \n I called the customer service line, and was transferred to US AIR's Hartsfield Jackson  number.  Frustrating doesn't even begin to describe how one feels when the customer service number rings the check in counter you're standing in front of.  Anyway I spoke with the same customer service 4 different times before she  told me US Air's reps would not return until 3:30am . \nThere is absolutely no excuse that I had to call customer service FOUR times before getting a straight answer.   Someone should have been able to assist me by my second call. That's not an unreasonable expectation, is it? \nAtlanta Hartsfield Jackson is nation's busiest airport. As such someone should be on call especially on holiday weekends where increased travel should be anticipated.  Delta and Air Tran both had customer service representatives on call."
Went for my first time to the lunch buffer.  It was fabulous.  Great food. Worth the $11.
"Delicious Thai food at a very reasonable price.  The Phat Thai is amazing, and whenever you order something spicy they ask what level of spice you want in your dish.  I've never tried anything hotter than medium because the medium is VERY spicy.  Really love their red curry as well as coconut ice cream made right at the restaurant.  The atmosphere is very quiet - mostly older couples or small groups dining together."
"On Easter weekend, we called Animal Inn regarding their rates.  They informed about their price but failed to tell us about an additional rate being that it's Easter.  They did however, remember to tell us that they close early on Easter Day.\n\nWe brought our Tibetan Spaniel there and she absolutely did not want to go in.  The workers are not friendly and/or accomodating at all.  Terrible service all the way around.  We asked them why they couldn't tell us that there were extra fees over the phone when we called and they just said \""well that's how it is\"".   We would be happy to pay the extra money, but not when they intentionally fail to tell us to accomodate their business.  \n\nUpon picking our dog up, no one greeted me as I entered the door, so I stood there waiting as they were all staring at me, until someone had the descency to acknowledge a customer.  They were rude, very unfriendly, and did not seem to care about the animals.  \n\nOur dog seemed a little traumatized after we brought her home to bathe and feed her.  \n\nI DO NOT recommend this place to anyone!"
This is where I usually go when visiting downtown. The atmosphere is great. I think its what makes this place. Its dark with a fireplaces and brick walls. There is also a dance floor and dj in the back. Last time I got a pretty rude bartender though. Only negative thing I have to say.
"But the rooms are nice but don't do the timeshare meeting no matter how much they ask or offer. It will ruin your trip. If you say no, they get very rude. I was considering buying timeshare with Hilton but after this experience I will never consider it. I will spend my money with Disney. I would give more stars but my experience with the timeshare people left a bad taste in my mouth."
Can I tell you how much I love this nail place!! They all do an amazing job on my nails every time I am in there!! I go every two weeks n they really are the best!! Perfection every time and every nail tech is so SO good!! I've been going there for about 6 months n every time is perfect!!
"One very, very blurry night a few months ago, I was showing an out of town friend around the Strip.  He wanted to go to a buffet in a bad way.  We were right by Harrah's, so against my better judgement, that's where we ended up.  Let's just say $22 a head was outragious for what was offered.\n\nFirst, I was hungry.  Second, I wasn't expecting much, but thought I could eat just about everything.  Nothing looked appetizing to me, even through my beer goggles.  Everything looked old, the place was kind of depressing.  I wouldn't think anyone would really consider ending up here, but if for some reason you are - please think again.  There are better, cheaper buffets in town, I promise."
"I don't frequent a lot of sushi places, but when I do, it's always Kobe Sushi Bistro. We decided to give this place a try, since it is so close to our house, and let me say that we are definite repeat customers. \n\nWe don't eat much, so we usually come in when it's happy hour, which is after 5PM on weekdays, and all day on the weekends. The HH menu isn't bad, has different types of teriyaki, salads, and a pasta dish. 50% off rolls, and 30% off sushi. For two of us, two rolls, and two entrees plus sodas is only about $15 a person, not bad!\n\nThe service is EXCELLENT. The wait staff is super friendly, and the busser there is so quick to pick up plates and refill drinks. The atmosphere is welcoming, warm, and dark, good for a private dinner. They have TV's which broadcasts games, which is perfect for sake bombs!\n\nFood wise, above average. The rolls are plentiful and the happy hour items are generous. The salad has a very nice, subtle dressing that really refreshes the plate. The different types of teriyakis are great, but basic, and the Korean BBQ is fantastic, albeit a little greasy. Tonight though, I had the beef teriyaki, and part of the tail end of the steak was sour. It was probably just going bad, but that was the only piece that tasted bad, the rest of the steak was great. \n\nFor those complaining about the servers frequently checking on the tables, it's natural for them because a good number of the customers get the all-you-can-eat specials, and they are required to push more sushi out and ask if you want more. \n\nAll in all, great service, tasty food minus the sour beef, and a nice atmosphere. 8.5/10 because I've never had a sour taste of beef before."
Great beer. Great people.
"Went here because of the beautiful building and positive reviews... We were disappointed to say the least. Soggy chimichanga, mushy rice, bland machaca and chicken, chips that tasted like supermarket chips, and mediocre salsa."
"Whether you're in Lima or Napoli, Southern European and Southern American cities have similarities, they still have bustling produce, fish and meat markets with restaurants that blend in with the chaos. Wooden tables without napkins. Sturdy cutlery. Pots, pans, dishes, and plates in all sorts of shapes and textures, just like the patrons. Layers of seafood on ice along the bar. And of course, the sizzling of onions and shallots (the aromatic of choice for French cuisine) filling the dining room. Patrons gossiping and boasting about their lives, all in all an orgy of noises and smells.\n\nThe problem is, we are not in Sao Paolo, but in Montreal, in the bowels of Le Plateau. This is chef Martin Picard's Au Pied de Cochon. The acclaimed Chef attaches his beginnings to Montreal going back to the early 1990's.\n\nThe raison d'etre of Au Pied de Cochon is to delight its customers, as much through its exquisite food as through its friendly atmosphere. When it is a question of pure pleasure, one would have a hard time convincing that the feeling of fresh vegetables cracking in your mouth, as good as it may be, is as pleasurable or as intense as a piece of meat, cooked perfectly, especially at the moment it releases its fat and its juices, filling the body with warmth an instantaneous feeling of well being. \n\nOne thus goes to Au pied de cochon for the comforting pleasures of a meat-plentiful and generous kitchen, terroire inspired. Martin Picard is a larger-than-life character, for whom eating well means eating a lot, and drinking well means drinking a lot.\n\nLike the changing temperatures of the seasons, the kitchen at Au Pied de Cochon offers a variety of seasonal fare. Without giving up the pillars of the meat repertoire that characterizes the restaurant, Martin Picard's estival cuisine includes a large number of fish and seafood dishes. During the winter the menu goes through a dramatic transformation.\n\nMost dishes have only four or five easily identifiable ingredients, in balanced proportions. Chef Martin Picard does get clever with one pervasive product: foie gras. It comes in nearly a dozen combinations, including stuffed into a ham hock, with poutine, and in an interesting creation called \""Duck in a Can\"" which does, indeed, come to the table with a can opener. Somehow! this canned duck provided us with succulent meat without any of the chewy fat that is usually expected. After having magret de canards in Montreal in the past, none have come close to satisfying me like this dish.  A heap of mushrooms and onions covered the deep colored duck strips, which were teased to perfection by the chef. \n\nThe main courses are for carnivores and pescivores. We were tempted by but did not try any of the large plates of seafood on a bed of crushed ice. The zucchini flowers were delicately fried and sprinkled with fleur de sel, and the calamari was light and citrus filled accompanied by caviar.\n\nWhen you feel like another bite will send you into a cholesterol-induced coma, maple syrup cake is the only fitting finish.\n\nThis is not an establishment for sensitive stomachs and underperforming livers!"
"You won't be disappointed with this place! \n\nAte here with my bestie Carly R a little while back. Been meaning to post a review for a while now. The food, oh wow, the food. Where shall I start. ... red velvet cookies get a 2 thumbs up . I've never had an item I didn't tremdously like. Carly loved her BBQ meatless chicken. \n \nDo be prepared to splurge$$$  it's definitely in the higher price point.  Even for Vegan food which is why I'm giving them 4 starts and not 5. Still in my opinion one of the best Vegan restaurant in town."
"This place was awesome! We had excellent attentive, knowledgeable service. The food was all fantastic and they really let us take our time and enjoy each course slowly, which I enjoyed (they had asked if we had any later commitments, like any shows we were seeing....I assume they would have sped things up if we had said yes, but we enjoyed taking our time here). Fantastic food, great service, but it's definitely pricey! They also gave us a unique chickpea bruschetta (sounds a little funny but it was delicious) compliments of the chef, as well as some nice little dessert bites from the pastry chef. Loved it!"
Great place! I love their veggie burger!
This store is always too busy. Be sure to bring your favorite pillow because it will be a  hour before someone can help you.
"Shrimp is really good, I always get a steak and that's good too. The butter cake is delish but the service isn't friendly and I have came back here multiple times."
I was really disappointed at this place. The oysters were disgusting (not cleaned or sweet). The combo pan roasts that yelpers raved about had no lobster and the broth had a lot of crab shell. Not worth the wait or my time. To top it off the chef was rude and not professional. Never again Oyster Bar.
"I went in for and met the Dr. very, very briefly. We decided not to do anything. I still got a bill. I don't recommend going here."
My husband and I LOVE this place! We have been coming since they opened. We used to travel to the Rainbow location until they opened the one up near where we live in north las vegas. The food is delicious! They have the best eggs benedict in town and I have tried almost everything in the breakfast menu and everything is great! The atmosphere is great and they have a great staff! Love the service!
Food was worth the money- larger sizes. Menu is wayyyy to large and could be downsized or split in an AM PM vs having 10 pages of food chooses. The interior was well thought out w wide range of art. We had 4 different burgers all were great. Love the different French fry options
"$20! for terrible food! Ugh!\n I was very disappointed with my experience at America. During long layover I'm Vegas I decided to go on the strip for a few hours. I needed to start with breakfast. I passed up 48TH and Crepes because the line was really long and there was no where to sit. My weariness led me to make the bad choice of choosing America.  I knew going on the food was overpriced for what they were serving but i was really tired after flight.\nI ordered the Chicken and Waffles and after waiting 20 min for my order, even though the place was slow, I saw my food and knew right away I was going to regret choosing this place. It came with 3 pieces of chicken which could have came fron a chick they were so tiny. I could tell the chicken was bought prepared and heated up. It had that familiar orangey color diner chicken has where the establishment is too lazy to flour chicken themselves. Lots of places actually serve this chicken and it's not bad tasting but it can easily be dry. Of course those tiny pieces were far from moist. The Waffles were crunchy on the outside and fluffy in the middle, nothing spectacular about the flavor. But my guess is that any place who doesn't take pride in preparing their own chicken, probably bought the waffle mix prepared as well.\nFunny that the restaurant is called America, pretty ironic. Lazy, no pride in your product, over charging customers, the buck you make is more important then the goods they are pedaling.  Is that what they are saying America is? \n The service was great, that's the only reason I gave them a star. Seriously how hard is it to make your own fried chicken?"
"Messed up the order and then proceeded to tell me that it was my fault. Apparently almond chicken sounds like orange chicken and she said I was lying. Okay! Yah I lied about what I ordered! Horrible customer service and the \""orange chicken\"" I supposedly ordered was soggy and disgusting."
Pricey but hey..it's Vegas.\nGreat drinks - they're strong and yummy!\nGood selection of songs and nice variety. \nLove the view!!!\n\nPS Check out the bathroom ;)
I tried this place because of all the wonderful reviews.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the mama signature pizza and a dinner salad. The salad is something I would expect from a lousy fast food place.  The pizza was flavorless and the crust was just a soggy mush.  I will not be eating her again.
You don't get much for your player card status at Mirage . Wi-Fi Internet access in the hotel room is terrible; which you are paying for with a resort fee.
"Started getting pizza here after moving to the area and sometimes it was good, other times, I felt that the pizza had way too much cheese and was too salty. Recently, we ordered more items including, pizza, chicken parm sandwich, cold roast beef sandwich, and mozz sticks. The pizza was cold, not cooked enough, very heavy, too much cheese. The chicken parm barely had any chicken on it, chicken tasted frozen, def not fresh, bread was so soggy, too much sauce. The sauce is horrible. It didn't taste fresh at all, was very dark red, salty, either cooked way too long, or had too many spices in it. The roast beef sub was gross, roast beef was gray and rubbery, not good quality meat, asked for extra oil and vinegar, and sandwich was drenched in olive oil. The mozz sticks were not fresh at all and as hard as a rock. Will NEVER give them my business again. Total waste of money and nothing at all like NY style pizza or food. (59th Ave location)"
"My husband's family took us to a concert at the Jobing.com arena. We needed somewhere close to eat. All restaurants were swamped from concert goers, but when we walked up to the packed Yard House, they were very accommodating and we took their last table outside. Thankfully on a hot summer day, the misters and prompt service of water made everything okay.\n\nWhile the restaurant was totally full, our waiter never seemed stressed and checked in on us often. He was very knowledgeable about all the beers and even provided our table with a sample.  I tried a happy hour martini. I would never not pay happy hour prices for their drinks. It was okay, but I think if I am ever there again, I would just get a glass of wine (since I don't drink beer)\n\nAs for the food, I chose their 4 cheese pizza which was on happy hour pricing. It was 11 inches and only 6 dollars and change! What a deal and a yummy pizza to boot! I decided to add pepperoni onto it. Each topping is 1.00. My husband and his sister had burgers which were some of the best I have tried. Be warned that their BBQ sauce is on the sweeter end, but all sauces for your burgers are on the side. Their fries are those yummy thin fries that make it easy for you to eat a lot of them. Members of our table also ordered a Cobb Salad which was good and Jambalaya. If you can't make it to New Orleans, this will do the trick!\n\nI would have given this place a three if it wasn't for the pizza (especially with the amazing happy hour price) and the burgers. So I say come during happy hour."
The last few times I have been there the staff has been horrible. The don't pay attention and then when I ask again for them to add something I already asked for they give an attitude. The food isn't that great to have to deal with staff that don't care. Chipotle is the better option anyways for fast food Mexican in Oakland.
Service at Audi Henderson is awesome. I have never felt so comfortable with anyone. Brett is an awesome guy and he is so helpful. I seriously would keep my Audi because of this guy and will continue to buy Audi just so I can take my car to him. LoL. Awesome guy.
"Good, large burger (got Paris one)\nAvg. fries\nAwesome milkshake!\n\nGot $30 groupon and really enjoyed it!"
"My business partner and I met there for an impromptu lunch and discover a hidden gem.  We took the server's recommendations  for the roasted corn pizza with bacon, then the burger with arugula, tomato, caramelized onion and provolone. ( many other toppings available), and the roasted duck club sandwich. All we amazing, fresh and cooked perfectly.  Just found a new favorite!"
Group of 8 and had no desire to seat us!! Did not want to let us split up I to 4 and 4. Wanted to put us all on one check!! Not toe room receptionist was pushing 50 in buttless chaps!
"I've been going to Rositas for probably 10-15 years and mainly at lunch during the work week. The tacos are great, the enchilads are chessy and taste good but also a gut bomb that makes you want to take a nap. Unfortunately this has always been one of my go to places and would normally give it 4 stars; however, I finally took the family this past Sunday and the food was OK not as good as usual and the service was awful. The waitress did not seem happy to be serving us, got one of the orders wrong (which we couldn't fix because we didn't see her for 20 more minutes), we got the tortillas for fajitas 20 minutes after the fajitas and the check took another 20 minutes to wait for. I would typically go here every month but hadn't been in a 3-4 months so I am hoping this was a one off and the next visit will be better and not that the place has gone down hill."
We went to Edinburgh Castle early on a Sunday morning trying to beat the crowds and it definitely worked.  The castle is very well preserved and a must see attraction while in Edinburgh.
Good car wash at a good price.
"The food was excellent.  If you can overlook the apathetic hostess/waitress, who was totally put out that we failed to make a reservation, even though the entire eating area was empty, and her horrid customer service, by all means - go, check it out.  We each ordered a glass of wine, which was finally delivered to the table 15 minutes after our food arrived at the table.  Nothing like sitting with water and three rounds of pita for 45 minutes.  We asked 3 different people for the wine, including the waitress.  Loved the food, there's nothing like it where we live and we were excited to check this restaurant out after seeing it on yelp.  You're only allotted 3 small  pita rounds at any given time - God forbid you ask for more, they acted like there was a pita famine in Madison.  The waitress never checked on us, never asked if the food was good, never asked if we were done and if we wanted a box.  We finally had to flag someone else down and ask for the check.  When she brought the check, she slammed it down on the table and stormed off.  There appeared to be several regulars here, eating out on date night - she seemed at least mildly interested in them.  We own a business, and I would never for a minute consider treating people that way the staff at this establishment did.  It was appalling."
"I was intrigued by the great reviews of Pita House. A good middle eastern restaurant is difficult to find. \n\nUnfortunately, Pita House falls short. Falafel was not very good. Tastes bland and a bit stale as if it was sitting around for awhile. The pita bread was not fresh at all, way too chewy.  The service was actually really good.. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, because the place looked authentic and the reviews seemed favorable.\n\nI was very disappointed.\n\nBy the way, my standard for falafel is Mamoun's Falafel in Manhattan, NY with 1000+ reviews. That's how falafel is done..."
"I am giving this 2 stars because of the nightclub.  I probably would have given 3 or maybe even 4 for dinner. \n\nDinner: Obviously expensive.  We had reservations and still waited 20 minutes.  Maybe this is normal in Vegas but I thought it was crazy when they make you make the reservation, give your credit card number, and then call the day of to confirm. Hello, we are going to come.  My husband and I had the duck and really liked it.  They lure you in by saying you get a wristband for the club if you eat there, but don't tell you that you must purchase a $40-$50 entree to get that band. Service was mediocre.  In all, the food was satisfying. But go for the expensive food, not to get into the night club. \n\nNightclub: awful.  If 500 people left, it may have been fun.  You couldn't move, and not in a good way.  It was uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all.  The bartenders were rude.  It took minimum 20 minutes to get a drink.  The drinks were minimum $14. We left after 30 minutes (maximum).  Veryyyy disappointing."
"About one hour into the movie (there were only two of us in the theatre), I notice a shadowy figure enter the arena and walk up almost to the top row where I was seated. He then went down and walked across the floor and did the same thing on the other aisle. Is this Harkins policy to disturb moviegoers and distract patrons by traversing through the place midway through a movie? I nearly yelled out to see what this usher was doing because after what happened in CO, you don't want to be wandering around the theatre. Somehow else might go after the guy if they didn't know this was the Harkins stupid policy. Will send a letter to corporate to confirm that this is acceptable. It was $7 for a matinee and the sound system was good, but back to AMC where nobody is stalking me during the movie. Lose the policy."
"We went in with high hopes after a friend recommended Delmonico but we left just a bit disappointed.  The ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.  \n\nMy friend and I both started with lobster bisque, which was good but a little thin.  We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\n\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \n\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \""Emerel's Blend\"" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \n\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner."
Came here for the first time. A roach crawled on my arm the first five minutes. Not a good thing.
"Just ate at this shit box, Ajo Al's in Glendale. Very disappointed in our dinning experience. I wish I'd have read some of the reviews before going. The only positive I have is that the interior was aesthetically pleasing. Completely downhill from there. We ordered two margaritas, on the rocks, with two shots of Grand Marnier. It took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks and the shots of Grand Marnier were only a 1/2 oz. each. We had to request a full one oz. shot, and wait another 10 minutes for it to transpire. The food was nothing spectacular, if not overpriced. At the end of the meal we ordered two more margaritas, this time melon, and again a we waited. Our empty plates and glass wear were never cleared from the table. When we left, the remanence from everything we ordered was still on the table, and everything took exceedingly long... Do not waist your time and money if you are expecting any kind of good dining experience.\nI've had better \""generic brand salsa\"", and I doubt if they even know what a jalapeno is."
"Like a lot of the other yelpers on here, I visited because I saw it on Man Vs Food. \nWe arrived about 11am, and although it didn't look busy we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated.\n\nI can't fault our server, she was attentive, knowledgeable, and very friendly. \nWe both ordered French Toast, and just had coffee to drink.\n\nYes the portions were huge, and they had loads of pecan nuts on top, but the toast itself wasn't anything amazing, and costs a lot more than Denny's!\n\nI wasn't that impressed - if I did go again I think I'd try one of the Hash dishes."
"Fuck you and your worthless bum casino. \n\nI was having my way blocked by a bunch of crippled old fuckers that kept blocking my way with their old people walking crutch things. So I decided to cut across the casino tables until a rude pit boss stopped me. \n\nI only go to this piece of shit crackhead spot because I wanted the free parking. I have never, ever, frequented the methhead slot machines. But I did go to Cafe Cortez, which is overpriced for their shoddy tasting food. \n\nDon't come here in a suit, crackhead \""hustlers\"" that sell you CDs and bother you for cigarettes are right OUTSIDE the automatic doors."
"First of all, this has nothing to do with Tapino's food or service. It may be great. In fact, that's what we were hoping.\n\nSecondly, we are big fans of what Chef Porter is trying to do. We have great respect for them advocating the locavore movement & using local farms & vendors. We're huge fans of local farmers markets & buy all our produce there. We're also huge fans of local independent restaurants & business and patronize them as much as possible.\n\nSo the birthday fail begins...\n\nOne more thing. Birthdays in my family are a big deal. Food is a big deal. We all grew up working in my dad's restaurant (the Glass Door) & food is hugely important to us. For birthdays, we do a fancy dinner & a family dinner. This was a family dinner. Lots of thought goes into choosing the place for each occasion. This was also my wife's birthday. Kind of a big deal for me. \n\nFor family dinner, we all go so we need a place that isn't too hard on the budget & that suits different dietary needs (some vegetarians, some food allergies). Looked at a ton of places & figured that we should try Tapino as they had a great food/drink special & we were into what they are doing. Figured it would be a gateway meal to us coming back a great deal more. \n\nOk, very last thing, kids... So we brought our kids. We've brought our kids out to eat since they were born & they know & appreciate good food. They've been places like Sea Saw, Nobu, Bouchon, etc. They know how to behave & are always expected to behave.\n\nSo to the story...\n\nCalled Tapino yesterday & spoke to the manager & asked if they could take a party of 12 for happy hour. She said they normally don't take reservations for happy hour but would be ready for us. Asked if they had 2 high chairs for the kids. She said no but they had low chairs & low tables on the patio that would work great. So we're in good shape, right?\n\nWell today, I walk in myself (without kids) & say that we are here for the party of 12 w/kids. The hostess said no kids allowed in bar nor on patio (as they allow smoking on the patio) & they don't serve happy hour in the restaurant & just lets it sit at that. Pretty weird. Was almost as if they'd were ready for us. \n\nOk, so if you don't want kids in your place...at least tell us. I dragged 12 people out & set their expectations & was excited to have the perfect place to celebrate my wife's birthday. Then we get there & you say sorry, nope?\n\nAlso, there wasn't a single person in the restaurant at this time. It was about 5:45. Not one.\n\nI'm like in shock so I tell her I spoke with someone yesterday & she understood our situation & that we were coming in. She said that she was right there when I spoke with her manager & they don't allow kids in the bar or on the patio & they don't do happy hour in the resturant. Ok, I get it. Probably heard this 7 times when I was there.\n\nMight as well have said go away, leave, we don't want you here.\n\nShe eventually said that the manager was there & she'd have her come talk with me.\n\nDuring the wait, I asked about last night's locavore dinner & told her we were excited to be there as we'd been following them on Chowhound & the Phoenix Hound Gathering group. Also told her I'd been talking with one of the farmers that was in for the previous night's event. Basically I let her know we know what they did & were into it. Might have factored in a bit? Nope.\n\nEventually, the manager came out & they chatted.\n\nThe manager then came over & changed the story & said we could sit in the bar at a couple of benches but kept reiterating that the kids couldn't make any noise nor move around at all. Ok, fine. First of all, we expect the kids to behave. If she'd left it with one mention, maybe we'd have just sat down. But with repeated mentions of no noise, no moving around, it was obvious they didn't want us there. I told her I felt that way & she said that wasn't the case but it rang quite hollow.\n\nI went outside to talk with the family & figured we'd probably go elsewhere as we really weren't wanted. Went in to tell the hostess (manager was nowhere around) & got a perfunctory sorry.\n\nJust seems like such a customer service failure. If they'd wanted us there, they could have refrained from making us feel unwelcome. Or if they were uncomfortable with kids being in the bar or on the patio, they could have easily set us up in the empty restaurant & offered us the same food/drink.\n\nOr they could have told us their mantra \""no kids in the bar or on the patio, no happy hour in the restaurant\"" on the phone. \n\nMaybe it was a bad situation for them but if it were me, I would have tried a little bit harder to find a solution that wouldn't have so alienated us.\n\nI don't know. I'm epxecting to see Chef Porter at OTFM & am friends with people who work with him & maybe we'll come back (sans kids of course) but right now it sure doesn't feel like it & it's a major bummer as Tapino seems like a place that is doing excactly what we love & we could have been huge fans."
"Went to see Joe Nichols last night and was disappointed in a few things.  First of all my friend and I went to the bar to get a drink and they don't accept credit cards!  What established bar/event venue doesn't accept credit?? Then the real problem arose... during the concert, some drunk idiots started causing issues.  One guy spilled his beer all over everyone around him and they were bumping and pushing people.  Someone went to get the bouncer and he just came and told the guy to stop.  Obviously that didn't do anything so the problem continued.   This was all during my favorite song which really made me mad.  The bouncer ended up coming back and getting the guys.  Later, during another GREAT song, the guys came back and pushed in front of us.  Next thing you know the guy got in a fight with all the other people around him.  It was a huge brawl and it took a good long time for any bouncers to arrive.  I felt very unsafe this whole time and it was because of the lack of awareness and/or the lack of care that the bouncers had for the well being of the patrons.  Will probably not be going back and will definitely not recommend going to any of my friends."
"The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. More than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be \""krab\"", considering the price of the buffet. No pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup."
Oh my gosh!  Hot dogs-great; onion rings-great; chili cheese fries-great; 50 cent soft serve cones-awesome.  Just want to add that so far there hasn't been anything that we've tried here that we haven't liked.
"I'm reviewing both the bookstore and the Starbucks that is located in the store.\n\nThe bookstore is huge, great selection on books, and the people there are very helpful. They have great periodical selections and a good place to just relax and read a good article - even though you should really buy it rather than reading it there. \n\nNow for the Starbucks in the store. \nNote: I'm not really a big Starbucks reviewer, but this one is an exception. \n\nI was there tonight, reading some periodicals on the comfy chair that's laid out throughout the store. I kept hearing the guy behind the counter - Daniel (I asked for his name while ordering a cup of java). Anyway, I was amazed at how great he was interacting with every customer walking up to the counter. He was very friendly, charming, and a great sales guy promoting their Venti size drinks for 25\u00a2 more... great tactic! I fell for it. :) After I ordered my coffee and cookie, I sat there observing his people skills and he was just GREAT! The way he spoke to everyone seemed like he knew who they were and by hearing him, I could just tell he was good at talking to people. \n\nHe did a great job making people's drink quickly and calling the customer by their name when their drinks were ready. \n\n5 Star for Daniel @ Starbucks."
The California Club and Breakfast Buzz are both amazing
Okay we went here with my husbands family and that makes I think it was 16 of us and the service was INCREDIBLE!!!!! \nNot one person had to ask for a refill. They were completely attentive and as there were 4 children among us they were very happy to accommodate dishes for them as well. \nIf you eat another Rib eye steak please let it be at Austin Steakhouse!!!!! \nOMG this was the most wonderfully DELICIOUS steak EVER!!!! \nThe Lobster Bisque was smooth and creamy with several nice size chunks of lobster unlike many places where you may get two or three slivers. As I could barely eat the entire steak I could just barely manage tastes of a couple sides. I sampled the Sauteed Spinach with Shitake Mushrooms and the White Cheddar Mac & Cheese which were both extremely tasty!!! \nA definite return is in order....... and Fathers Day is coming up!
"I think I'm about the only person who lived in Charlotte who is not a Cantina fan.  I've been there several times but I've always been disappointed.\n\nLikes:  It's a fun atmosphere, buzzing with energy.  The margaritas and guac are good if you're willing to pay up for them.\n\nDislikes:  So expensive, even when they're running \""specials\"" like about $18 for a pitcher of margaritas.  I had pork tacos one time: the food is sub-par and the quality is not great.  After that, I just got drinks there.  It's always packed, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.\n\nTake it or leave it:  Leave it.  It's trendy but majorly over-hyped and over-priced.  I would expect better quality from a \""fancy\"" Mexican place."
"Sold me an Air Filter for $38.54. I said it's too expensive. Answer: It is a great price, filters are so expensive. I'm look today in the Internet. $10.36. It's a scam!!!"
"I felt like I was cheating on America's Dairyland.\nNo Wisconsin cheese but hundreds, \nHUNDREDS you guys from around the world!\nAnd even though I'm lactose free I could appreciate the spectacular array of options and add-ons, quick things to grab for a lovely picnic or some charcute."
My food was just ok. Not exactly what I ordered. Asked for ham but got bacon. The service was very bad. I had to flag them down to fill up coffee and they acted as they were doing me a favor. But the coffee was good. I may give them another chance.
I used to love Mamma Mia's. No more.\n\nDO NOT order on-line unless you would like your money stolen. Ordered a pizza online a month ago. Pizza never showed. Called and they said their computer was down and didn't get any of their online orders. Really?! You run a business and can't get your orders off the computer!\n\nI said cancel my order and refund my $. They said a mgr would call me. He did and said they would refund my credit card charge. Never did. Called again. They said they would get right on it. Still no refund. Now having to dispute it with my credit card company. Always fun.\n\nRecent orders have been undercooked. Bummer. Looking for a new pizza place.
"Went to pick up lunch today, walked in and waited more than a few minutes before I even saw an employee. Finally placed an order, and the employee disappeared with my credit card to the back. Employee returned with the receipt to sign and it took several more minutes for my food.\n\nI got to my friend's house not far away, and despite the fact it had been less than 5 minutes, the fries were already cold and not that great. Baked beans had a weird flavor and were also kind of cold. Finally, the pulled pork sandwich was also underwhelming and cold. Sauce had way too much vinegar. Cole slaw looked disgusting, like it had been made several days before.\n\nThey probably still could have salvaged a second star, except that the customer service managed to drop even after I had left. I realized after I got home that when the employee disappeared with my credit card, she failed to bring it back. So I called, to verify that that's where I left it. I explained the situation to more than one employee and was repeatedly put on hold. They confirmed that she kept my card when she swiped it, but they refused to mail it back to me. Apparently they have a policy that they can only give it back to me if I come in, in person, and show ID. This place is across town, and there's no way I'm driving an hour round-trip to go pick up my card. I just don't see how this policy is anything but nonsense. Do they really think that someone else would figure out that my card was missing, and then be able to figure out where I left it before I do, and then intercept it, and then manage to make fraudulent charges? The whole thing is ridiculous. Not to mention that if they just had a credit card machine up in the front, where they take all of the takeout orders, this never would have happened.\n\nAll-in-all, I wish I would have passed, what started as a mediocre, over-priced lunch managed to turn into a real headache."
"All you need is LOVE!\n\nI am a huge fan of cirque du soleil shows and I'm an even huger fan of the beatles. I've been dying to watch this show since forever. To put it into context, I have watched totem, zumanity, ka, and Zarkana and this show blows all of them out of the water!\n\nThis theater definitely has one of the nicest lobbies and I really recommend you take photos here before the show starts because it gets crazy packed. The theater itself is small and intimate, I highly recommend the areas that are right across from the screens because they really set the mood. Also, every chair has a built in speaker so the music you hear is crisp to perfection.\n\nI was moved by every single act. From the moment I heard the iconic string strum in A hard day's night, I was hooked! I have to admit, being a huge beatles fan really helps because you can immerse yourself in the lyrics and the recognize the time period undertones. The show is very deep compared to the other shows and it tackles racism, the berlin wall, heart breaks, and world war 2. It's not the most acrobatic or jaw dropping show rather it's the most immersive show. \n\nIn order to not reveal spoilers, some of my favorite acts were Lucy in the sky, black bird, Something and Hey Jude. This show is a visual and audio overload, so much going on the stage at a time! Basically, I was grinning ear to ear through out the whole show. I had a really hard time getting beatlemania out of my head. :).\n\nOverall, hands down the best Cirque Du Soleil show I've ever watched!"
"If you like beer, broads and loud music, this place is for you. \n\nI am on a health kick so my food options were limited but my fried fish was soo soo okay. the potatoe salad was a little unlike the mexican picnic blend i grew up on but not bad. \n\nThe rowdyness of the place and the fact that nice looking broads go around swatting the patrons is cool and fun if you are into that kind of thing. \n\nMy friends did not say much about the sausage and stuff, but they sure seemed to like the beer. \n\nGreat fun - great atmosphere. \n\nHuge place for huge crowds and loud drinking folks!!"
My daughter and I ate sushi there last Friday night and came down with a terrible case of salmonella food poisoning!!!  This place needs to close ASAP!!!\n\nYOU risk your life if you EAT THERE!!!  BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Sweet Wife scouts for a cool restaurant on Yelp and announces, \""I want to go to Kotex\"".\n\n*Record scratching*\n\n\""Whaat?\""\n\n\n\nThere was only one waitress so she was pretty frantic but the tacos were amazing. Deliciously flavorful. And the torta was severed on a perfectly toasted bun. We got one taco in a lettuce wrap instead of a tortilla. That was a fresh, crispy little surprise. The nachos and burrito at the table next to us looked so good that I almost asked for a bite.\n\nWe've got a new must-go in Vegas.\n\nNow what was the name again? Tampax? Always?"
Fascinating!! Jaw dropping!
"I had the best burger in this place, it's awesome, the waiters there are so friendly, elegant atmosphere, great place and reasonable prices"
Took the family last night and there was a 20 min wait.  Waiter gave us the specials for the night and provided good service.  The portions are very large so go hungry. The onion straws were tasty and so are the sweet potato fries.  Extensive list of beers.  Prices are reasonable.  It is consistently voted one of the best in Charlotte.
"It had been awhile since we were last at a Jonny Rocket.   I like how sometimes a song comes on and the staff starts line dancing.  That is fun.  \n\nThis particular visit was not a good one.  The service at this location was absolutely terrible.  We waited like 30 mins for our food.  When it came to use my philly sandwich was cold.  The waiter brought us our drinks and never checked back on us.  We had to stop a different server and ask them to take care of us.   When we actually did see our server he had no personality. At least our table was not important to him.  \n\nNow to get fries and a drink added to your sandwich is $4.50?  Really?  The food is not that good here as it is and then you are going to toss and outrageous price like that out?  We had a 4 year old with us and ordered him a cheeseburger off the kids menu and they charged $1 for a piece of cheese?\n\n\nThe service alone will keep me from returning to this location,  but these ridiculous prices will keep me from returning to any Jonny Rocket location.  $45 for a kids meal, 3 burgers, 3 fries, and 3 drinks?  Craziness.  \n\nFor that price Five Guys is a much better option.  If you want sub par food similar to Jonny Rockets but at a much cheaper price then head to Denny's."
"Good lord, the Chinese food here is totally dumbed down American style because it tastes nothing like Chinese! I swear their Kon Pao Chicken pass off as dog. The only thing I dug was the atmosphere for it's supposed to be tip top classy."
"Ugh. How do you spell DEPRESSING? Well, you abbreviate it, anyway, with the letters: T.I. as it's called on the strip.\n\nDon't go here. It's gross. Everyone's a slobbering mess. \n\nThe dealer tried to take my bet in blackjack. That shit was a push. She realized her mistake and tried to pretend nothing happened. Wow.\n\nIf these were the golden days of vegas, I know just how I woulda dealt with her...A nice knuckle sandwich in the \""back room.\"""
"It isn't that I didn't enjoy my food and the service.  It just didn't live up to my experience at other Joe's I've been to.  I have been to Joe's in two other cities and had better, more memorable experiences.  \n\nTo some extent, we felt rushed.  Only a few minutes after taking our drink order, the server came back three times asking if we were ready to order.  I felt pressured to make a choice.  The drinks and appetizers came out very quickly as did our main meal.  Too quickly.  We had barely dug into the appetizers when the entrees were brought out.  Usually this isn't that big an issue, but when you are having one of the hot pots, you basically have to start eating it right away (because who likes cold crab legs or clams?).  We were there on a Saturday night, so perhaps they are set up so they can have a quick turn around and get a lot of people through with minimal wait times, but I personally like to take time to savor my meals.  \n\nIf you like food with a kick, I highly recommend the \""great balls of fire\"" appetizer.  Filled with flavor, but with just the right amount of spice to not kill your tastebuds.\n\nFor an entree, I had the Joe's Classic steam pot.  It was tasty, but didn't seem as flavorful as I had expected.  My dining companion had chicken tenders and he thought they were very tasty.  It is nice that they have options like steak and chicken tenders at a restaurant that focuses on seafood.  Many similiar locations have far fewer options.\n\nOverall, food was decent and service was OK.  There are just a lot more restaurants that I'd prefer to visit again (or for the first time) before I'll come back to Joe's."
"I don't think I've ever had a worst breakfast. I had the Mexican Scramble. It was nothing more than a pile of near raw potatoes with s small amount of tasteless chorizo on top. I had 2 biscuits on the side, that were not cooked in the center. My wife had the chicken fried steak and potatoes... same thing . A thin tasteless chicken patty laid atop a huge pile of near raw potatoes. This is the second time leaving a post/review because the first one somehow magically disappeared. I also posted pictures but they too are gone. There were lots of people waiting outside for tables. There are so many good reviews for this place, so i don't understand my experience. I guess some people really have no idea what good food taste like. @hoosiercafe #hoosiercafe"
"These guys were great.  They were prompt, even though it's quite a trip to get to my house, polite, and reasonably priced.  Everything I'm looking for in a plumber."
"This was actually the first of many venues visited by myself and my fiance (now husband) for our wedding ceremony.  The photos online look amazing, and we were anxious to visit the property.  We called and made an appointment, and arrived a couple of minutes early.  We stood in front of the open door of the office for nearly 20 minutes, all the while the two employees inside (who could clearly see us) joked and laughed.  We finally stepped out back to take a tour ourselves.  \n\nWe were not nearly as impressed as we thought we would be.  The place is in need of major repairs, and the attention to detail just isn't there.  The windows looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in a very long time, as they were coated with smears, fingerprints, goop-like substances, and a layer of the desert's dust.  The floor of the main ball room was absolutely disgusting, and the women's and men's bathrooms smelled HORRIBLE (seriously, they smelled like a well-used Port-A-Potty after midnight at an all-you-can-eat deep-fried sausage event).  \n\nWe were just about to walk out the door when one of the two employees who had been jibber-jabbering in the office came to stop us.  When we told her that it was over 30 minutes past our appointment time and we needed to get going, she inquired as to why we just didn't come into her office and sit down.  Really?  So it's our fault that we didn't begin the meeting on time?  We told her that the place just didn't look how we expected it to look. She remarked that they had had a big event the weekend before, and that the place still hadn't been cleaned.  That might be true, but there were things that looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months!  \n\nFurther, the \""castle\"" is situated in an industrial area which is currently under construction.  If you're planning an event that does not take place in the evening, construction noise is a very real possibility."
"Blossom is a gorgeous restaurant, with a Chinese modern decor featuring black lacquered tables, very comfortable booths with long and plush rose-hued cushions that provide great back support, and green and orange accents on the seats of small carved Chinese throne chairs and hanging table lamps that look like bottomless bird cages. Flowers and candles at the entrance, and additional flowers on dining table tops as well as some dishes, along with soothing music, just added to the relaxing ambiance. My party of four remained dining in this leisurely comfort for a solid 2-3/4 hours. This long sojourn at the restaurant also helped us amortize the high prices for food items over a longer period of time, which, based on other Yelp reviews, we knew we would face going in. And, yes, the superior quality of the cuisine and service was worth the cost. \n\nWe opened with an order of 5 nicely-sized pan-fried Pot Stickers Our server called them medium, but they looked large to me. The outer dough was perfectly cooked as a Pot Sticker can be. But the pork on the inside was unusually dense, and almost devoid of any vegetables, which was just a bit off-putting to me. But I made do dressing up the Pot Stickers with a large array of sauces, oil, and other accessories that I had requested. Everything I asked for I received: besides regular soy sauce a thin soy-based sauce, a thick Hoisin-based sauce, XO sauce, a rich and plum-colored Sweet & Sour sauce, Chinese Chili Oil, and matchsticks of fresh ginger. Fashioning varying combinations was fun before inserting large bites in my mouth. But what was even more enjoyable was savoring the very fine, well-assembled Lettuce Wraps that were topped by wonderfully tasty, small boiled shrimps, several of which cascaded down the front of my dress shirt before I noticed. I hardly cared, for the shrimps were bathed in a light and delicate glistening dressing, which washed right off with water. I only regretted that a few tasty crustaceans had eluded me. \n\nNext was a small bowl of Hot & Sour Soup. Spicy and delicious! As was my tablemates' Wor Won Ton Soup that I sampled, which  featured a delicate clear broth, large scallop, one giant shrimp, an interesting to behold clear and flexible bundle of glass noodles, and two beautiful filled won tons. \n\nFor entrees we enjoyed tender, medium-rare pan-fried Beef Tenderloin with Chinese Black Mushrooms in a light brown sauce, which was modified to our taste from the menu offering of pan-fried Beef Tenderloin with Portobello Mushrooms in a Black Pepper Sauce; Hong Kong Style Chow Mein with large scallops and prawns; large Garlic Prawn Fried Rice, and gigantic Walnut Prawns glazed by mayonnaise, accompanied by slightly sticky Steamed Rice. Everything was delicious, if a little bland. But I had the sauces to give the repast before me a greater kick whenever I so desired. The only problem was that as the night wore on, understandably the warmth of the Tenderloin began to ebb. So, I deliberately sought to gobble up this dish as fast as I could. Pots of addictive, very tasty hot Jasmine Tea that were repeatedly re-poured into ceramic cups and regularly replenished by our servers washed everything down. Portions were large and more than adequate; we took a few leftovers home. \n\nNot to close such a fine meal too abruptly, we finished the evening gorging on very rich Chocolate Ginger, composed of chocolate-ginger pudding, chocolate mousse, a dark chocolate glaze, a few ground nuts, and a topping of white chocolate orange ice cream supporting a fragile and finely constructed circle of chocolate ribbon, IN ADDITION TO a trio of Mango, Red Bean, and Green Tea Japanese Mochi resting on sleek green leaves accompanied by two half-strawberries and a red carnation. The waitstaff were friendly and as accommodating as I have encountered in any restaurant.  The only error in service delivery that occurred all night was our principal server forgetting to provide separate checks as requested at the time of our initial order, a slight oversight that was promptly remedied.  \n\nWhat is there not to like at Blossom? I highly recommend this fine dining establishment to all gourmands!"
"I strongly recommend the Farm Fries, a basket of thin-cut (McDonald's style) fries bathed in gravy (turkey?) and melted yellow shredded cheese. The richness of the gravy was on point and not overwhelming. It was a savory, calorie-laden treat. \nI read a review that the Gobbler was right up there with a Bobbie (my most favorite sandwich). After having one on this visit, I must disagree. The hunk of fried turkey was cooked well. Did I enjoy the flavor? Not really. I didn't detect any seasoning in the batter. The bun was smaller than I expected for a $5.99 price tag. I also fail to see the point of not dressing the sandwich. The cranberry and Miracle Whip would be better served on the Gobbler rather than in packets on the side. \nFarm Basket, I gave you a whirl, I enjoyed your fries but I'm sticking with Capriotti's for my turkey sandwiches."
"It's a pity so many people have had such bad experiences at B&B. We visited on 3/23 and had a fantastic experience! We were running late for our 8 p.m. reservation that evening and called ahead to let them know we would be 10-15 minutes late. We actually arrived closer to 25 minutes late but the hostess was very gracious and told us that it was not a problem. We were seated immediately and our waitress was right over to take our drink orders. Before perusing the menu, our waitress let us know that we could ask her any questions we had about any of the plates as their menu is not very descriptive. We ordered two appetizers, Burrata (and I can't remember the other one), the Burrata was outstanding! \n\nAfter that we chose our pasta dishes, I had the Gnocchi with lamb ragu. I have never had lamb before and this was a perfect introduction. Overall the food was very good, not the best I've ever had but delicious none the less.\n\nWhat really stood out to us was the service. Our waitress and the rest of the wait staff were super attentive and always available to fulfill any request. \n\nWill be returning on future trips!"
Filiberto food with high restaurant prices. Tried it once before and thought maybe I got something bad. But I was wrong. This is just average mexican good posing as fine food. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Mexican food. I would recommend restaurant Mexico on mill if you want great Mexican food that doesn't try to church up it's prices
"Lavo nightclub is the spot on Sundays. especially when there's VICE. Cant get any better. free cover for guys and girls on gl, girls have open bar until midnight. confetti, glow sticks, foam, great music, madness!\n\ntotal cost spent between my friends and I: $11 (tipping for drinks)."
"Came here for lunch with my family friends about 17 of us.  Great value for the price.  A variety of Filipino dishes and all tasted excellent.  Had the dinuguan, Kare Kare, sinagang,  beef steak, tocino, beef mechado, pork adobo, and a few others.  Definitely will be going here next time I'm in Vegas again."
"Compared to other spring training facilities and minor league ballparks, color me unimpressed. \n\nWhat is does have: \n- The outfield grass is the place to be. We roamed around to find the best spots and this seemed the most relaxing. Not too hot, and not too cold.\n- We liked the fact that the ushers didn't really care where you sit. If you wanted to sit behind home plate, nobody will stop you.\n- ample seating. Wasn't crowded when we went.\n- It's still spring training, which you can't bitch about.\n- easy parking.\n\nWhat it lacks:\n- Atmosphere! This place is quieter than a library! You could seriously hear a pin drop. Was it apathetic Angels fans? I don't know. But they only played music when there was a pitching change and even then it seemed like an afterthought. It was very surreal to go to a quiet game where nobody seemed to be really interested. I know it's spring training, but come on?\n- A decent view. You can see the freeway and a University of Phoenix building in right field. Whoop de doo! The left field had a cool view of a mesa however. \n- Decent food. It has ballpark fare and nothing else. It has nothing to write home about. The italian ice in the outfield was a welcome treat."
"Avenue Q was brilliant.  Keep in mind, however, that Avenue Q comes with a traveling cast.\n\nThe Gammage Auditorium itself?  Not impressed.\n\nFrom the outside, yes, it looks really cool. Some of the lights are out, but over all, it looks really cool from the outside.\n\nInside? It's a bit outdated. The bathrooms are gross, and half of the floors are completely handicap inaccessible. Of course, they don't tell you this when you get your tickets.  We showed up, and asked where the elevator was. Rudely, we were told there wasn't one, and if I had wanted accessible seats, I should have bought full priced orchestra ones.  I walk slowly and with a cane, and while I can handle a few stairs when I must, the 2.5 flights of stairs nearly killed me on the way up, and then I didn't go to the restrooms when I wanted too at intermission, because there was no way in hell I would have walked back up there.  I almost burst into tears as it was.\n\nI then had to rinse and repeat to get down at the end.  Again, multiple flights of stairs, people pushing me, and rude ushers chiding me for not buying outrageously priced orchestra tickets which were accessible.  Way to be classist AND ableist at the same time.\n\nFunny, isn't it, that such a tongue in cheek commentary on discrimination should be held at a place that both architecturally AND verbally discriminates?"
"The fry bread is good, but it is overpriced and the service is Horrible!  The fact that they gave a Giant Tip jar is hilarious, since they just take your money and call out your name when it's ready.   I guess you're tipping for the indifferent service that is border line rude and obnoxious.  Won't be going back."
"So I responded via email per request to the CSR rep below and she was concerned and courteous.  I emailed her maybe twice and another corporate rep also emailed with concern and humor.  I was then told that the local district manager would be contacting me within the week.  That was a few weeks ago.  I am really over a bad customer experience a month ago, but it is a shame the disconnect between local and corporate.  I need no further contact from dsw, but did feel the need to update the review."
"The Bagel Cafe has to be one of the best breakfast (and lunch) spots in Vegas. It has character, they make their customers feel like family and the food is amazing. One of the things I feel like many Las Vegans complain about is the lack of these types of family owned restaurants. Since this is right by my house, I eat there almost 2-3 times per month.\n\nIt is perfect for takeout or sit-in, they also have a huge selections of desserts, which are perfect if you just want a little something to crave your sweet tooth or you are looking for a full on cake to bring to a party.\n\nFor breakfast I am hooked on the veggie omelet, with sliced tomatoes and an everything bagel. (The lite scallion cream cheese is my weakness!) \n\nThey actually have good strong house coffee too!\n\nFor lunch their fresh tuna and egg salad sandwiches are so good and HUGE!\n\nOne of things that continues to draw me into this place is that unlike most breakfast places you don't feel like you are consuming a thousand calories! Their food tastes fresh and healthy! Of course if you get Biscuits and Gravy or something like that you are probably looking at a boat load of calories/fat, but overall I don't feel like they cover their food in butter or grease."
"I love tapas, and i was excited to finally try Johnny Smalls. The restaurant was packed but not too noisy, we were able to talk comfortably.\nThe best deal is to sign up for a players card or if you already have one, even better. Tell your waitress if you order the AYCE deal and you'll get $5 off for you and your companion.\nWhat we tried...my favorite was the Small Balls (YUM!!!),   Caprese salad was small but full of flavor,   Crab and Artichoke Dip was cheesy and delicious,   Grilled PB&J with apricot jam was sweet and tasty,    Mighty Balls were good, traditional meatballs,     Asada Tacos were good but nothing special,     Cow Pie Sliders were good, lots of taste,     So Beefy Sliders were good, but needed more meat on them,       The Lobster Pillow Puffs we hated, so we sent them back, they tasted doughy, the sauce had no flavor,      The Finger chicken on a stick was good, dip they serve along side is delish,    Tuna tartare quesadillas were good, but it was a big portion, so be sure you have someone to share it with,      Meat Lover flat bread was okay, the guys liked it, I didn't like the sauce on it, it was peppery and smokey.\nEven though the desserts sounded yummy we were stuffed and had to pass. Service was good throughout. I can't wait to go back."
My family and I stayed at Tahiti Village on New Years Eve weekend.  At first glance it looked just like your ordinary Holiday Inn hotel but when you get to the inside it was just as you expected from the name of the resort.  We had the two bedroom suite with the full size kitchens.  My family and I were really impressed with what we were accommodated with.  The lazy river on site was really warm being that we were there during the Christmas holidays.   At this thought I would recommend Tahiti Village to anyone who would like to have a home away from home experience.
"This may be my favorite week night restaurant. The olive appetizer is my favorite, and the best olives I've had in my life. Ever. I get the sandwich with roast beef, muenster cheese and horseradish pretty regularly and cannot eat it fast enough it's so good! They also have great craft beers on tap!"
"Pizza was ok at best. I needed a receipt for my travel expenses and called, but they told me the greasy, no name \""receipt\"" attached to the box was all they had. I asked for a breakdown of the charges and the guy told me to \""figure it out\"" and was rushing me off the phone. He said I could go to the store and pick up the receipt. I was 2+ miles away and therefore I had it delivered. I asked to speak to th manager but was told he wasn't around. I couldn't believe the guy's attitude."
"The room was not clean by the time we cheeked in and we had to wait for someone to come and prepare it for us. The price is the only thing which is convenient to go for and nothing else. no service because the thousands of people at the entrance, but the fast chek in machines helps you to speed up the queue."
"A cheese plate featuring 100% water buffalo cheese, elk chops, and the cayenne pepper triple chocolate cheese made for one of the best and most unique Charlotte meals I have ever had. My only criticism, however minor, is the music: \""It's Beginning to Look a lot like Christmas\"" and \""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\"" played on a loop can get absolutely maddening through the course of a one hour dinner service. That should not deter you though as The Fig Tree is now in my Charlotte Top 3."
Called around and no one could beat this places offer. Quick service and phone looks like brand new. Will go again if I have too (hope I don't have to). They have my business going forward with my products. Thanks and keep it up.
"I fly into Vegas once a year to make a trip to Utah to visit friends.  I rent a car each time but this was my first experience with Dollar and will probably be my last.  Yes, they came in the low end with the rates but still I was under the impression most rental cars were 'new'.   The car I had was 2 years old and the filthiest rental car, I've ever had.  The seats and steering wheels were sticky with soda spills.  The car also had a strange odor.  But worse, a couple of times along my trip the car sputtered but seemed to run ok.  I told the guy when I turned the car in about the sputtering but he seemed unconcerned.  The rental wound up costing twice the price quoted due to all the added fees and a mandatory insurance but that seems to be the case no matter what rental agency I use."
"Love Ruby!  I actually remember going to the old location as a kid - and how great it was then.  Same quality and service today.\n\nFUN TIP:  Make sure to check out the water fountain, too.  See if you can get it to work.  Pretty cool."
"Definitely didn't love this bar. My boyfriend and I went there for lunch. Location was great in the Harrah's casino, but that's honestly the only thing that I can say was great. The waitress was friendly, and recommended a few items from the menu. I ordered her #1 choice of a fried bologna sandwich with french fries. The sandwich was completely saturated in grease. It's a grilled sandwich so I expected it to have some grease, but this was absurd. I ate about three bites. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips and it, too was covered in so much grease it was not edible. Needless to say we paid a hefty price for heartburn and stomach aches for the rest of the day. We will not be returning. If I had to recommend one thing, it would be to save your money and eat at the deli in Harrah's."
"went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \""lobster tails\"" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore."
"I have to agree with Patti B. that this location pretty much sucks.  The service is just ok - they are far from friendly.  I've been in  a couple of times to pick up food and I have yet to be impressed.  I wanted to give them another chance tonight and I should not have bothered.  The food is not so good.  I'd rather go to Pita Jungle or Thai Llana any day!  The spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty.  I had some kind of udon noodle dish and threw most of it in the garbage.  Use your 'free entree' coupon to save $$ one night, but that's about it... I will not be returning to (this) Pei Wei any time soon..."
"Good ribs, amazing hot links and service with a smile!"
Needed to have my phone repaired today...checked in at 3:30...wasn't helped until 5:03.  This is the same case scenario everytime I have to go in...which is a lot because my phone blows!!!  :/
"I did a lot of research before booking this hotel.  All the photos on the websites only display the \""newer\"" rooms.  When we booked it we were looking forward to staying at a nice hotel with a great location.  It was a great location but not a nice hotel. It was my first time in Vegas and I was looking forward to everything going as planned. Turns out it was an extra $30/night to upgrade to a \""newer\"" room. I was very disappointed.  There always has to be something wrong or a catch when we book things online these days.  We did not want to spend any more money on upgrades so decided not to.  The room was clean looking but not really clean.  The website said it would come with many amenities.... but it came with only the basics: soap, shampoo, iron, blow dryer and tv.  No coffee machine or anything else! The carpet was stained and dirty.. i was afraid to go barefoot.  The bathroom was big and clean but the shower curtain was annoying.  The bed was king size and uncomfortable.  Nothing special about the sheets either. I was afraid of bed bugs... our room was far from the elevators but that was expected due to the huge hotel.  The hotel food was horrible.  I rather eat at Mc D's than the burger joint.  The pizza place was decent when the made it fresh.  And there was a scent/odor by the salon spa and store area... I don't know what it was but it made me nausea everytime we walked by to go to the garage. Almost like a wax smell.  Gross.  I don't know if I would stay here again unless I have one of the upgraded rooms.  I am usually not that picky but I do have bad allergies and sinus problems."
"I went in for the lunch buffet and I will never return.  There are better buffets with greater selections around the same price.  The selection here was limited compared to other chinese buffets I have been to, and what they did have was low quality and low on taste.  The pork was chewy and seemed old, I spit it out after taking a bite.  I don't know how one makes teriyaki chicken taste bad, but they were sure successful here because the sause was greasy and the chicken chewy (probably low quality meat).  The sweet and sour sauce tasted weird, and the hot mustard was not hot and seemed watery.  I only ate some of the chow mein and fried rice, both of which wasn't great either.  \n\nI am not quite sure how this place is in business, with the quality of the food.   I did not try any dinner menu items - so I will withhold judgment, though I will never return to find out for sure."
"Excellent sushi, great service, and good happy hour specials.  It has a decent sports bar theme.  I had my bachelor party here and even my friends who don't care for fish liked the place.  I also go here for business dinners.\n\nTry the Ladybug Roll just for the presentation."
"this was a great show, Although do NOT watch \""cirque du soleil wolds apart\"" on netfilx first or you will see 2/3 of the show. I made that mistake so I knew what was going to happen, but to see it in person was a totally different thing. Also front row seats are not the best seats, try to sit 3-4 rows back. I sat in the front row and it was cool to have some of the performers walk right up to you and to see their facial expressions but the view could get obstructed at times and  some aerial things were just hard to see being so close...I was more looking up than forward sometimes. \n\nFinally nobody explains this but there is a fake usher that roams around and throws popcorn and or water on you. If you get shown to your seat and a bright spotlight is on you, sh*t's about to go down..."
Time after time this store continues to disappoint. I needed a pair of shorts so I decided to try this store again. I had great customer service last week and it gave me hope that this store had turned around. I return this week only to find that the customer is not priority here. I will go back to shopping online.
"Classy and beautiful with pretty girls, pools, and poles \n\nI'd recommend bottle service here for convenience"
Waited 2 hours for a salad and a sandwich when it arrived my salad was soggy and hot look like cooked greens my sandwich was cold and my fried were cold. I call to speak with the manager he was not there the guy on the phone gets an attitude and says he will give me a $5 credit toward another meal when I didn't agree he got mad said the driver would bring me back my money and told me to fuck off. I will be up there when I get off work to go off cause I still have received my money back... smh
"I take the light rail into work every day, and have been wanting to stop at Sami's Gyros for a while now.  I finally got to!  yay!\n\nAnyways, I was on my way downtown to the baseball game and was starving.  I had busy Saturday morning, and didnt have time to stop beforehand to get some food.  So, I boarded the light rail early and decided to stop at Sami's to try it out.  I was glad I did.\n\nThis place was great.  They have a great menu, and prices are reasonable.  It was rather quiet on a Saturday afternoon, but I was also in there at 3:30 and they close at 4 on Saturdays, so most people had either already eaten.\n\nI got a Gyro, Greek salad and coke.  I think it cost me about $8.50, and it was more then enough for me.   Great serving size, I felt like I got what I paid for here, serving wise.  \n\nBUT, there were a few things on the Gyro that I noticed. I dont know if it was because I was there so close to closing time, or if this is the way that it always is, but the meat seemed a little dry to me.  I won't hold it against them, but it was probably becuase I was there so late.  Also, I wished they had put a little more of the sauce on the gyro.  I felt like that it was just not enough for me. \n\nI also like this place beause its right off the light rail at the Priest and Washington stop.  Easy on, easy off.  I do recomend this place.  The service was good and I enjoyed my time here."
Best AYCE sushi i have had ever! I used to live in Vegas and ate here all the time. Now I live in LA and no AYCE compares. Midori on ventura blvd? Hell naw that place doesnt stand a chance against Brians Beach.\nI've been to Japan about 15 times in my life so please dont question my judgement on sushi. This place is no Asanebo but for AYCE it gets no better. While in Vegas go to Brians Beach.
"We arrived around 10pm after a long drive, checked in, but I alone lugged all of the bags to the room, while my girlfriend ran an errand, only to find it messed up and not clean. The bed was all torn up, towels all over the floor, trash in the trash cans, iron out, completely disheveled. So I called and was told to return to registration for a new room, meaning that I had to lug the bags all the way back to the registration desk. I was given a new room alright, but no apology, nothing. In fact, both the worker on the phone and the registration clerk acted like this was a perfectly normal situation. Too tired to jump to a different hotel tonight, but we cancelled our remaining days and moved to a different hotel in the morning--even paying extra for an early check-in. This was my first and last stay at SouthPoint, and I refrained from gambling or spending any additional $$ in the restaurants. I don't know about you, but it feels really gross to walk into someone else's unclean hotel room when you are expecting a nice clean squared away typical hotel experience."
There was 6 of us and we decided to grab lunch here.  The food was decent. Besides the fact of only having been served meat 4 times in 2 hours. When we asked to split the check 3 ways the server didn't split it. We asked again if we can split it again and the server said we couldn't. After talking to the manager they split 6 ways. When we finally got everything situated the server didn't bring back change in one of the bills. Absolute HORRIBLE SERVE. Next time I'd rather spend the extra money to go somewhere else where service is their first priority. We didn't even get offered dessert.
"It's a great no nonsense gym. It has free weights, machines, cardio and tanning. Staff is quite friendly and the clientele are regular people. The few times I've been there it hasn't been packed. I worked with the trainer Dom for a free session on rehabbing my shoulder. He was knowledgeable, motivated and just generally on top of his game. All in all its a good gym for the price...15 down 15 a month no contract...24 hrs weekdays and 7-7 weekends...just can't go wrong with this place."
What a local gem! I was so happy that my path led me right to this Tavern. Something about it caught my eye as I was sightseeing in Madison and I am so glad it did. I sat at the window looking out onto the Capitol grounds as I ate the most delicious pork sandwich and homemade potato chips. The deconstructed presentation of the sandwich may have been what made this dish work so well. The perfect blend of tangy and sweet. I'm a fan! Too bad I was only in Madison for a few hours!
Our favorite local steakhouse. Went on Friday night to celebrate my husbands birthday. Adam the manager took great care of us and the food was great.
"I have been here probably at least 4x over the past year. I have never had a bad experience yet.  Last night my Aunt was in town visiting.  She was staying on the strip at Treasure Island so we decided to grab some sushi at the Palazzo. \n\nThe Otsunami appetizer of edamame, crispy green beans and green peppers is really good! It was the first time I had sea bass skewers based on other yelp reviews and they did not disappoint! For sushi we had Bobo Brazil roll with is kobe beef, the sushi samba roll with the lobster claw and the Lima roll with Spicy King Crab mix. Also if you want a good cocktail the Samba juice is really good!\n\nThey have a busy bar area to have some drinks, a nice sushi bar and a very lively atmosphere inside the restaurant. \n\nThe only downside if i had to give one is the rolls are relatively small for the price. However the quality is high! I would recommend checking it out if you are in the area."
"Dude something has happened to this place in recent months, the quality is not what it used to be, the service is not what it used to.  I don't know if they had a change in management or what cause me and my wife used to go here ALL the time for the All You Can Drink Saki and Beer and All You Can Eat.  We don't go here anymore cause the qualify just went and crapped out on us.  Go to Sushi Bomb down the street"
This place is a joke.   I Call them they tell me they have a special two pizzas14.99 and I order it. They bring it and delivery guy says  29.99.  I tell delivery guy about their  price quote  and he calls his boss.. Boss says their price is correct.  I talk to owner she argues and tells me that the price is 29.99..i mean I'm not lying lol... I felt bad for driver but told him to take pizzas and leave.   Also they said 45 minutes and it took 1 hr 15 minutes.. This place is literally a joke of an establishment
"I received the worst service I have ever gotten at this Steve Madden location. The shop was bustling as I went over the Labor Day weekend, however the girls who were working did NOTHING to help. I sat around for a while before I asked a girl who was playing on the computer if she could get me a pair of shoes from the back. She looked up at me and told me they were soldout without moving a foot from where she was standing. I asked if she could get them online, and she said there were no more on the website. Since she didn't even take a second to check whether or not there were anymore shoes either instore or on the website, I checked myself that night when I got home. Needless to say, there was plenty in stock and the shoes I was looking for was under the \""bestseller\"" category. I cannot believe how rude the sales assistant was and I will not be coming back again."
"I wanted something light when I went here with friends recently so I ordered the fruit plate. This fruit plate was GINORMOUS -- nice!  It seriously lasted me for a few days. Besides giving a thumbs up on the portions of my meal, our server was really friendly. Next time I go I'm definitely gonna go for protein pancakes."
"Good wine selection but the dude named Paul asked me if I need wine glasses or am I going to drink it out of the bottle.  Hu!  I have wine glasses thank you.  Rudeness tells me why he hates working here unless it's a bad joke, probably but still inappropriate."
I loved this place. They let me hold a chicken!!! There were soooo many animals!!! I was in heaven.  The fudge was amazing.  The people were super nice.  Can't wait to take my grandnieces next Thursday.
"I'm never disappointed when I eat at a Wildflower.  It's a better version of Paradise Bakery with a feel free to stay all day if you like (but less pretentious) Starbucks vibe.  I also dig that one of the founders of the company emailed me to address some of my critiques of another location, even though the review was generally positive.  It's great to see that they're paying attention to their customers.\n\nThere's a great selection of sandwiches, salads and baked goods.  For the sandwiches I think the secret is in the simplicity and quality.  Most of them don't have more than three or four ingredients, but they seem to put together the perfect combination between those two slices of fresh baked bread.  My wife's caesar salad may have been one of the tastiest caesar salads I've ever tried.\n\nThis location also has a few cool things going for it.  There are power outlets under many of the booths, making it convenient for computer and tablet users to do whatever they are doing as they enjoy their drinks and meals.  Like other locations, there's the standard lounge near the front of the restaurant that's a perfect place for waiting for take out orders, or for coffee drinkers to hang out in a more open setting.  And this Wildflower also has a private party room in the back, which is also nice if you have a big group.\n\nIf you're anywhere nearby, Wildflower Bread Company is certainly worth a try."
Tried Archies cafe for the first time. The service was great and the food was the best Tai food I've had so far. I ordered the Pad Tai 6 on the spicey scale and it could have been a little hotter. It is a great atmosphere and overall a great restaurant.
"Slices Pizza is pretty good, not the best though. But if you are on Mill Ave its the best Pizza option.  Uno's is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in Phoenix.  If the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars.  If you are in Tempe a much better Pizza place is Red Devil Pizza about 5 minutes South."
"\""Must be born on or before today's date, 1991, to purchase alcohol\"" \n\nWELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLl what do you know about that. APRIL FOOLS BABY I'M THE 21 and YOU WILL SERVE ME WELL! \n\nHaha, they're pretty good about checking your ID, so make sure you have that handy, so you can get started on your Fat Tuesday on Sunday morning!! It was pretty short of amazing. Take your pick on cups and get started because once you have the cup, you can just keep coming back for more! \n\nMy all time favorite is the 44 Magnum (190 Octane & Hurricane). A mixture of Orange Juice and Vodka-190 O and the Hurr- is a Strawberry and Rum Daiquiri. Noms, you really feel it in the slushy. You're all thinking that it's cute like something you get from Seven-11, but really it's absolutely delicious and wonderful, especially in that Las Vegas heat! There's a list of most enjoyed mixes, or you can create your own! For a dollar, it's an extra shot in your drink in a test tube. It's cute and a tad bit hard to get the vodka out, so I just waited until I was at the end of my daiquiri before unleashing that shot! \n\nIt's at a continent location, in Mandalay Bay by shopping and hotels and casinos and they take cups and do refills from anywhere. It's the only Fat Tuesday in that general area, since the rest are Evening Call, but it's worth it and the prices are usually under 20$. The refills are like 11$ and under, so not bad not bad. Like a mini alcoholic slushy paying mini bar.\n\nI will be back. And you should come try, especially if you're thirsty.  \n(PS. I wasn't hurting the next time, even with the shots. I probably needed even more!)\nNot to mention, since it is Vegas, they take pretty much most forms of payment in terms of cards and cash!"
"Inexpensive compared to other lunch options in the area. Cafeteria style service. You grab a tray and tell them what you want. They pass your plate to the next station. Then wait in line to pay. \n\nThe don't skimp on servings. I was going to pass on the cornbread and glad I didn't. It was absolute fire! (That means it was delicious) The baked chicken was tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes and gravy right on point. Dirty rice was good too. \n\nI will be back here when I'm hankering for a carb overdose. Don't go there starved, unless you can care less about overeating or spending a few more dollars for extra sides. \n\nGreat place to have lunch with friends. Open and spacious but seating limited during the lunch rush. Outside seating is an option too. Just know that it's crazy during lunch but they manage it well. Very friendly staff to boot.\n\nEnjoy!"
"We have been dining here for over one year and heartily recommend the venue!  The experience begins with smiles and greetings when you enter!  The wait staff truly aim to please!  We have had exemplary service from Judy, Sandra and Fabi...!  The chef always provides excellent, tasty meals!  Also, he will make French fries topped with green salsa and cheese! Must comment on the cleanliness of the entire restaurant and bar!  We think Baja Joe's does not have an equal in the east valley; so, we find ourselves dining there several times per week!"
No bueno!! I dont recommend this place. Its no where near authenic mexican food.
"Stop. I like this place. I don't want to hear that this place is some generic watered down Japanese food restaurant or something.  I don't think this place was made to be authentic.  It's catering to a broader audience or to first timers who want to get their feet wet with some Asian food, or people who  just want that quick Asian food fix  without the full menu experience  I've had the chicken, beef, pork, and katsu plates. Their house dressing for their salad is unique like a sweet vinegerette. Their gyoza and shrimp tempura is just like what you'll find in any Japanese restaurant.  The food is flavorful and made from scratch and made to order. Sizable portions that are satisfyijng to your belly. Service is quick and courteous. It's great fast food without the grease and the short order cook with a spatula banging on the bell yelling \""Order up!\"""
"This place is TOP!! \n\nAs you walk in, they ask if you are first timer or not. If you are a first timer then they will explain to you how to order and also like many others, I have coupon from Groupon. And they would as you that as well. Just so they can explain to you what is to order if you have Groupon. \n\nThe girls and guys that worked there are so energetic, nice, helpful and as a plus they smile to you. \n\nI order the Alexa which is strawberry waffles, with strawberry ice cream, top with fresh sweet strawberries and a whip cream. I assumed they say no substitute but I ask anyway if I can have chocolate ice cream instead of the strawberry ice cream. And he said \""no problem\"" ... well you win there.. \n\nThe waffles is really good, I usually can not finish 1 average size waffles. But this one, as you can see in the picture I post ~ its clean.. too bad the waffles was served in a paper plate. Or else I would clean the plate. \n\nIf I live in the area, I will have my breakfast there often. \nBut if I ever go to Las Vegas again, I will definitely go back to WaffleS Cafe."
"I loved the decor, very hip, and the presentation of the food was gorgeous.  The food was pretty good, not mind-blowing, but inventive and fresh.  I really liked the looks of the menu.  It offers a lot of diversity and good salad options which you rarely see in Vegas.  I would say it is slightly over-priced, but not so much you feel totally used afterwards.  The bartender was excellent, made every drink for our party exactly as they ordered it.  He made me a Hot Toddy for my sore throat.  I was a very happy girl.  This place is a good place for groups and the service was really on spot."
"My first car was a Subaru.  I have had many Subies over the years and am quite happy with this Subaru dealership in town (owned by the Findlay family).  They have treated me like family and I have never had any problems and complaints with their parts and service departments.  The staff here is always accommodating.  I especially like their complimentary beverage counter where you can make your own gourmet coffee, tea or partake in their slushies.  This dealership is well maintained and of course would recommend a Subaru to anyone.  Maybe I'm just a little bias..\n\nOn another note, I am sorry to see that Zenkai has finally closed its door in Vegas.\nhttp://www.zenkaimotorsports.com/"
"I was really impressed with this hotel on my recent trip to Vegas for a girls weekend. The hotel itself is very impressive, the decor is amazing and so well thought out. The hotel is fairly new so doesn't have that haggard look but actually they've kept it up well. The casino is open and airy (not smokey at all) and somehow doesn't feel as claustrophobic as other casinos in Vegas. The rooms are great! Very modern with mirrors everywhere and clean lines. Remote control drapes and sheers as well as lights. We stayed in a king suite so had the benefit of a separate living room with a couch. It was nice to be able to have a pregame cocktail without having to sit on a bed. The bathroom was gorgeous, double sinks, large tub, shower with two heads and lots of nice bath products (although the shampoo and conditioner could be upgraded). I laughed when I read another reviewers comment about the toilet being too high, I felt the same way! Like a little kid with my legs dangling! The toilet is a little aggressive too when you flush, but who's complaining?? The pools are nice. They have options, you can go to the family pool or the \""European\"" pool (bikini tops optional). You can also use pools at Wynn. The younger crowd pools are fun with pumping music and hot bodies everywhere. The family pools are more relaxing and peaceful. Both have free water and towels and plenty of servers to bring you a cocktail, although you'll pay dearly for it! I will say the pool areas are lacking good food options, all of the items on the menu are premade sandwiches and salads and didn't appeal to me. The restaurants inside the hotel are great, although again pretty pricey (what do you expect??). They all have an Asian flair but the two we ate in, Wazuzu and Wing Lei were great! The crowd is younger on the weekend and apparently XS and Tryst are two of the hottest clubs in town so be prepared to see a bunch of young girls in too short dresses and walking around barefoot after they gave in to their 6 inch platform heels (yeah I'm not bitter! LOL). Of all the hotels in Vegas I have stayed at, I would definitely go back here."
"Hello!?! It's JEAN PHILLIPE!!! My eyes were just going bonkers looking at all the different chocolates that were available. The desserts were so eye catching and tons of souvenirs!!! They have food such as salads, sandwiches, etc. Along with coffee and tea selections. The staff was EXTREMELY helpful and so kind. I had the Opera (chocolate mousse type cake) and a vanilla eclair. THE VANILLA ECLAIR IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!! The cream is on the thicker side and it's the perfect size for your buck! The cafe latte is very good too, smooth and creamy and perfect with the sweet desserts. \n\nSouvenir wise I got the coconut and chocolate macaroons, white chocolate covered pistachios, and coconut tuilles. Every single one of them was so good! The chocolate is such high quality and not too sweet. Gotta stop by whether you buy something or not!"
"I am sorry but this show was just plain BOOORING, the big fat stupid baby is just lame, the host has too much time on the show and its not funny when its desperately trying to be funny. \nDont think im not a Cirque fan because I am, I loved KA and Zumanity, but Mystere is just overated, skip it.\nVery blah."
"I really love this place! my family and I came here once they started on their vegetarian  kick many years ago, and boy we weren't disappointed. \n\nTheir falafels are to die for and the lamb salad is crisp and fresh. My sister is in love with the chicken hummus plate, they provide you with a large serving and it tastes amazing! The hummus is smooth and rich in flavor. \n\nEvery time I'm on a date or am looking for a fun food place with friends i bring them to Aladdin's. My sister even ordered their food for her graduation party. They are great for any occasion!"
"We had a negative experience at Camping World regarding our potential RV purchase on April 10, 2013.\n\nThe Camping World we visited was in Mesa, Arizona (2222 E Main st., Mesa, AZ).\nWe were working with sales person RYAN. (Young Caucasian with furr on his teeth)\n\nRYAN found a used RV that came in on trade that he thought we may be interested in. Camping World hadn't gotten the unit yet, but we were told we could view the used RV soon. To have Camping World's salesman hold the unit for us- he recommended we put a refundable hold deposit of $1000 down, and Ryan (The furry toothed salesman) assured us the deposit was refundable. We also hadn't actually looked at the RV yet, but thought the RV could be a potentially great unit to buy- so we left the $1000 refundable sight unseen deposit.\n\nFor personal reasons, we elected to continue our RV search and asked to get our refundable deposit returned.\n\nObtaining our refundable deposit did not go so smoothly!  I went to Camping World to thank Furry Toothed RYAN for his time, but we decided to take our REFUNDABLE $1000 DEPOSIT back and continue our RV search. This is when RYAN collaborated with his unprofessional Money Hungry Sales Manager to notify him that I was there to get back our deposit and release the hold on the RV we hadn't seen and continue our RV search. This is where these bogus money hungry salesmen began to RAZZ me, a Female Client. Rudely interrogating me with comments like \""Why do you want your deposit back... We've spent a lot of time locating this RV for you\""... Then proceeded to laugh at me like a load of overweight hyenas when I stated that we are simply going to continue our search for the perfect RV for our family and that we would like our refundable deposit back.  I am embarrassed with Camping World, and the Mesa, Arizona Camping World Team should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nI followed up with our furry toothed salesman RYAN via email to share our camping world experience.\n\nI'd like to add that RYAN proclaimed to my hubby (over the phone on April 16, 2013) that him and the sales team were rude to me and interrogated me because they were frustrated on their end because they spent a lot of time locating RV's for us to look at. (Um hey dirtbags, we were shopping for the perfect RV for us, we weren't in the market to just buy something y'all \""worked so hard to find\""... Get a real job lazy schmucks, locating an RV on a computer isn't rocket science.)\n\nI'd like to respond to RYAN by saying that his frustrations are very trivial compared to what we have to manage on a daily basis. I'd also like to explain to RYAN and the Mesa, AZ Camping World Sales Team that asking for our refundable deposit, whatever the reason, doesn't call for disrespect and interrogation of a female client.\n\nWe were looking to purchase a new fifth wheel RV, and were not desperate to just buy anything. We have a very unique living situation, and we were preparing to spend 10's of thousands of dollars on a new RV- and when making this decision, we weren't going to make a purchase until we found the fifth wheel of our liking. A fifth wheel that we love, 100%.\n\nAfter putting down a refundable depoit on a used fifth wheel that we hadn't actually looked at- we decided to continue on with our search for a new fifth wheel.\n\nCamping World's Sales Team in Mesa, Arizona were so desperate to make a sale, that they literally disrespected and interrogated me when I told them we elected to take our refundable deposit back- and continue our search for the perfect RV for our family.\n\nThis is unacceptable, and I certainly do not appreciate my experience with Camping World.\n\nI'd strongly advise buyers to be aware of this when choosing to Shop for RV's at the Mesa, AZ Camping World."
"Previous reviews have said it well: Lackluster, tasteless food.\n\nAte at Primanti Bros with a group of friends while in Pittsburgh; we heard about it from 'Man vs. Food' and were assured that it is a Pittsburgh institution. The sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine ($6-$9), but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food service-grade meat topped with lukewarm fries. Good in theory, bland in execution; it's a lot of calories without the accompanying flavor.\n\nWe also had terrible service at the Market Square location; I'll chalk this up to a fluke. The patio seating at the Market Square location is wonderful on a sunny day, but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning, explaining that it wasn't designed to get wet --but apparently their customers are.\n\nThe legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here, but take your money elsewhere and buy good-tasting food instead of kitsch."
"I've been coming to Kenfield ever since I was 15 years old. I'm 23 now, and I don't trust anyone else with my hair. He does wonderful work for a reasonable price.\n\nI noticed a review before about an awful experience a customer had a little over a week ago, claiming he messed up her hair, and her shirt. Being a long time customer of Ken's I asked about this situation. I would soon find out his side of the story if any of you care to know both sides of the coin.\n\nShe had been to his salon once before. This time, during her visit she informed Ken that someone had messed up her hair, and she needed him to fix it with the box color she had in hand. During her experience she never once complained about burning from the color. I myself have just bleached my hair & I understand how much a burn can hurt, but if the color was burning her & dripped down her neck & ruined her shirt, then why didn't she say anything in the beginning? Coloring your hair involves chemicals, of course it will damage your shirt if it gets to it, but that's a ridiculous allegation when the capes that are draped over us cover the part of her shirt that's messed up.\n\nKen wants to show the video surveillance of what really went down. Don't let that one bad review color your opinion of Kenfield. Come in, try him. You won't be disappointed."
"The lobby is nice and people are friendly, that's all good until you get to your room.  First the window were so dirty that you could hardly see outside.  We had ticket from a dry cleaning from the people who stayed there before us that wasn't clean.  The table lamp wasn't even hook to the electricity so I had to crawl under the table. And the worst part, we had molds in the ceiling of our shower.  We asked the front desk to have someone come and clean it but it never happened.   I would not recommend this hotel.  there are so many other hotels that are so much better."
"This place is solid in every way.  Great local brewed beer.  The food is surpisingly good every time.  The menu is huge and they really do everything well from pastas and pizzas which are excellent to their Philly, which is equally great (they put a little gravy on it, mmm), and wraps.  Fries are darn good.  Servers are all nice and like working there. It shows.  Good lunch specials.  Good happy hour too with half priced appetizers.\n\nI really recommend this place.  Solid and semi-local.  Can get busy but I always sit at the bar.\n\nPS.  Believe it or not I met my wife there a few years ago!  Thats why it gets the 5th star.  :)"
Phenomenal New York Pizza! One if the best pizzas I have ever had in my life. Very delicious. The service was top notch here and very fast as well. It is very affordable pricing along with a cozy setting. :) Highly recommend this place!
"Great service, terrible food. I was looking forward to eating at Christo's and the longer I was there, the more disappointed I became. Funky house salad with a creamy ranch (?) dressing and one slice of bad hot house tomato. The lemon rice soup was boiling hot, but not awful. White French baguette bread and butter was plentiful, thank god. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was bland and my veal entr\u00e9e was drowned in sauce. The service was 5 star, I'll give them that. I suppose I came away with the thought that I'd rather have lousy service and good to great food than great service and lousy food. Maybe I should have tried one of the 3,000 specials our Italian waiter rattled off before we ordered. By the time he was finished, the only thing I remembered him saying was, \""...topped with feta cheese.\"""
"As a NYC girl I have to say this is the first time I ever ordered from here and had delivery from the Surprise AZ Chain, and this will be the last time I ever order. I ordered baked Ziti and it was so dry and looked like they baked a whole pan of it and then take from the pan and Microwave it to heat it, The Ziti noodles were hard I ordered chicken wings as well I did not get any blue cheese dressing & Celery as I asked for and there Garlic Bread was definetely nuked, it is as hard as a Hardball you can not even chew it. what a waste of money. People who say this place is excellent must not be from NY...Sorry to write such a bad review but it is the truth..."
"Since we had a coupon ($25 for $50 of food) that was set to expire, my husband & I dined here for a belated birthday dinner.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to our expectations.\n\nService was very slow.  It took over 5 minutes to be greeted by the assistant waiter, than 10 more for our head waiter to take our drunk order.  I had the lemon drop which was pretty good.  The wine recommended to my husband was enjoyable.\n\nI had the onion soup to start and it was nothing special.  I ate maybe a fourth of it.  I ordered the petite filet and my husband the bone-in ribeye.  I chose the mashed potatoes and he chose the lobster mac-n-cheese.  (I don't eat seafood.)  It took a very long time to get our food. The steaks were nothing special.  My mashed potatoes are better.  These were bland.  We skipped dessert and won't be back."
"I came here with a group of friends on a trip to Vegas and was thoroughly disappointed.  We were expecting a nicer Mexican restaurant considering the prices and food discriptions - but I was less than wowed.\n\nWhile the waitstaff was nice, the service was very slow.  We waited about 15 minutes for our drinks.  Dinner wasn't great either.\n\nI had the Mexican Chopped Salad which is supposed to include red peppers, tomato, apple, beans, onion, corn, avacado and lettuce.  When they brought it to me I literally thought it was the wrong dish because all I could see was lettuce and chicken.  There were no apples or peppers and a sprinking (I mean like 10 kernals) of corn and beans.  It was laughable and NOT worth $17.\n\n2 girls ordered the Turkey Tostada, which was a cute presentation on two small corn tortillas, but they complained that the turkey was overwhelmingly salty, and avoided it all together.\n\nOthers liked the quesadillas and drinks were good, which is why I give this review 1-2 stars.\n\nHad the menu been more appropriately priced I wouldn't have been as annoyed - but I could have found a MUCH better meal for $30 somewhere else.  \n\nWho knew a head of lettuce and a glass of wine could eat up so much money!? ... I should've put it into slot machines, that would've been less of a throw away :)"
"This location is terrible. I usually don't shop at Walmart, mostly because of their policies and politics, but in this case I was shopping online and they had 1 of the items I was looking for in stock so I ordered for store pick up so I wouldn't have to wait for it to be shipped from another online retailer. When I showed up to pick up my item, I waited for about 30 min in the customer service line before being told I was in the wrong line. Seriously? Why wasn't I told this in the pick-up email or why wasn't there a sign posted?!\n\nI then made my way to the back of the store near layaway, which also doubles as a Walmart .com pick-up counter. There were only 2 people in front of me but I waited another 20-30 min there before it was my turn because there was only 1 associate at the counter. When I got up to the counter, the associate left for a while with no explanation while I stood there for about 5 min wondering whether anyone was going to return to assist me. When the associate finally returned and looked up my order, she shouted to another person to grab my order for her so that she could run to the bathroom. Talk about customer service...what a hassle to shop at Walmart!"
"Who.\n\nWho.\n\nWho hasn't been yet, and why?"
"I decided to go after reading all of the reviews and because I live really close and decided to check it out. I was disappointed with the service, it took us about fifteen minutes + to get a drink. It was probably because there was only one waiter working and the place was very busy. I was surprised how busy it was for a Wednesday, but not too surprised after I was actually able to order and eat the food. We ordered the sun roll, phoenix roll and caterpillar roll. The rolls were small, but good. Out of the three rolls we ordered, the sun roll was my favorite. The food is great, but the service is slow."
"He is the GOD of magicians. Knows how to entertain, knows how to mesmerize his audience, even someone like me who is one of the most scrutinizing viewer of illusion. I got my ticket last minute from half-off store, paid $20 less. I was at the door half an hour before to avoid crowd. Got my seat on 2nd section, which was little back but not bad. He was very entertaining, I have no idea how he does that. After the show, he asked us not to write detailed review about his tricks, I will respect that. But he managed to disappear 13 people at once, that was my highlight (sorry David, I guess I have to give a little detail). Money good spent, it was a must see show."
"Hello to all my fellow foodies :)\n\nHere it is 2 years after my first experience and for some odd reason I chose to celebrate my birthday again at Salt Cellar.  I was really craving some seafood and at the time I forgotten just how poor the first experience was....so.... a group of us met at the tiny overcrowded bar area.\n\nWe were allowed to bring our appetizers to the table and still pay the \""happy hour\"" prices... I though this was decent of them.\n\nI was craving scallops and asked more than once if scallops were in season, as I know there are certain times of the year when such items are \""in season\"" therefore providing a fresher delicacy.\n\nThe one thing I really enjoyed the last time was their bread... it was crusty and soft and absolutely delicious.  I was told the bread is the same as it always was....NOT!\n\nDont tell me what you think I want to hear!  The bread was NOTHING like it used to be....this time is was simply \""bread\""....nothing at all good or special about it.\n\nAfter many appetizers, we were served our salad...again, nothing special..very basic, except for mine... I guess I got the birthday surprise... a long hair attached to a piece of lettuce! DISGUSTING... \n\nI showed the waiter who was very professional about it and seemed almost embarassed.\n\nThe group of us tried several items.  I got the scallops...after being assured they are in season and very good... Why do I bother to ask, when I know they cant say something like \""oh no...dont go with the scallops, they are small and not really the time of year for them\"" and you'll regret it!\n\n\nThese small morsels were overcooked and rubbery and lacked any flavor!\n\nA couple people got surf and turf and the steak also lacked any flavor/seasoning and was not cooked to was was requested.\n\nThe lobster, I was told was o.k but nothing to rave about.\n\nWe experiemented with some shrimp toast which I really cant describe because I am not sure what it tasted like other than salty...couldnt not detect the shrimp taste.\n\n\nI returned my scallops and after the hair and rubbery food had no desire to try anything else.\n\nThe owner had come over to the table and apologized for the \""series of events\"", his excuse for the hair being that due to the ventilation system hair and partical will fly around... (which of course has to land somewhere...why not my salad) \n\nThey removed my scallops from the check....duhhhh any mediocore place would do the same.\n\nI would like to give a special THANK YOU to our waiter.. my apologies for not remembering your name, but he was terrific!  Friendly, quick and when we needed him...he was around.\n\nWe got out of there with what I feel is a HIGH price to pay for such a distasteful experience.\n\nWhen I got home and after hearing my friends give their critique of my choice of restaurant to celebrate at I was pretty unhappy!\n\nI felt the owner, although a nice man, did not care enough about his customers to do something a little \""above and beyond\"" to apologize for the experience and try to keep a customer.\n\nI called the restaurant and spoke with the owner and told him I was very dissapointed and felt that he should have done something more than make excuses.. he kept apologizing and I assured him none of the 5 of us would every return to Salt Cellar.\n\nHe finally said he would like to do something for me and asked for my address.\n\nHere it is a couple weeks later...not sure why he wanted my address...maybe he is gonna picket my house or send mean letters...who knows... he never did anything!\n\nIt is clear to see why his restaurant is not packed as it was years ago....You may have the repeat business from those who have been patronizing your establishment from back in the day when your food was actually good, or there were no other options for seafood...but guess what?  There are other options!\n\nAt this point in my review I usually suggest you go and try for yourself...but this time I am going to save you the time and money....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!\n\nYou will be glad you did.\n\nAs for the owner of Salt Cellar....apologies and excuses are simply words....Stand behind your restaurant...you should have wanted to prove to me that you do a better job than was we experienced.\n\nYou are cutting too many corners to save money and it is costing you your customers!\n\nYour actions speak for themselves!\n\nIt used to be when you mention Salt Cellar people would ooohhh and ahhh...those days are gone, most of the people I mention it to have no idea what Salt Cellar is.\nThat speaks VOLUMES!\n\nAnd so I say... Bon Appetite'"
This place always runs out of items on the menu. I've ordered the chicken fried steak twice and it never comes with the fresh bread they advertise. In this visit alone I've heard the waitress tell two tables they didn't have baked potatoe or a breakfast item. Our waitress appeared lithargic and took a long cigarette break while all her tables waited on her and the cook. It was bad enough she didn't check up on her guest often enough. The team leader is no better. She's helped us twice before. Never smiles. its enough to make someone depressed. Luckly the food they have is great on an empty stomach. Love the unlimited hot coco. Avoid the water. Tastes like algee.
"So I have been hearing about this place for years. Didn't expect much and wasn't disappointed. The food wasn't good but that wasn't the worst. The management doesn't have a clue. I was there with a few friends. There was a large table near us where one couple had brought their toddler boy, I'm guessing around 2. He was acting like a 2 year old. Mom and dad were doing their best to keep him occupied but he was rather active. The problem was the management and wait staff were demeaning, loud and downright rude to the mother about her son's behavior. We didn't really see anything out of control and the poor kid was 2. The staff made our table very uncomfortable throughout our dinner. We debated on whether to leave but decided against it. Should have left as our dinners were barely edible after suffering through the constant humiliation we were witnessing. It was obvious all the tables around us were also uncomfortable with the display as well. Even as someone without kids and not planning to have them, I will not be back. The display by the management was deplorable."
"Five stars for these reasons:\n\nGenuinely friendly employees.\nMotivated employees.\nGood prices on coffee.\nGood prices on beer.\nGood prices on wine.\nGood prices on glassware.\nGood selection of household items like wicker baskets from the Near East.\nGood selection of imported consumable goods like jellies, jams, and snacks from several major regions around the world.\nThe only place in \""the world\"", apparently, that sells all-cotton white towels with a high thread count and a chevron molded pattern.\n\nAnd genuinely friendly employees. Yes, that counts for a LOT!\n\nThe location is convenient."
"Horrible experience with Dr Lisa (didn't catch her last name). I've used this vet before and I like Dr Winn. But I won't go back after the way I was just treated by a business that potentially would've received $500 or more from me. \n   Dee at the front desk has a terrible, unfriendly, unwelcoming attitude.  The vet wanted ME to decide on a course of treatment which made me feel like the reason I waited in the exam room for almost an hour was because she was Googling the condition on the internet based on what I told the young lady at check in!!\n   Ultimately, I didn't like the way she grabbed my docile, calm cat to begin the exam. Then when I (yes, ME) wasn't sure if the infection was bladder or uterine related she got very condescending and unprofessional. I put my cat back in her carrier, walked out and checked Yelp in the car for another vet and made an appointment elsewhere for later today. I wish Dr Winn would clean house. Jess, at the front desk, is a sweetheart. His business could be so much better without the dead weight."
The 3 person team arrived early but that was ok.  I asked the price and after a bit of communication issues was given an hourly rate.  I have a very small front & back yard.  They rang the door 35 minutes later for their money and I was told I owed for a full hour ($95).  When l talked to the owner nothing was said about a minimum charge. They would have bad a repeat client had They been honest.
We went with a large group for lunch and the service was great. Friendly and totally cool about having separate checks. The food is decent too. I wouldn't say I'm a fan but it's better than OK. :)\n\nCheck out their daily specials too!
"WORST PLACE EVER! Customer service is pretty much non existent, they're rude and slow. Also their gel products are cheap. I came to get a gel fill in with a lady named \""Nina\"" and the nails are ok, but the polish job was terrible. It was all clumpy and wrinkly, I asked her about and she was like \""it's ok I fix for you\"" and she didn't of course. I got home that same night and all the gel started to peel off, I came back the next day and asked them to fix it. I chose a different color just in case it was that one batch. But no. Same thing happened again and they refused to give me my money back. From someone who's been to over 100 nail salons in the past 10 years I can honestly say that this was my worst experience ever! DON'T waist your time or money with these people."
"If you are looking for authentic Italian cuisine, VinciTorio's is a must try. My roommate, who lived in Italy for a year, says that their food is the real thing. No diets allowed here.\n\nTheir Burrata e Pere is a great starter mixing sweet and salty with a combination of cream cheese and pears wrapped in proscuitto. My favorite dish is their Agnolotti Carbonara, which is ravioli stuffed with chicken and sausage in a cream sauce, topped with bacon. Like I said, be prepared to have a real meal here. \n\nThe owners are visible on most nights and have pictures of their trips to Italy up for customers to view. The wait can be longer on weekend nights, but they have an excellent patio and bar to enjoy a glass of wine while you wait. \n\nAdditionally, the wait staff is incredibly patient and friendly. My friends and I have closed down this place on quite a few occasions and have never been met with an impatient waiter trying to shove us out the door."
"Love this place!  Great place to go safely hiking and get a workout.  But it is a trail where it is harder to come back - more uphill.  Most hikes you reach your peak and then it's all downhill from there.  Not this place :)  Great views!  Usually see Chuckwallas (lizards) and I just saw my first rattlesnake on this trail and I have probably hiked this trail 20 or more times.  If you are visiting Scottsdale, you must go, even if you just get to the peak, without heading over to the second mountain.  Fabulous!"
Slowest Starbucks I've been to.... Unfortunate because this one is a convenient location to where I live but the drive through always takes 10-15 minutes whether there's 2 people in line or 12.  People very nice and friendly but not effect enough for how quick Starbucks is elsewhere
"Happy Halloween Costco members.  Come see us soon, the fuel price this week is $2.759."
"Eaten here a few times and the good was pretty good. HOWEVER, tonight (Valentines Day) I had reservations for my girlfriend and I and when we arrived, they had no idea who we were. This apparently happened to two other couples as well, and we were all forced to wait for an opening. After waiting for 50m with constant promises of being seated soon, we eventually had to leave because we were going to miss our show. When we were leaving, I told the hostess how disappointed I was and she essentially said it wasn't her fault EXTREMELY rudely.\n\nNo food is worth being treated this poorly. I am now eating a burger for Valentines dinner with a girl dressed to the nines and we stick out like a sore thumb. I am just praying we still make our show tonight."
I've been in here before and it was always your standard run-of-the-mill nail salon. They take walk-ins and give you good service for a good price. I went in to treat myself to a pedicure last Friday and had what was probably the best pedicure may have ever had. Pam did my nails and she was amazing! She got my feet looking nicer than other nail technicians ever have and gave me the greatest foot massage. I will definitely be requesting Pam again!
The worst Macaroni Grill I've ever been to!  Do not waste your time!!!
My chicken was so plain. I was upset with it. It was just teriyaki chicken. Hard to mess up. I doubt ill be back. It is a relaxing place tho. Just dont go for the food.
We have been here on many many occasions and the food is always hot hot and fresh. I have never had a bad meal here. The wait at times can be long but it is worth the wait for Alfredo's green chili pork. It is delicious!! Hot fresh chips and salsa makes it even better.\n\nWe had my daughters wedding rehearsal dinner here (yes it is a groom thing...but well) they placed our group in the meeting room and it was wonderful. We had our own servers and a full bar. The manager made me a great deal considering we had to pay. Everyone left full and happy...\n\nThis is Mesa's little secret
"I went in late on a Sunday afternoon with shoulder pain that was severe enough to warrant an immediate trip to a doctor. After looking on yelp to see what was in my area, I made a visit to Alliance Urgent Care and I'm glad I did. After a very reasonable wait for a late Sunday walk-in, I saw Dr. Dale Schuerman, and found him to be very pleasant and attentive to my needs. If I am ever in need of an urgent care facility again, this will be the place I will visit."
"Einfach, gut, unkompliziert.\n\n\n Car-Sharing in Karlsruhe ist weit verbreitet- immerhin gibt es Stadtmobil hier seit mehr als 10 Jahren, und das zu Recht.\n\n\n Wer nicht wei\u00df, wie Autoteilen funktioniert, sieht am besten auf den oben angegebenen Webseiten nach. \nIn K\u00fcrze: nicht jeder hat sein eigenes Auto, sondern die Gemeinschaft hat viele an verschiedenen Standpl\u00e4tze, und man benutzt eines, wenn man es braucht. Bezahlt wir neben einer geringen j\u00e4hrlichen Grundgeb\u00fchrt nach einer Mischung aus Kilometer- und Zeittarif (Treibstoff inbegriffen). \nSo wird viel gespart: Unterhalt, Parkpl\u00e4tze, Versicherung, Kosten durch Benzinpreisschwankungen.\n\n\n F\u00fcr mich am praktischsten ist immer, dass man Autos verschiedener Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und zu verschiedenen Zwecken buchen kann. Mal einen Transporter, ob f\u00fcr eine kleine Ausfahrt auch ein Cabrio. In jedem Auto (au\u00dfer Smart) befindet sich ein Kindersitz, weiter k\u00f6nnen im B\u00fcro gebucht werden - auch das ist also keine Ausrede.\n\n\n Im Raum Karlsruhe gibt es unz\u00e4hlige Standpl\u00e4tzen, an denen Autos abgeholt werden k\u00f6nnen. Und dies nicht nur in Ka, sondern auch in der Umgebung: Pl\u00e4tze Baden-Baden, Bruchsal, Eggenstein, Ettlingen, Gaggenau, Landkreis Rastatt, Pfinztal, Rheinstetten, Stutensee und Weingarten geh\u00f6ren zur gleichen Institution. Dar\u00fcber hianus gibt es Quernutzungsm\u00f6glichkeiten von Car-Sharing-Vereinigungen in anderne St\u00e4dten.\n\n\n Was ich hier nun noch einmal schildern will, ist die umkomplizierte Art der Karlsruher Stadtmobil: jedes meiner Anliegen wurde in den letzten Jahren schnell und zu meiner vollen Zufriedenheit gel\u00f6st. In Notf\u00e4llen (Geheimnummer vergessen und am Tresor stehend und \u00e4hnliche F\u00e4lle...) war immer sofort jemand zur Stelle - im B\u00fcro sind immer alle sehr nett und einfach kundenfreundlich.\n\n\n Fazit: \nCarSharing ist f\u00fcr mich die Ideale alternative zum \""Zweitwagen\"" f\u00fcr Familien und in Karlsruhe bei Stadtmobil ist man damit auch noch bestens aufgehoben."
"great yogurt flavors, cake batter was very delicious but makes me wonder how much sugar is in the flavors. not much sugar free flavors. definitely kid friendly. there are tons of toppings to add including fresh fruit and boba. there were kids running everywhere so it felt awkward. It's good, but I think I'd go somewhere else since I don't have kids. atmosphere is family friendly, there's coloring pages done by kids on a bulletin board. I'm a college kid, so it's not the place for me. I still prefer cherry on top/ u swirl/yogurtland."
"I was looking for a place with free wi fi and went to Tea Station yesterday but the wi fi wasn't working. I found this place via Yelp just a mile or so away. Boy, am I glad I did!\n\nThe restaurant is clean and spacious, has free wi fi, two flat screen tvs, and a comfortable vibe. The staff is very nice, doesn't rush you and push suggestions on you. If you're like me and needed to finish your taxes or work they give you all the space and time you need without making you feel like you've overstayed your welcome.\n\nOf course, the food is good also. They're known for their stinky tofu, which I didn't order but smelled authentic. I ordered a milk tea with boba which was perfect. I also tried their Fu Chou fishball soup which was delicious and unique. To finish, two of us shared the shaved ice plate which was plenty for two.\n\nI'd give this place 4.5 stars but since there's no such thing I'm rounding up.\n\nBottom line, better value and environment than Tea Station. We'll be back!"
"We went on a random Thursday night for dinner.  Our expectations were thinking this local establishment might be a great local pub with sub par food.  This is what we found. \n\nOur server was friendly enough and welcoming, but dining room area is out dated decor.  Food was not awful, but just barely average.  I had a salad and my husband had a fish sandwich.  They arrived quickly, were reasonably priced and by friendly staff, but the food was nothing special.  Nothing unique or notable about either one. \n\nThe bar area up front seems like a small, local friendly place to go after work, but I would skip the food."
"Rude, that's all i have to stay about the staff and service at this branch."
The ultimately slowest sbux EVER!!!!!!!they seem to have plenty of employees but the speed just isn't there! Isn't Starbucks supposed to be convenient ?
"This is one of the most over hyped restaurant that I have ever been to.  I know it's a Pittsburgh legend. I have been there several times and every time say to myself, I won't be going back.  I only go there when dragged by coworkers.  \n\nThe restaurant is always packed, service is slow and you have to get up to get a drink refill from the cashier.  Yes it's unique having fries and cole slaw on your sandwiches, but the sandwiches are horrible.  Burnt Roast Beef or poor quality cheese steaks just don't cut it with me."
design orgasm.
"This is the RUDEST Trader Joes I've been to. It was like walking into Walmart, only worse if that's possible. Only one person/employee in the whole store had anything resembling MANNERS! !\nYIKES!!!"
"Carl's Jr.....Good place for burgers.  I always enjoy their guacamole burger which is grubtastic!  ;)  This location is also pretty quick about serving their food especially when your on your lunch break which is an advantage over other locations I've been to.  Place is neat, clean, and staff are friendly.  :)"
Best breakfast burrito in the valley. I have been here dozens of times since I have lived down the street forever and it is an old favorite. You will not be disappointed.
"We were a party of 5, aged 17 - 89 years old.  The restaurant is very pretty, and quiet (nice for the 89 year old), but none of us were wowed by the place.  The food was just OK - nothing spectacular.  For the price, we should have been wowed.  My starter, marrow bones, was my favorite part of the meal and it was delicious.  Unfortunately, I wanted a spoon (maybe even one of those tiny marrow bone spoons?) to scoop the marrow out to spread on the bread, but our waiter was busy elsewhere.  I finally stopped a different server, asked for a spoon, and received another knife and fork.  Sigh.  Now, it's two weeks later, and I don't even recall what we ate - just that no-one was delighted.  Like I said, nothing was bad.  It's just that for over $300 it should have been great."
"I think that this is the closest off-campus restaurant to CMU. The price is fine and you get a large amount of food. The service here is quick and efficient, but no one is very friendly. That's fine, as I hardly ever eat in and only stop by to pick up a meal.\n\nTheir bubble tea is pretty good. I especially recommend the mango bubble tea. Also, the chow fun is pretty good as well.\n\nOverall, the food is tasty, the service is quick, and the price is alright. Not bad for a conveniently close restaurant"
"I was in Vegas for a couple of days and had an afternoon free. Decided to check out Bauman Rare Books...so glad I did!! It was my first time at the store and I was overwhelmed at all that they had there...some amazing items!! I was especially taken by the historical ones, such as The Federalist and The Declaration of Independence (to name a small few). There is something for everyone in this store from Walt Disney to books from the literary greats!  You can not help but find something exceptionally interesting in every part of the store.  I would've spent even longer there but didn't want to overdue my stay with the very kind woman that was working (forgot her name)...but she was extremely friendly and informative! Whether you want to window show or purchase, the staff seems inviting, friendly, and willing to share background on all the pieces.  What a gem of a store...I will be sure to make the store a visit on my next trip to Vegas and highly recommend it to any one that may be in Vegas or visiting!!"
"What the hell happened here?? The service is slow, food is mediocre, quality is slipping, dining area is dirty and decrepit... This used to be an inexpensive alternative to PF Changs.. Now it's a half step above Denny's. You're off your game BIG TIME."
By far the most greasiest pizza I've had in Vegas. Total disappointment.
It was OK. A Mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy! Food was average at best. Service was good and the strawberry margarita was good but the food was not impressive.
Confirm the other posts. Don't waste your time at this rude place. Show up at their ppen time and doors wide open but tell you they are closed and not even an invite to come back. Good to not need the business I guess.
"Every time I go to PJ I know what to expect...great service and exceptional food. Their philly pita is my favorite, however the gambas con ajo (shrimp and tomatoes) is a very close second. I'm a regular at pita jungle and would suggest it to anyone and everyone looking for amazing healthy food at a fair price."
We called George to help us build two media centers to accommodate our electronics and large televisions. George gave us a fair price and did excellent work. We are very happy with his company and his services. \n\nThank you Yelp and thank you George.
I love Capriotti's... Just not this location. Dirty restaurant and employees that looked like they were hired right out of a homeless shelter.
"Wow, wow, wow! ...or maybe that should be BOW, WOW, WOW! My dog and I did the self-serve wash today and we are dedicated fans after only one visit! Leah at the front desk made us feel welcome and Tim in the wash bays was capable and personable. For fifteen dollars my large lab is no longer a smelly dog. The wash bays lower (great for older dogs with hurting hips...and super for their human parents who don't have to lift them) and raise to a comfortable height. They provide shampoo, warm water, cotton balls, ear solution, face wash, towels and a blow dryer! I'm home and done...no worrying about doing a load of laundry to wash the dog wash towels...no cleaning the tub, shower, or porch of copious amounts of dog fur...and no worrying that a wet dog will roll in the dirt and then jump on the couch! I love it! We'll definitely be back. Thanks so much. You all are wonderful!"
"It's probably best I declare something before I carry on typing... I'm not a great fan of clubs. Whether on holiday, or at home - I've never had  \""the best night of my life\"" at a place like Pure.\n\nAll signs looked like it'd be a good night - friends had been to Pure, and loved it, we'd read good reviews, and we'd already had our names on the guest list thanks to a girl who worked at one of Caesar's Palaces' bars. \n\nBut from the moment we got there, we knew we weren't going to have a great night. \n\nGeneric, dance music played in every room we walked through. Gloomy looking bar staff giving lousy service. Letchy boys and stroppy girls. \n\nThe views of the strip from the roof top were a high light, and the people we spoke to made the night but definitely not the best night in Vegas. \n\nSomething we learnt that night - don't try too hard to have a good time in Vegas, the good times will find you when you least expect them."
"This is a tough review to write.  The location was great and I'm sure the dinner would've been good too based on the other reviews.\nUnfortunately, my team didn't like anything on the pre-set menu and the restaurant didn't want to work with them on finding alternates.  \nI was a restaurant manager, so yeah, I get it - the food has already been purchased and prepped, etc.  But there were only 8 of us; how hard is it to be flexible?  How hard is it to say, \""Yes of course, but we will have to charge you separately\""?  When a group that is spending a couple thousand dollars on dinner tells you they're going to leave before you even bring the appetizers out, doesn't that concern you?  Wouldn't you send a manager over?\nIf you're Cowboy Ciao, the answer to all of these is no.  What a bummer."
"Always busy, always a full parking lot. Be prepared to hoof it.\n\nGreat selection, friendly staff."
"I wouldnt call this a premiere resort. The suite was small, and needed a major update to compete with other area resorts, ie. Tube television. The bathroom was very small and in one of our rooms was missing toilet paper and a working lock. The grounds looked like they needed a major paint job and some pruning of plants.  I had a lovely view of the highway, but luckily the noise was not a problem. On the upside, the kids enjoyed thw waterpark, but at times the lazy river and slides were closed. There was confusion over the opening times on Sat, which left our girls frustrated. If you are looking for a focus on kids waterpark, okay grounds and room, this will work for you.  If you are more interested in an overall resort experience, go to the Fairmont Princess."
Worst customer service ever!  Completely disgusted with the service received at this VA hospital...Operators blind transfer you to other departments that hang up on you...First time registering?  Expect to be put on a 3 to 6 month waiting list just to talk to someone to set up an appointment no matter how bad you need to see a DR..\n\nVeterans DESERVE better than this!!
"Hands down my favorite hotel in Vegas. The MO franchise continues to impress me with how they effortlessly blend their Far East zen-and-beauty identity into any environment. MOLV is no exception, as it defies odds by being a peaceful oasis in the middle of a sinister desert (literally) that is Vegas. \n\nUpon arrival, we were thoughtfully greeted by the concierge (who offered us tea during check in). When we entered our room, the windows automatically pulled open and a brilliant glance of the Vegas strip was readily in front of us. Rooms are spacious and the amenities plentiful. Bathrooms include both a standing shower and a huge bathtub (not to mention two sinks...a true luxury). The bed is so comfy, especially after a long flight out west/non-stop gambling.\n\nWhile MOLV does not have a casino itself, there are too many near by for matter. Aria is walking distance via the sky bridge, and Monte Carlo (among others) are all within a 5 min walk.\n\nSome other things to love:\n\nWake up in the AM and take a dip in the pool. Not your typical pool park, but big enough to relax and roam around. There are a mix of jacuzzis and swimming pools to enjoy from.\n\nBreakfast at MOzen. Simple but flavorful Chinese (and Western) breakfast. Prices are up there, but definitely worth your hangover cure/detox. Get up early, eat the congee, and conquer the day at casinos around the strip!\n\nJanice - this review is dedicated to you :)"
"This Hotel is a little past it's prime......was there for Xmas '09 with the family...and was lured by its 3 nites for the price of two deal.  I arrived around 11PM...the line for Check-in was long...as they had the \""individual lines\"" method instead of \""one big line\"" method, which makes check in much longer, but it \""looks\"" better.  Despite ordering 2 Bd, non-smoking, they said they only have 1 King rooms.  After complaining, they put me into a 2 bd smoking room since they ran-out of non-smoking rooms...whatever.  Elevators up to the rooms had brass which was cloudy and unpolished, the first sign a hotel is deteriorating.  Room was OK....except the trash can was not emptied and hair dryer was not working.  The room had only a square TV and was showing it's age.  Compared with similar class NY NY and Excalibur, the room is much, much worse, as both NY NY and Excalibur has remodeled its rooms with nice furniture great flat-screen TVs.\n\nThe next day, they did put us in a non-smoking room...but when we got to the room it was not yet cleaned....yuck.  After complaining some more, we got two free buffets, so it was fine.  Overall, a bad experience...except for the free buffets after we complained a lot.  No wonder it had a  3 nights for 2 deal.\n\nFor a similar price/class:  Stick with Excalibur or NYNY"
"Frankly amazing Chinese food place find in Madison.I have been to China several times and this is pretty much authentic-tasting. The MaPo Tofu is amazing as well as the Sichuan Eggplant. If you are looking for some good, real-as-China Sichuan cooking, try this place! Perhaps a little pricey for take-out Chinese but it is so worth it!"
"Ok so I'm posting this due to the location that I'm in, but I'm on the putters that's located on las Vegas Blvd .

"I hate Bank of America more than anything else in the world.  I am a peaceful person who would rather cut off my left arm than offend anyone or get into a fight.  But, I swear, B of A brings out a side of me that I wish I never had to see, and the unfortunate part is that I usually end up taking it out on the unsuspecting customer service rep on the other end of the phone line.  I have never in my life banked with a company that goes so far out of their way to screw people over and assess unnecessary fees.  I have paid B of A hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees over the last year due to their screwed up system and logic that they will undoubtedly try to convince you is somehow appropriate.  For example, I made a charge to Food Lion using my debit card and my pin number, which means that charge should come through on my account IMMEDIATELY.  Instead, it didn't come out for two days, on the same day as an automatic withdrawal for a student loan payment.  The financial geniuses at this corporate mega-money factory decided that since they waited for two days to take it out, now they would take the debits out from largest to smallest, with no regard for the date and/or method of payment used.  So, in a nutshell, I was charged two, count 'em two, overdraft fees and when I spoke to customer service, they simply read the policy out of their little manual, attempting to explain it to me like I have an IQ of 50 with no offer to make the situation better even when I threatened to close my account.  Bottom line:  they don't care about me, my money, my life, or my circumstances.  All they care about is whether or not I'm stupid enough to continue paying them overdraft fees.  I closed my account and switched to a smaller credit union and I couldn't be happier with my decision."
"I've been a Camelback CrossFit member for eight months and have loved every second of it. Being new to CrossFit I was naturally nervous to join.  However, with Coach Matt and Coach Robert's help, I felt completely comfortable every work out. Not only are you getting best in class coaching but you really feel like all of the coaches care about you. The monthly fees are the best in town."
"I have gone to the festival for the past two years and I went with a few friends to the arts festival last Sunday and it was really nice. This festival is large and has LOTS of vendors ( a lot who sell similar stuff, but then many who sell cool and different things). This is such a fun activity to do on a sunny day like last Sunday, and the place has some really nice items for gifts that will be different than buying some garbage from walmart (I'm looking at you crazy black friday pepper spray lady...). You can sample some interesting foods and drinks, for example, I tried a wine slushy. It was....different. This is definitely an event worth attending."
"My boyfriend and I wanted to go soem where and try some thing new so we made the choice to dine at zinks because a couple of people said that it was good and we had to go. WHAT A BIG LET DOWN. We started off with the lamb lollipops and the crab cake (yes it was only one). The lamb lollipops where extremly salty and the crab cake was dry like it had been cooked to long. Then we had the lettece wedge salad when enough dressing to cover like on leaf of lettece. On to the main course I had the hailbate and he had salmon and it was bland and something that could have made. On top of that I had to keep asking for them to refill my water. Its a really classy, nice, place with a wonderful atmospher   but its over rated."
"My girlfriend and I ate here recently and I get nauseas thinking about this place.\n\nI ordered a seafood dish with noodles and veggies. The scallops were still very cold in the center. The little corncobs (cant think of the name) tasted stale in my dish as well as my girlfriends. I could only eat a few bites and I had to quit. \n\nI hate complaining when I go places and I should have said something to them, but instead I will simply not return and let others know to avoid this place. Simply put, the food sucks and this place needs to close."
"Had heard alot of good things about this place so gave it a try.  Pretty dissapointing to say the least.  I ordered the club sandwich and unlike any other club sandwich Ive ordered elsewhere this was pretty much just a turkey sandwich, very little ham and a few small pieces of bacon.  Arent \""club\"" sandwiches supposed to be tall double deckers??  This looked like something I would make at home.  Definetly not an $8 plus sandwich.  Hubby had a turkey burger, which again at about $8 bucks looked about the size of a regular hamburger at McDonalds.  Red Robin burgers are a million times better for the same price.  The onion rings were soggy and greasy and most of the batter had fallen off.  One bright spot was the slice of pizza we ordered.  Hubby said it was yummy.  All in all this is one of those places where I just dont get what people like about it.  Food was very blah and not worth the money.  Maybe its good for drinks and happy hour appetizers but dont waste your time or money for a meal, there are much better places to go for less money."
"We had the most amazing server!!  He was so attentive to our needs.  The biggest thing I noticed is when he came by to take our order, he would notice that we were talking and he would make a round to come back again.  He didn't want to disrupt the conversation.  It was so polite!!\nThe food was also great.  Between the four of us, not one of us had a complaint.  I would for sure go again and I would tell others to go as well.  \nOh and the atmosphere is super fun too :)"
"NIGHTMARE ON FREMONT ST\n\nMy driver dropped me off at the hotel in the back and when I say driver I received a ride alone in a short bus from the airport. I was staying in the Carson tower and when I walked in I was informed to go to the Carson tower registration. \n\nSo I started walking through the craziness of a Vegas Casino. Maneuvering around tired people who are drinking a lot and losing too much money. They are like rats trapped in a box for 4 days and 3 nights and are in no hurry to go anywhere. But I pushed on and made my way past the mayhem while dragging my suitcase to get to the Carson tower for check in.\n\nWhen I arrived at the Carson registration desk there was a sign that said Desk closed. Check in at the Rush Tower. What? So now I had to go back through the mayhem again. I pushed through and when I got to the Rush Tower there was a sign that informed me to check in at the Gold Tower registration because the desk was closed. What?\n\nAt this point I felt like there were hidden cameras laughing at my every move. I took a deep breath and decided to look for the Gold Tower registration. I asked the lady running the high roller Keno room and she pointed me to the VIP check in door. I knew this wasn't correct but I was frustrated and I was going to make it work. \n\nSo I walked in with my frustrated face and informed the staff of my wild goose chase I had just been on. I also dropped the Keno ladies name because it's always good to drop a name. I believe they took a little pity on me but the staff was very unapologetic to my dilemma. They were also very unfriendly and it was probably because I wasn't a high roller VIP. I did ask them if it's normal to send guests on a scavenger hunt to check in and they looked at me like it wasn't a big deal. I then asked if they were going to fix the incorrect signs and they told me no. After 10 hours of no sleep and traveling I had no more fight in me but I do know this was wrong. \n\nUpon walking to my room I finally walked past the open registration desk for the Gold Tower. I will say this was a frustrating way to arrive at a hotel. \n\nSo I get into my room and start unpacking my bag. I then go to the bathroom to wash my face and realized someone had used the bathroom. Yes someone sat on the toilet seat, used the toilet paper, unwrapped the soap and used a clean towel. I'm too exhausted for this. I called down and spoke with the front desk. I also asked if I could be moved to a new room. Of course my request was denied and a maid was sent up to clean my room. A housekeeping manager walked in and told the maid to clean my whole room including the sheets. She was actually nice and hard working. So I left my room for an hour to let the maid do her job. \n\nDay 2...I wake up early and leave to get my work day started. When I arrived back 4 hours later my room wasn't clean. I spoke with the maid in the hall and she said they would clean my room by 1pm. She even wrote me on her list. I came back to the room at 2pm and it wasn't clean. I called Housekeeping and they said they would send someone up. I got back to my room at 5pm and it was still dirty. I called and spoke with a manager who promised to take care of it and my room was finally cleaned at 6pm. Honestly is it that hard?\n\nDay 3...It was my only day to sleep in and the maid bangs 5 times with the vacuum cleaner even though I had a \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign on my door! Was it necessary to ram my door that many times? It was just rude. She knew what she was doing. \n\nDay 4...The room was prepaid by my client but for some reason the hotel decided to charge my credit card. I called down to the front desk and they were no help. The girl on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Then when I went downstairs that same girl was there. She was mean to me because of our phone call. I asked her to only see a copy of my bill. She printed me a bill with my credit card charged. She then slid open a drawer where she had her personal cell phone and started texting. This was incredibly rude & why would you do this in front of an upset customer. I did snap a photo of her displaying this unacceptable behavior. I really believe the staff needs to go through a hospitality travel course because they don't get it. \n\nThe hotel staff doesn't have any good customer service. The employees seem unhappy and it translates into the bad customer service I received. In all of my travels, I've never seen a more incompetent  staff, then here. \n\nOn another note: the room was nice. I was expecting dirty old gross Vegas but that is not what I received. The casino was very modern. The pool had a shark tank in the middle which was really cool. You could even water slide through the middle of the sharks. This place wasn't what I expected. It's just sad that the customer service isn't there. I score hard on being treated nice and the Golden Nugget failed on every level."
"My fiance and I were really excited to try this place because of the Yelp reviews. I'm not sure if everything we chose was not the right thing to choose, but we were pretty disappointed. \n\nWe started with the Sunrise Spider Roll + Fish egg with tempura soft-shell crab and the crab tasted like muddy crawfish. Maybe not the freshest? It was also really expensive for the portion we received. \n\nMisoshiru was very under-salted. \n\nMy unagi kabayaki was full of bones (I'm guessing this is normal; it was my first time having it) and I spent the entire night picking out pin bones with my chopsticks, which actually really improved my chopstick skills. That was a plus.\n\nMy fiance had the broiled black cod, which he said completely saved his entire experience. I tasted it and agreed.\n\nWhy does fried chicken accompany every meal? It didn't really match any of the flavor profiles of any of our dishes, but it was pretty good taste-wise. Not the best fried chicken or anything, but three little nuggets don't hurt when you're given such a small sushi roll portion. \n\nIdeally, I'd like to try a place two more times before reviewing it, but we will definitely not be coming back. \n\nWe've only tried one other sushi place, Plum, and it's definitely our regular place to go. Until we wanted to be adventurous and try other sushi places. \n\nDisappointed. :(\n\nGood points: Really fast service. We were asked how the food was every half-minute and our table was cleared off after each item was complete. It felt a little rushed but we appreciated the customer service."
"We've tried this place several times in the past few years, and each time that we do, I end up kicking myself for giving it another shot.  I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.\n\nI find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade."
"Finally got a chance to try this place out this visit.  I'm bringing the wifey back next time!\n\nOrdered: \n\nOx-tail chili fries - Wow i love chili fries and this is just like adding heaven to an already great side!  Must have if you like things that are fatty!\nPork Belly Steamed Buns - Very refreshing and nice starter.\nMiyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu - I'm done searching for the ideal burger as it has now arrived.  It's fancy, it's big, it's rich but the way each flavor is introduced bite after bite, chew after chew it's texturally perfect and juicy is an understatement.  \n\nSome go to mecca, i'm coming here for my spiritual fix."
"A friend and I use to go to the place all the time in HS. We use to buy coupon booklets from the Foothill HS Wrestlers. They always had a JM coupon in it... Brings back good memories.. \n\nFew months ago I had family in town and thought this would be a good place to go. WRONG. They forgot to write down my 15 ppl reservation.. We had to wait forever to be seated and then another forever for our food.  My dad loves the place and wanted to go there for his birthday.. Guess what, THEY GAVE OUR RESERVATION AWAY!! We weren't late.. Another big party (that they forgot to write down their reservation for) just so happened to show up before us. So they gave them our reservation! We had to wait for over an hour AGAIN! Then of course our food took awhile to get to us. I know we had a big group but it was a LONG time. Luckily our server (female) was great and very nice. She remembered my dad from last time (I thought that was cool).\n\nThe food here is ok. Ranch is good. Fried zucchini & sauce ROCKS. Pizza OK. Family loves the watermelon & suicide sauce for the wings.\n\nAlso, the place is too dark."
The pictures on the internet all doctored up and nice looking really had us fooled!\n\nAs soon as we walked in we knew this place would be way more ghetto than the pictures.  Smelled gross.  Other people staying in the hotel were pretty ghetto as well.  Reservations screwed up when we checked in resulting in us having to wait awhile.  Room wasn't too bad and the king size bed was nice.  \n\nHaving to walk half a block to get to the parking lot was a pain.  Having the hotel connected to what I believe was a bus station led to lots of fun interactions with bums and vagrants!\n\nI thought the in hotel restaraunt was going to blow but it was actually the best part!\n\nMEHHHHHHHH you get what you pay for i guess
"This only gets two stars because it wasn't the worst meal I ate in vegas (that goes to the rainforest cafe). \n\nWe only ate here because we had a groupon. After reading other reviews I'm not sure whether gratuity was automatically added to trick us or because we had a groupon. Either way 18% was added and then there was a line to add a tip! No thank you! The waitress was good enough. She paid a lot attention to us, which wasn't hard since there were three or four tables at 6 PM. I have a feeling that she automatically adds tips to everyone's check so she can manage to make a living. \n\nThe food was edible. My husband had far more complaints than I did, from raw vegetables to lack of shrimp on his dish. My food wasn't great, but it was hot and freshly made. \n\nI wouldn't eat here again if given the opportunity. There are plenty of delicious places to eat in Vegas, and that includes planet hollywood. Look around, there are other cheap options too. \n\nOn a positive note, they make their ranch in house and it is pretty tasty."
"I used to work in east mesa and would frequently meet with friends for lunch at crackers and co.  \n\nLet me start by saying this was over a year ago, but I never thought to write a review because we always called it \""that place where the servers treat you like crap but has great food\""\n\nThat pretty much sums things up, the food is AWESOME (salad are a must and Red Velvet cake will make you touch yourself) getting seated might take 10 minutes, water will take 15 and food probably about 45....maybe things have improved with a horriable economy?  Last straw for me was a BIG BLACK CURLY HAIR I pulled out of my cake one afternoon.  BAKED IN!!!!  \n\nIt pains me to even think of it still.  Patronize at your own risk!"
"This Marshalls is great for dresses and accessories! I loved shopping here, when I lived in Charlotte. They always have a wide variety of dresses and you will always get a good deal. A large portion of my closet is from this Marshalls and everything I've bought from there is still in great shape."
".......Where are the chopsticks?\n\nA Chinese restaurant is clearly not Chinese when there are no chopsticks on the place setting! Tea was lukewarm upon arrival, tasted unauthentic, with the help of any ambiguous American tea bag. The hot and sour soup had peas...peas! Side of rice was stiff and tasted as if it had been in the cooker all day. Had the stir fry vegetable dish that consisted of broccoli, snow peas and mushrooms overly cooked to mush; where was my bok choy or kai lan or any type of actual authentic Chinese vegetables?!\n\nOne thing I do give them credit for: service was clean, fast, and efficient.\n\nOther than that, your money's better off at Panda Express right down the street. Same quality of food, and at least there you won't have to pay for tip!"
"After hearing from multiple people how amazing this restaurant (and this location in particular) was, I decided it was time to try it out. \n\nThe feel of the place when you walk in is super authentic and welcoming, and the staff was some of the most attentive and polite service I've had at any restaurant in Vegas.\n\nThe House Margarita was delicious and a pretty decent size for the price ($8). The complimentary chips, dip & salsa are very good as well, the salsa has a good kick to it. The combo specialty plates are HUGE. More than enough for one person. Each plate comes with rice & beans plus fideo soup to start the meal. The soup was very flavorful and one of the highlights of the meal. I ordered the chicken enchilada, chicken taco & chicken tostada plate (Combo #6) and only ate half of everything. The person I was with ordered the beef enchiladas (both plates came with rice and beans, so a LOT of food) and he loved his meal as well. \n\nOne thing that should be noted is how AMAZING the view is overlooking The Strip. Definitely a major bonus for dining at this location. Everything was reasonably priced, the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic, and I will definitely be back."
"Hyvee feels clean and fresh, and I like the layout.  I often stop here when I only need a few items and don't want to bother with Woodman's.  Hyvee produce is usually good, except for the time I got home and found my strawberries were already fuzzy! \n\nI like the bulk and natural sections.  Liquor department doesn't have the offerings of Woodmans, but then again, who does?  Bakery also tasty, and deli nice too.\n\nSo there isn't really a helpful smile in every aisle, but a time or two I needed to ask an employee for help locating and item, he or she was polite and helpful.\n\nIts nice how they have a USPS station.\n\nI also like the fuel perks program, when you buy select items you get cents of a gallon of gas, and you can really add those up!  I don't know how long you have to wait to use points, and I'm sure they expire, but its a good idea to gain a little extra from products you'd buy anyway."
"The absolute WORST nail salon I have ever walked into. I didn't even get my nails done. I walked out because I was so disgusted by their lack of customer service. \n\nI went here because they have children's pedi chairs. I take my 3 year old there after a long day at work because I promised her a mommy day. I walk in and explain she doesn't really need a pedi just her nails painted. He tells me $5 and as my daughter runs over to the kid chairs (which no one was using or waiting for) stops her and tells her she can't sit in a chair unless she gets an actual pedicure. My daughter bursts into tears and he tells her \""too bad\"" ASSHOLE!\n\nI walked out and went across the street to Angel Touch Nails. They gladly accommodated me and my daughter and let her sit in a chair\nEven tho they don't have the kid ones. \n\nPeople take their hard earned money places to have experiences! It's not just about\nThe money people. This business should be ashamed!"
"Definitely one of the finest properties in Las Vegas. The location is outstanding with great access to The Strip, McCarran, the highways and tons of other Vegas locales. The building and facilities are immaculate. The Valets, Concierge & security team are the ultimate professionals. We bought a unit as a vacation home in 2011 and its tranquil, safe and a fun place to getaway to."
"If I really enjoyed this chill spot in the Bellagio right beside the large garden. I ate at the bar on a Monday morning, had the lobster omlette....the cheese was just right inside the omlette, the lobster was ok....I really was just looking for a basic breakfast with hashbrowns and toast....and thats exactly what I got. Hashbrowns were good...nothing was too greasy, I didn't feel bloated afterwards, it was very peaceful and I like how you get a little container of honey with your tea and different jams. If you just want a basic breakfast that isn't too expensive, defiantly come here. I will go here again if I stay at the Bellagio."
"Okay before I start talking about food let me tell you that being an Indian student I have had the best and worst of Indian food and I was prepared for anything when I entered the restaurant.\nI was also a bit cautious regarding the service since my friends had a harrowing time with the management (A tale for another day). Once seated, the waiter-cum-floor manager impatiently prodded us for the order (5 times in a gap of 5 minutes). Irritated already, we hurried and went for Onion Pakoras for starters, few Rotis, Paneer Masala and Aloo Gobi for the main course. \nThe Decor was boring and dull with rolls of curtain carelessly hanging from the walls. Since Aesthetics hardly matter to me, I ignored it. \nThe food did not arrive for 25 minutes and neither did the pesky waiter. Looking around, we found all the waiters having a great time sharing anecdotes and sipping on a drink. \nFinally after 30 minutes, the main course arrives without the starters being served. I could not imagine what excuse the management could give when we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant! \n\nThe food was good, curry was done with medium spice just like we ordered. The naans were just about right although the mango lassi wasn't the best. Overall we were pleased with the food. Just when I was thinking that the place wasn't too bad, the waiter interrupts us, hands over the cheque and asks us to pay immediately since the cash register was \""closing\"". I was *stunned* ! We had just started with our meal !!! Although I was furious, I politely replied that the payment will be done soon after we are done. \n10 minutes after, the floor-manager takes time off from chatting with the staff and with all the \""courtesy\"" asks us to pay up soon. That was it! We quickly gobbled the food, paid and left the place in disgust! \n\nThe food was worth 3 stars but I will never ever visit Delhi Palace again, not now, not ever! For a good Indian meal I would suggest visiting 'Chutneys' , 'Kabab Palace', or even drop by my house, you will not be disappointed!"
"Came here last month with my boyfriend for some sandwiches.  Such...a...disappointment.  As someone who frequents Mill Ave and all of its shops/restaurants/bars often, I often walk past In Season Deli and it's rarely even open.  I thought we had lucked out when we actually saw two people in there so we strolled in.\n\nWe asked for two turkey sandwiches with the works and he also asked for a side of pasta salad.  Now there was only one older woman making the sandwiches, but it literally took about 20 minutes to get our food.  There was literally a fly swirling around their display case of their pastas, puddings, etc.  The lights in the case were blinking the whole time, made it very unappealing.  \n\nNot sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but they didn't even have any of their tables or chairs pulled out for customers, (maybe there weren't any yet that day?) so one of the employees pulled them all out for us and turned the misters on which was enjoyable.\n\nThe sandwiches were nothing special.  Something you would expect to see in a 2nd grader's brown bag lunch.  Regular wheat bread, oscar meyer brand turkey, one piece of lettuce, soggy tomato, mayo, and mustard.  His pasta salad had a film on it from being old, he didn't touch it.  Their sign actually fell off the wall as we tossed our food, it was priceless.\n\nReally wouldn't be surprised if this place closes down."
"I absolutely love this place.  I've been going since they opened, and forgot about them for a while.  Now I took my boyfriend and he's addicted to Fluffy Snow.\n\nFood Reviews:\nPopcorn Chicken - The best I've ever had\nFish Ball- Not good in my opinion, more of a texture thing I guess.  The outside has the same seasoning as the popcorn chicken, but the inside of the ball...It's more of a fish cake texture.  I was expecting something more like batter with fish chunks in it.\nChicken Wings- Still covered in the same seasoning as all the other food, which is quite tasty.  They were kind on the soggy side and the skin was all squishy and not crisp enough for my taste.  It also looked a little pink close to the bone which grossed me out.  I ended up putting them under the toaster oven"
"Very poor experience. I scheduled a body scrub and a facial in person for the following day. I showed my credit card and ID to guarantee per their request. I requested a male therapist.  When I arrived, I was told to go to the mens area. No attendant present. After 10 to 15 minutes, one showed up and told they could not find I made an appointment. I went back down and waited for a therapist to show. That took time. A female therapist came because no male therapist was available. The scrub came first and was basically a superficial massage. Then I had to wait more time for a therapist for the facial which was OK. \nThe place is nice but nothing remarkable compared to other spas in LV and other cities. The front desk staff was cold and distant. \nNever again. No wonder the hotel is in financial troubles."
"Lovely evening out...\nA good little Spanish place...\nIs a nice, fresh meal"
I love this Home Depot. As a supervisor here transferring in from another store all the associates are friendly and very welcoming.  This team is great. I'm glad to be part of the team... As for any of you shoppers.. Please feel free to seek me out here if you need any assistance!!!
"Stop by this place on a whim.  Ordered the Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken (white meat, which is nice).  The Mongolian Beef was very tasty.  But the Orange Chicken could use a bit of improvement on the flavor.  They got the order ready at the time they said they would.  Also the corn egg soup was nice and light.  Would definitely go back to pick up food on this place."
"I'm not even going to waste anymore time with this place and simply say a few words, you could do a lot better! Rude rude rude Roberto on 03/18/12 around 4:00am you need to ease up a bit and take some lessons on hospitality after all you are in the hospitality industry. \n\nThe bad\n\n1. Slow check in and rude front desk clerk\n2. Black jack dealer (female) again rude\n3. Casino floor lacks cocktail servers. I never seen more then one. \n4. If you are lucky and find a cocktail server be prepared to wait 20 or more minuets for your drink. On one accasion the waitress never returned with our drinks. And yes we were tipping well. \n\nThe good\n\n 1. Rooms were very clean but I'm more then sure it had a lot to do with my room attendee Laupe. Laupe I thank you for making my stay tolerable. \n2. Pool drinks and bartenders were excellent. \n3. Valet staff and starters very efficient. \n\nWould I recommend this place? no. I won't even mention it."
"I've been coming to Udupi for about 6 years now. And it's so good that I just keep coming back.\n\nThe food is INCREDIBLE. The spices and flavors are always rich and enticing. The dishes rotate a little different every time, but there's always at least 4-5 main dish options, plus as much rice, bread, soup, and salad you can eat. Oh and dessert too.\n\nI honestly still don't know the names of most of the dishes but I love just about every one they put out. I usually try a little bit of everything over a thin bed of rice, and grab some dipping sauce for the awesome potato-stuffed pancake roll (my naming) they bring to your table.\n\nMost dishes are vegan and gluten free, but you'd be safe to ask if you are strict on either one. I eat mostly GF & vegan myself and it's nice to have a place that caters to my preferences.\n\nI've only ever come for the lunch buffet, which is $10 on weekdays and $13 on weekends, and if you come here hungry you'll get more than your money's worth.\n\nSeriously, grab your friends and check this place out. You won't regret it."
"This place was definitely meh. I was super disappointed because the house is so cute, it still has little rooms like a real house.... very nice.... but the food was just the most bland food I have ever had at a breakfast place, and that includes denny's and the like. That's pretty pathetic. I got the buffalo scramble, which has ground buffalo, onion, bell pepper, tomato, mushroom and jack cheese and comes with toast and hashbrowns. I asked for it with no mushrooms.... no such luck, I got mushrooms. That wasn't a huge deal though. The real problem was the overwhelming lack of any flavor. You would think with that list of ingredients that it would have tons of flavor, but it just tasted like mushy, creamy, nothing. There was way too much cheese and the cheese was bland and nasty.... the buffalo being ground is also not a good idea because it has a weird mouth feel and looks like little turds.... also, buffalo is a beautiful meat, why grind it up? I think the lack of flavor may be because they do not saute the veggies before adding the egg (or at least that's my guess.... not sure) Anyway, I thought maybe the hash browns would be better.... no. Tasted like nothing! WTF? Has this place not heard of seasoning? Finally, the toast was standard, but they only had welch's grape jelly on the table.... for 10$ a plate I should get some nice jam... or at least a choice. So overall, mine was a train wreck. \n\nThe BF got the blueberry pancakes that are supposedly so good.... they aren't. They were soo sweet... disgustingly sweet. They drench the pancakes in blueberry sauce of sorts and it is just super sweet... like sweeter than a regular cake or pie.... I know pancakes are supposed to be sweet, but this was too much. \n\nThe only good part about it was the coffee, they do have good coffee. So if you want good coffee and hate having flavor in your food or money in your wallet... this is the place for you! You can find me up a few blocks north at the much better breakfast establishments on Gilbert rd."
here for happy hour on the patio 1st strike was the lipstick on my draft beer glass. 2nd was the the very rude server who treated our group like we came to dine and dash... the good points the chicken fundio and them accommodating my friends lap dog on their patio. good food bad service. yo Pancho stop being an ass no tip for you buddy.
"Fri & Sats- Latin Vibes Club 1130p-4am. Great Spot if you like Dancing, Latinas & Latin vibes."
Used to play Coldwater on a regular basis.  Held my annual outing there for several years.  For some reason lately there have been an awfully large number of kids and dog-walkers out on the course during regular play recently who have no regard for the players.\n\nMentioned to the clubhouse to see if they could or would do anything but they will not.  Kind of a pickle for me since I live on the course and now I have too many complaints from the players in my outing to return.  It is a good layout and a fun course to play but I just can't get beyond this issue.\n\nIf they could fix this I would be back with my group but not until then.\n\nSorry
"We tried this place because there was a coupon in the Entertainment Book. Since we like the mexican restaurant inside the Tuscany, we figured it was worth trying.\n\nWe had two sandwiches- we split it (our MO). It was very good, surprisingly, for a casino cafe. It's about $10 per person, without the Entertainment coupon. We've been here a couple times. The service is very good. The atmosphere is nice, and this restaurant is spacious inside. There are tables and chairs as well as booth seating available. \n\nIt's truly \""hit or miss\"" at these casino cafes. This is probably one of those little known/forgotten casinos and two of the restaurants here are really good."
"I'm a cheater and a liar. I told Los Olivos I'd be faithful, yet once again I've been a cheating whore. I went to Francis and Sons because they were close and they lured me in with a $9.99 sign. I know, I was dirty and cheap... It didn't think I could be pleased like I am with Los, after all this wasn't going to be a hand job. That was my justification - it wasn't going to be personal... It wouldn't mean anything, it was just a wash. \n\nI hang my head in shame writing this... It wasn't my fault, the machine broke halfway through. I had no choice but to let them finish me off by hand. And it was wonderful, and they waxed my tires for free. \n\nI'm so ashamed.."
"I haven't been here in two years but I can still feel the filet mignon melting in my mouth. The ambience of the indoor dining room is above par, although due to the glamour that is Vegas it pales a little in comparison to some of it's nearby counterparts. The wine list is extensive and fair and their white chocolate martini is one of the best I've ever had. I started with The steak tartare. Of the five times I've had this dish this ranks second (to Tony Bourdain's). The entree was amazing. The truffle mashed potatoes seasoned perfectly, the filet melting in my mouth. They asked my party if we would like to move to the terrace for dessert with water fountains. The chocolate Lave cake was intense and could have used a little more ice cream ala mode. Overall one of the best meals of my life."
"Very nice Asian market with a foodcourt. It's like a mini mall with different stores and restaurants and a food court.  I go here from time to time and love to eat lunch before I do my grocery shopping.  I just went the other day and there was a lot more vendors in the food court and the bakery finally opened up.  At the bakery I got a cream bun, which was yummy with airy and light bread and creamy custard filling.  I also got some cocunut bun thing and the filling was grainy and way too sweet. I also bought a bag of sho-pow with pork and veggie filling and it was pretty good, but later wished I got the honey bbq pork instead."
"Sent me home with a chicken meal instead of the vegetarian one I ordered and I didn't notice until I got home. Couldn't eat it and it was like 118 degrees outside so I decided to not go back. \n\nCalled and let them know about this and the girl I talked to apologized and expressed her sympathy for me and told me that a manager would call me back to take care of this...\n\nNever happened.  Seriously can't stand when people or businesses say they are going to do something but don't. The food is not awful, but this is a part of the \""Service Industry\"" not the we forgot about you after we effed up your order industry. \n\nwon't be back."
"The staff is very welcoming and nice. My checkin and paperwork went very smooth. The clinic is very clean and spacious. It's located in North Las Vegas. I'm new to the area and they got me in very fast for a cleaning. I don't have insurance at the moment, and they have a special for new patients, $40 x-Ray/cleaning! That's an awesome deal. Dr. Arvin Tounian was very warm and he spent time with me explaining my oral health. After a long time I have found a great Dentist and a staff that genuinely cares about their patients!"
"great service, amazing staff, they know their stuff.....whatever it is they have everything i need and even stuff i didn't know i needed"
"Very good chinese food I had since I moved out here. I love their big portions and that they deliver all the time and on time! I love the shrimp with lobster sauce, shrimp walnut, and there egg soup! The family sets are good!"
"We waited almost 35 mintues for two milkshakes. In the mean time, they rushed out food to cars behind us in the drive through - with orders that included ice cream.\nI have never seen a place more disorganized. The employees seemed to have no problem solving skills whatsoever. What a disappontment- they used to be so good!\nIn the end, they handed us a $2 off your next visit coupon (we don't live in Las Vegas, so we'll never be able to use it) as an apology for the poor service."
"My favorite after work hangout!  \n\nAlways consistent with the food quality and taste.  There was only one time my food didn't come out the same and the manager came out to help me replace the order or to take it off my bill.  In addition, she gave me a complimentary glass of wine because I did not want to replace it.  Great service and great food. Fun vibe and has an outdoor area to hanging out and relaxing!"
"I went this morning with my nana for breakfast. We were seated promptly. I noticed right away the walls were dirty and there was hair on the table top. The waitress was slow to take our order. They weren't busy. She took our order and a server brought out our food. They forgot our requested butter and catchup as well as cream for coffee. The waitress never stopped back at the table to check on us but stopped at the table next to us to ask them how they were. I got the spinach, mushroom and bacon omelet. The hash-browns were yummy, but the omelet tasted like it was cooked in old grease and I only ate 2 bites of it. I was dismayed to see they only serve one piece of toast with breakfast. It was dry and hardly buttered. Every restaurant I have ever been to serves 2 pieces of toast. Nana ordered the Beggars Omelet and loved it. However, both she and I felt our food was warm Like it had sat around for a while. We spoke with the manager before we left and voiced our concerns. Maybe it was a bad day & a bad waitress, but all in all, I will never go back here for food. This was at the Greenfield & Broadway location."
Haven't eaten here in over a decade but was hella impressed with the eggs benedict sandwhich. Wait was a little long.
Simply Amazing!
"Not what I expected. It almost looked like a starbucks when I walked in BUT BOY WAS I WRONG Best coffee I have ever had! Beautiful foam designs on every coffee.. Lots of vegan choices, sandwiches, burritos, pastries, an outstanding vegan muffin and regular egg breakfast type sandwiches. A fantastic fun find and a must if you are vegan. Unique and Good"
"I should have followed Yelp's reviews instead of deciding on Dollar's lower rental base price.  They charge for extra drivers, they don't have the car listed on their website, they consider a Chevy Tahoe (Full Size SUV by most other Companies) the same category as a Chevy Suburban (Premium SUV by most other Companies).  \n\nSigned up for the Suburban and given a Tahoe, with not enough room for my travelers and luggage (had to purge some luggage at a relatives home).  This, with the explanation that they consider the Tahoe and Suburban as the same category, and can't do anything about it other than offer me different vehicle that may still not fit my needs.  In addition, the attendants explained that the only Suburban that they have is the one across the parking lot (belonging to the manager!!!!!).\n\n1 star, only because I can't  leave it at ZERO stars!!!!!"
"Headed over for some lunch and to read the LA times.  Been wanting to try Julian Serrano since that MEGAopolis City Center opened and today was the day.  First glance at the outdoor menu they offer daily lunch specials ranging from salads to Spanish influenced sandwiches.  Cheaply priced but not what guided me there, I wanted tapas damnit! The dining area is clean & pristine with a bright color scheme.  I sat at the bar and service was attentive.  Tried 3 items : \n*Pan manchego - toasted bread, tomato sauce, aged manchego \nTerrific flavor.  Simple but encompasses the flavors, temperatures & textures I was looking for\n\n*Spanish chicken croquetas ( aka tentadora )\nChicken & bechamel \nI hoped and prayed this would be the star of show.  I pretended to continue reading my paper but I obsessed about these little nuggets of heaven once I saw them on the menu.  Damn it if it wasn't just my luck.... Disappointment! The crunch and outer texture was heavenly. The bechamel and chicken filling though left me wondering what I had done in a past life to deserve such a tease.   From now on I will refer to these croquetas as the temptress or since it's a Spanish restaurant -  Tentadora\n\nSerrano Rice\nChorizo, chicken, rabbit, Frito, saffron\nFinal dish ordered and it ended on a high note.  All proteins were full of flavor and the sofrito was bold but not overwhelming.  \n\nMid-meal I decided to order a glass of red sangria ( maybe to drown my sorrows from the above listed temptress ).  One of the best red sangria I've had in some time.  If it wasn't the middle of the day and lunch time i could have easily enjoyed two-rty or so.  Not too sweet, great fresh fruit flavor and a nice kick of brandy at the end.  I surprised myself by not finishing it but it was the middle of the day and my work at Julian Serrano was complete.  Very good dining experience for $45 and I would come back for future visits.  Hopefully by that time I will have forgiven that EVIL tentadora......."
"Wow. Friggin WoW.\nI just went last weekend during Labor Day Weekend & it was the best investment when wanting to get away from Nevada trash.\nCirque du Soleil shows, in general, are brilliant but the Beatles Love show is superb! It was a concert, a blast into history slash acrobatic act.\n\nIt tells a story by going through all their songs and the stage set up is amazing! I would recommend this to anyone. Not to mention every seat in the house is a good seat. Its very intimate!"
"I'm not generally a buffet person, as I think I might've mentioned elsewhere in my other buffet-related reviews. However, I do like this one, for several reasons.\n\nOne reason is that, in order to get here, you need to walk through Wynn Las Vegas. This casino is truly A-class. You definitely feel like you're in a much swankier environment than, say, at the Paris' buffet (though the food quality there is also good).\n\nAnother reason is that they offer a wide selection of appetizers, entrees and dessert choices. Something for everyone, I suppose.\n\nLastly, a reason why I like this place is that their serving stations are generally small. That means they don't usually have food out for too long. Since the serving trays are smaller, that means (in my mind) that food is fresher, and better.\n\nOne down side here is that it's $40pp, which is pretty steep for a meal. That said, I believe that's the same price as Rio's buffet , but much more worth it in terms of taste."
I really dislike it when i go to a resturant and do not get acknowledged. 10 min. Is just too long.  Then to serve tepid beer and not offer a glass.  Not good...not good.
"Blah...Very disappointing. I ended up at the San Carlos when it was the only hotel downtown that wasn't sold out. I don't think it was worth the $200 a night, but I didn't have a choice. \n\nThe shower was amazingly tiny. I felt like I was being frisked up against a wall just to wash my hair.\n\nThe walls are super thin. I could hear snoring from one room, coughing from across the hall and the TV on the other side....just awful.\n\nThe staff wasn't very helpful---forgot to program a wake up call, refused to assist when an alarm had been going off in another room for over an hour in the middle of the afternoon, etc. \n\nThe ghost lounge was very cute...I went down and it was a swing night which seemed to be fun. \n\nI'd be willing to come back to the lounge, but not the hotel for sure."
"Visited there June 6, 2013 in the early morning.  Probably right after it opened. \n\nWe were NEVER acknowledged by staff. It was empty inside and I walked right past them several times to see if they would say something like hello to me.  Bad customer service.\n\nBut there is all sorts of Coke drinks, clothing, accessories and home decor.  A Coke drinkers dream. (But I prefer Dr. Pepper!)"
"So the family drove all the way to Vegas from LA to eat at a subpar Pho restaurant.  This is so typical of an Asian family.  So we walked in with a party of 15 and it took 10-15 minutes for us to get seated.  I understood that as this is not a normal sized party.  I ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pho xe lua.  First off, I noticed how much more they charged here compared to LA.  \nThe spring rolls were just ok.  Didn't have much flavor to it.  The dipping sauce did help, but still not that good.  My pho came out and I wasn't sure it was mine because it was a regular sized bowl.  From my experience, xe lua is supposed to be an extra large.  I thought that's why I paid extra for it.  I even asked the server and he said that the xe lua was the same as the dac biet.  \nI was confused, but I still ate it and didn't make a big deal about it.  When I took my first bite, I was underwhelmed by the taste.  The soup didn't have that much flavor even after putting in the hoisin, veggies and lime.  The noodles wasn't fresh tasting like I'm used to.  I forgot to mention that the food was luke warm.  It's not piping hot like it's supposed to be.  The meat was just ok.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  \nAll in all, I would not come back to this establishment if I am ever in Vegas and craving for Pho.  There are so many other choices to choose from, and this one really bites.  The thing that really confuses me is that this is part of a chain and there is one located in Van Nuys that taste better than this place.  Food quality is definitely lacking at this Vegas location and they need to re-evaluate their whole business strategy."
"On our first morning in Las Vegas we chose the breakfast buffet where we were staying. It was unusually busy for a Thursday morning due to an influx of cowboys attending a bovine sale as well as the start of the PBR finals.  My breakfast included OJ, fresh fruit with strawberry yogurt, easy over eggs, a sliver of ham, bacon and a Tums. Everything was reasonably fresh.  We used our funbook coupons received at check-in.\n\nWe returned a week later for the luncheon buffet using a pair of free buffet coupons from an additional pair of funbooks.  I enjoyed a few small cocktail shrimp, a tomato salad, one BBQ pork rib, a few tiny meatballs and a fresh fruit tart."
"\""Festival Seating\"", huh?  There was no warning when I bought tickets for this venue . . . and what a shock to see that there were no seats.  Security folks made us stand up well before the concert started, probably because folks were packed in there way past what would be deemed a safe volume of people.\n\nThe sound system was not good, acoustics were poor, the sound was over-processed.  It was a horrible experience; my worst concert to date.  I would suggest buying the artists DVD instead of going to see them live, at this venue."
"Oh boy!  My husband needed prgressive lenses.  The girl who helped (?) us told me we should get the \""premium\"" progressive as opposed to the standard.  I asked what the difference in price was and she WOULDNT TELL ME!  She figured it all out nd showed my, like a car salesman, on a computer, a price of $171.  With insurance!  When I said that was a lot, she said we should get insurance on the glasses for another $30!  Good luck with that, sister.   I later found out the standard progressive is $75 with our insurance. We walked and ordered the same glasses online from zinni for a grand total of $61 without using insurrance.  Hold on to the wallet here, folks!"
I love this place! Haven't had anything yet that I didn't like. Service is always outstanding and the prices are very reasonable. It's my go to for Chinese. In fact when my parents visit it's their request on where to eat lol!
"The ambiance is deliciously dark and a throwback to the grand old days of quality tablecloths and real silverware.\nThe service here was very sub-par.  Perhaps that was because I was dressed like an ignorant tourist that just wanted to be comfortable checking out the city---FYI--tourists have money to spend, too...\nI hate the fact that most upscale steak restaurants ignores the needs of patrons who want to watch their waistline.\nMy husband likes steak, BUT--- I want to eat healthy.  So, how about some healthy options, Capital?  \nI had to special order my salad and take off a bunch of junk. There entree-sized salad was fit for a mouse that had already eaten...I  left hungry! Ugh.\nPlus---my special order came out wrong and I had to (once again) watch my husband eat while I fantasized about how many carbs were in the napkin...\nOh, I won't be coming back.  There are too many other great places to spend my well-earned money on."
"This place is awesome, plus the dance floor is spacious and music is great! Local night is on Sunday, but get in line early because the line will be 1 hour or more... My suggestion is to find promoter and get on guest list, which will make your life easier!"
"I have been going to Bill Johnson's since the 1970s.  I haven't been to the one on Van Buren in years, but I used to love that location.  However, I can only speak of my recent experiences at this location, and they have left a lot to be desired.  \n\nNormally I don't try a place more than twice if I have a bad experience, but since I recall Bill Johnson's with such fondness, I gave them more opportunities than I probably should have.  After four consecutive visits I can say that this location is very consistent.  Unfortunately, it has been consistently mediocre at best.  So here goes...\n\nI waited a long time to be greeted at the front.\n\nI waited even longer for the waitress to come around.\n\nI waited longer still to have her return with our food after ordering.  \n\nThe food seemed like it was made before I even ordered it.  \n\nThe burgers were smaller than I remember.  To say the steak looked like it was a Denny's breakfast steak is an insult to Denny's, and at least Denny's is cheap.  The ribs were barely room temperature.  The best thing was the fish sticks on the kids menu, which makes no sense considering there is an angry bull on the front of the restaurant.  Come to think of it, maybe that is why he is angry. \n\nI'm still a sucker for all the junk hanging everywhere.  I wish they would replace the light bulbs in some of their Conestoga Wagons, but I would settle for fresh food that didn't take an eternity to arrive at my table.  On second thought, I would settle for the way it used to be."
"I spent 5 weeks out of the country and the first place I spent money upon my return is this home away from home. It's a great location, yummy products, priced right, and a fabulous staff!"
"There's something to be said about going to a restaurant and being welcomed as a friend.  I had been traveling for 6 weeks, and returned to Centotre for the morning event held there ever Friday (The Edinburgh Coffee Morning - EdCM) - and was welcomed by smiles, kisses, hugs and handshakes from staff and owners.  \n\nBeing recognised by staff at a restaurant is something that takes effort - the staff have to pay attention, and you can't force that.  Friendliness can't be forced either.  But it also requires something else - longevity.  Indeed, I recognise now that there isn't a big staff turnover here - they like working here. That makes the experience even more special."
"Adding to what the girls have outlined, I can't help but wonder why this shop is open all year round.\n\nSaying that, it has its uses - it keeps visitors and locals up to speed on upcoming Fringe events, and nearer the time (i.e from June onward) you can buy tickets for various shows to guarantee your front row seat.\n\nIt sells some Fringe merch, which seems a bit empty unless you are actually at the Fringe that year and want something to remember it by. But I can imagine some tourists being interested in the t shirts and teddies they have on offer.\n\nLike Eleanor, I find the Fringe Shop's year long opening a little bit pointless. But if I need to use it nearer the time of the festival, which I sometimes do, I am usually caught saying the opposite. So I'm four starring it since it's a great resource of information if you're wanting to secure your place in or at the Fringe early!"
"Pretty disappointed. Came here with a friend and the fianc\u00e9 on my last trip to Vegas. We were tired of walking and wanted a bite to eat late at night. We saw the good reviews and though we'd give it a try. We ordered the jambalaya and ahi tuna tartare. The food fell below my expectations. I thought it would be similar to cheesecake factory, but the food was worse than than cheesecake factory for sure. \n\nFood: \nChicken jambalaya: pretty weird, but okay in taste. The chicken was separated from the rice, which isn't traditional of jambalaya. it was more of a stir fry spicy chicken with the rice on the side. \nAhi tuna tartare- Not the best. Didn't stand out and not particularly appetizing for me, but I'm a raw fish/sushi snob. \n\nPrice: pretty expensive for the quality. Similar to the cheesecake factory price wise.\n\nOverall, if your desperate and hungry and don't want to go off the strip maybe consider eating here, otherwise take your money and appetite off the strip. Some of the restaurants in the asian town are open pretty late."
"If I were in charge of an M&M store on the strip, I would have:\n\n- free samples!\n- life-size huggable M&Ms\n- a demonstration of M&Ms melting in your mouth, not your hand, even in the Vegas desert \n- hot chicks and dudes clad only in M&Ms\n- a glamourous bar/lounge featuring candy-colored cocktails and novelty beer with M&Ms floating in it\n- a Cirque du Soleil show where the acrobats only wear M&Ms\n- high stakes poker with the life-size huggable M&Ms as dealers\n- strippers\n\nBut someone else is in charge of the M&M store on the Strip, and so it doesn't have any of those things. Instead it has:\n\n- four floors of stuff that says M&Ms on it for sale\n- a cheesy 3-D movie\n- a (probably cheesy) tour I didn't go on\n- NO FREE SAMPLES\n\nI guess that's probably more in line with the M&M brand than strippers, booze, and gambling, but then I don't really understand what they're doing on the strip. Whatever."
"Definitely not one of the best happy hours I've had unfortunately... =/\n\nMy co workers wanted to come here for happy hour since it's right down the street from our office. I never even knew it was here since  the location is not great at all. It is not close to the main intersection but close to the back street instead. When you first walk in, it's sooooo dark in there! I almost felt like I needed to turn on the flashlight on my phone to see. lol. \n\nI think the happy hour drink specials were not that bad. $2.50 for wells and wine and certain beers. I got the Pinot Grigio wine. Obviously this place isn't a wine bar so it wasn't that great. We ordered some appetizers as well. The nachos were a fail. =/ It was that type of cheese that wasn't necessarily melted on there but just straight up dry and stuck together on the chips. The wings were ok as well. My co workers ordered the spicy ones. I'm a total wuss and can't handle spicy at all but these were actually not even spicy. \n\nI guess this was an ok place to hang out. I like that they also have pool tables and air hockey to keep you occupied I guess while you're waiting for your food. Because our service was extremely slow. I probably won't be coming back unless the co workers wanted to or for some $2.50 drinks. =P"
"Not a fan. Do not go to Casino Royale in Vegas. This is a sham! They will promise you game play and it is impossible to make it happen under their guidelines. Then, they will simply apologize and tell you there is nothing more they can do for you. The best part is you have to run a $20 through their machines first and get or to a zero balance before their $20 will kick in..."
"When my sister-in-law told me there was a resale kids shop in Las Vegas, I organized a bunch of stuff and hauled it in the next day. I think that they give about 10-15% of their sale price. Here is an example: I sold them my son's $50 Lucky Brand Jeans. They'll sell them for $12 or so which means I'll get $1.20 for those perfect condition jeans. \n\nI went in there with tons of jeans, jackets, shirts (mostly all of which were baby gap), a stroller, rainforest play gym, and a luxe boppy. This was easily $600 worth of stuff and when I saw that they bought everything, I expected quite a bit of money. Intead, I got $41. \n\nI later went back there to sell small toys because toys probably wouldn't sell for much at a yardsale or on eBay anyway, but I saw the $60 play gym I sold them selling for $25 which means I got $2.50 for it. There was also the same playgym there missing various pieces and filthy selling for $20 which means I only got paid $0.50 more. I will definitely be selling my stuff on eBay and Craigslist and bringing in the rejects to this store. \n\nShopping here on the other hand is a bargain. Some of their stuff is still new including robeez shoes ($40 at Daggermans) selling for $10. I will probably come here to buy a new pair of robeez and maybe some toys for the kiddos."
"Dr. Rumman is NOT a helpful doctor, and she doesn't answer all my questions. Her whole attitude at the hospital seemed arrogant and least understanding."
"Horrible. I wasn't thrilled the first time I went. My gel manicure came out bubbly and started cracking. When I went back a couple weeks later for a polish change, Cindy the Mutilator had me \""soak\"" my fingers in acetone for all of 1 second before she took a dremel to my nails (mind you, my REAL nails, NOT acrylic!) and proceeded to cut the cuticle and skin of six of my fingers. How the other four escaped her wrath, I don't know. Then she had me soak again in acetone and then alcohol - ow, ow, ow! I was in tears. Now here I am with six bleeding phallanges and was still expected to pay full price. Never again! There are hundreds of nail salons out there, DO NOT GO HERE!"
"I visited Hana with friends on my recent visit to Phoenix. We had an awesome experience. The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and attentive, and the food was outstanding - the fish was fresh as can be (despite being far from water) - and the noodles and salad were tastefully done. I've heard there's oftentimes a wait (they are small and don't take reservations), but we went after the lunch rush and didn't have a problem. Some of the best Japanese I've had!"
"Disappointing. \nService (just the server) was middle of the road to poor. Expected a lot more from a Thomas Keller place. \nOysters were good. Server forgot oyster forks and a bowl. Brought them after we asked. \nPate was off the charts good. \nFoie gras was bland. Some of the worst I've ever had. Wtf? Tasteless and like refrigerated lard. Lacked the wonderful textures and nuanced flavor that good foie gras has. Sigh.\n\nMy friend's fish was on the bland side. Or uninspired. Lacking something. My pork short ribs were really tasty, but both of our entrees were on the just barely warm side. More Wtf. \nDessert order was taken. Server returned to explain they were out of the one my friend ordered. Ok. I know it happens. Just added to the sense that the server wasn't paying attention. Dessert was dropped and table hadn't been marked (no silverware).  Another server noticed and brought us silverware.\n\nThe back server (or busboy if you must call him that, though you ought not to) however: Amazing. This guy was on top of everything he could be expected to be from start to finish. HE was what we expected from the place. Changed plates, checked on us (when the server was off schmoozing the table of hot ladies next to us (yeah, I get it, they're hot and we're just a couple of guys, but we're ordering well and aren't you just the least bit aware of the difference in service you're providing our two tables when we're right next to each other and we can SEE it??).... oh wait, I was talking about how great the back server was... Right. He was great. Crumbed. Refilled. Fast. Expedient. Made us feel at the least... cared about? Noticed? Something like that.\n\nLower than average overall experience.\n\nPalmed the back server cash on the way out. 20% to the server because you do. And sadly, wouldn't  go back."
